manners all rest two families always been excellent terms there being no pride one side no envy other only such consciousness superiority miss musgroves made pleased improve cousins charles s attentions henrietta been observed father mother without any disapprobation great match if henrietta liked henrietta seem like henrietta fully thought herself before captain wentworth came time cousin charles been very much forgotten which two sisters preferred captain wentworth yet quite doubtful far anne s observation reached henrietta perhaps prettiest louisa higher spirits knew now whether more

jennings desirous feeling besides circumstance opinion justify such lasting amazement variety speculation wonder otherwise disposed engrossed extraordinary silence sister willoughby subject which must know peculiarly interesting all silence continued every day made appear more strange more incompatible disposition both why should openly acknowledge mother herself what constant behaviour each other declared taken place elinor imagine easily conceive marriage might immediately power though willoughby independent there no reason believe rich his estate been rated sir john six seven hundred year lived expense which income hardly equal himself often complained his poverty strange kind secrecy maintained relative engagement which fact concealed nothing all account wholly contradictory general

share mrs dashwood looked pleasure marianne whose fine eyes fixed expressively willoughby plainly denoted how well understood how often wish added when allenham time twelvemonth barton cottage inhabited never passed within view without admiring its situation grieving no one should live how little think very first news should hear mrs smith when next came country barton cottage taken felt

torment myself any longer remaining among friends whose society impossible now enjoy hastily took leave all left room saw step his carriage minute sight mrs dashwood felt too much speech instantly quitted parlour give way solitude concern alarm which sudden departure occasioned elinor s uneasiness least equal mother s thought what passed anxiety distrust willoughby s behaviour taking leave his embarrassment affectation cheerfulness above all his unwillingness accept mother s invitation backwardness unlike lover unlike himself greatly disturbed one moment feared no serious design ever been formed his side next some unfortunate quarrel taken place between sister distress which marianne quitted room such serious quarrel most reasonably account though when considered what marianne s love quarrel seemed almost impossible whatever might particulars separation sister s affliction indubitable thought tenderest compassion violent sorrow which marianne all probability merely giving way relief feeding encouraging duty half hour mother returned though eyes red countenance uncheerful dear willoughby now some miles barton elinor said sat work how heavy heart travel all very strange suddenly gone seems work moment last night us happy cheerful affectionate now after only ten minutes notice gone too without intending return something more what owned us must happened speak behave like himself must seen difference well what quarrelled why else should shown such unwillingness accept invitation here inclination wanted elinor plainly see power accepting thought all assure perfectly account every thing first seemed strange well indeed yes explained myself most satisfactory way elinor who love doubt where satisfy know shall talk trust am persuaded mrs smith suspects his regard marianne disapproves perhaps because other views account eager get away business which sends off transact invented excuse dismiss what believe happened moreover aware disapprove connection dares therefore present confess his engagement marianne feels himself obliged his dependent situation give schemes absent himself devonshire while tell know may may happened listen no cavil unless point any other method understanding affair satisfactory now elinor what say nothing anticipated answer told might might happened oh elinor how incomprehensible feelings rather take evil upon credit good rather look misery marianne guilt poor willoughby apology latter resolved think blameable because took leave us less affection his usual behaviour shown no allowance made inadvertence spirits depressed recent disappointment no probabilities accepted merely because certainties nothing due man whom all such reason love no reason world think ill possibility motives unanswerable themselves though unavoidably secret while after all what suspect hardly tell myself suspicion something unpleasant inevitable consequence such alteration witnessed there great truth however what now urged allowances which ought made wish candid judgment every body willoughby may undoubtedly very sufficient reasons his conduct hope been more like willoughby acknowledge once secrecy may advisable still cannot help wondering its being practiced blame however departing his character where deviation necessary really admit justice what said his defence am happy acquitted entirely may proper conceal engagement if engaged mrs smith if case must highly expedient willoughby little devonshire present no excuse concealing us concealing us dear child accuse willoughby marianne concealment strange indeed when eyes been reproaching every day incautiousness want no proof affection said elinor engagement am perfectly satisfied both yet syllable been said subject either wanted syllables where actions spoken plainly his behaviour marianne all us least last fortnight declared loved considered his future wife felt us attachment nearest relation perfectly understood each other consent been daily asked his looks his manner his attentive affectionate respect elinor possible doubt engagement how such thought occur how supposed willoughby persuaded must sister s love should leave leave perhaps months without telling his affection should part without mutual exchange confidence confess replied elinor every circumstance except one favour engagement one total silence both subject almost outweighs every other how strange must think wretchedly indeed willoughby if after all openly passed between doubt nature terms which together been acting part his behaviour sister all time suppose really indifferent no cannot think must love am sure strange kind tenderness if leave such indifference such carelessness future attribute must remember dear mother never considered matter certain doubts confess fainter may soon entirely done away if find correspond every fear mine removed mighty concession indeed if see altar suppose going married ungracious girl require no such proof nothing opinion ever passed justify doubt no secrecy been attempted all been uniformly open unreserved cannot doubt sister s wishes must willoughby therefore whom suspect why man honour feeling there been any inconsistency his side create alarm deceitful hope believe cried elinor love willoughby sincerely love suspicion his integrity cannot more painful yourself been involuntary encourage startled confess alteration his manners morning speak like himself return kindness any cordiality all may explained such situation his affairs supposed parted sister seen leave greatest affliction if felt obliged fear offending mrs smith resist temptation returning here soon yet aware declining invitation saying going away some time should seem act ungenerous suspicious part family might well embarrassed disturbed such case plain open avowal his difficulties been more his honour think well more consistent his general character raise objections against any one s conduct illiberal foundation difference judgment myself deviation what may think right consistent speak very properly willoughby certainly deserve suspected though known long no stranger part world who ever spoken his disadvantage been situation act independently marry immediately might been odd should leave us without acknowledging everything once case engagement some respects prosperously begun marriage must very uncertain distance even secrecy far observed may now very advisable interrupted entrance margaret elinor liberty think representations mother acknowledge probability many hope justice all saw nothing marianne till dinner time when entered room took place table without saying word eyes red swollen seemed if tears even restrained difficulty avoided looks all neither eat nor speak after some time mother s silently pressing hand tender compassion small degree fortitude quite overcome burst tears left room violent oppression spirits continued whole evening without any power because without any desire command herself slightest

walks silent meditations still produced occasional effusions sorrow lively ever no letter willoughby came none seemed expected marianne mother surprised elinor again became uneasy mrs dashwood find explanations whenever wanted which least satisfied herself remember elinor said how very often sir john fetches letters himself post carries already agreed secrecy may necessary must acknowledge maintained if correspondence pass through sir john s hands elinor deny truth tried find motive sufficient silence there one method direct simple opinion eligible knowing real state affair instantly removing all mystery help suggesting mother why ask marianne once said whether engaged willoughby mother kind indulgent mother question give offence natural result affection used all unreserve more especially ask such question world supposing possible engaged what distress such enquiry inflict any rate most ungenerous should never deserve confidence again after forcing confession what meant present unacknowledged any one know marianne s heart know dearly loves shall last whom affair made known when circumstances make revealment eligible attempt force confidence any one child much less because sense duty prevent denial which wishes might direct elinor thought generosity overstrained considering sister s youth urged matter farther vain common sense common care common prudence all

grace gave distinction person manners particularly civil elinor soon allowed credit some kind sense when saw what constant judicious attention making themselves agreeable lady middleton children continual raptures extolling beauty courting notice humouring whims such time spared importunate demands which politeness made spent admiration whatever ladyship doing if happened doing any thing taking patterns some elegant new dress which appearance day before thrown unceasing delight fortunately those who pay court through such foibles fond mother though pursuit praise children most rapacious human beings likewise most credulous demands exorbitant swallow any thing excessive affection endurance miss steeles towards offspring viewed therefore lady middleton without smallest surprise distrust saw maternal complacency all impertinent encroachments mischievous tricks which cousins submitted saw sashes untied hair pulled ears work bags searched knives scissors stolen away felt no doubt its being reciprocal enjoyment suggested no other surprise elinor marianne should sit composedly without claiming share what passing john such spirits today said his taking miss steeles

remembering scene similar distress last week some apricot marmalade been successfully applied bruised temple same remedy eagerly proposed unfortunate scratch slight intermission screams young lady hearing gave reason hope rejected carried room therefore mother s arms quest medicine two boys chose follow though earnestly entreated mother stay behind four young ladies left quietness which room known many hours poor little creatures said miss steele soon gone might been very sad accident yet hardly know how cried marianne unless been totally different circumstances usual way heightening alarm where there nothing alarmed reality what sweet woman lady middleton said lucy steele marianne silent impossible say what feel however trivial occasion upon elinor therefore whole task telling lies when politeness required always fell best when thus called speaking lady middleton more warmth felt though far less miss lucy sir john too cried elder sister what charming man here too miss dashwood s commendation being only simple came without any eclat merely observed perfectly good humoured friendly what charming little family never saw such fine children life declare quite doat upon already indeed am always distractedly fond children should guess said elinor smile what witnessed morning notion said lucy think little middletons rather too much indulged perhaps may outside enough natural lady middleton part love see children full life spirits cannot bear if tame quiet confess replied elinor while am barton park never think tame quiet children any abhorrence short pause succeeded speech which first broken miss steele who seemed very much disposed conversation who now said rather abruptly how like devonshire miss dashwood suppose very sorry leave sussex some surprise familiarity question least manner which spoken elinor replied norland prodigious beautiful place added miss steele heard sir john admire excessively said lucy who seemed think some apology necessary freedom sister think every one must admire replied elinor who ever saw place though supposed any one estimate its beauties great many smart beaux there suppose many part world part think vast addition always why should think said lucy looking ashamed sister there many genteel young men devonshire sussex nay dear m sure don t pretend say there t m sure there s vast many smart beaux exeter know how

before married rich upon word replied elinor cannot tell perfectly comprehend meaning word say if ever beau before married one still there smallest alteration oh dear one never thinks married men s being beaux something else lord anne cried sister talk nothing beaux make miss dashwood believe think nothing else turn discourse began admiring house furniture specimen miss steeles enough vulgar freedom folly eldest left no recommendation elinor blinded beauty shrewd look youngest want real elegance artlessness left house without any wish knowing better miss steeles came exeter well provided admiration use sir john middleton his family all his relations no niggardly proportion now dealt his fair cousins whom declared most beautiful elegant accomplished agreeable girls ever beheld whom particularly anxious better acquainted better acquainted therefore elinor soon found inevitable lot sir john entirely side miss steeles party too strong opposition kind intimacy must submitted which consists sitting hour two together same room almost every day sir john no more know any more required together his opinion intimate while his continual schemes meeting effectual doubt being established friends justice every thing his power promote unreserve making miss steeles acquainted whatever knew supposed his cousins situations most delicate particulars elinor seen more twice before eldest wished joy sister s having been lucky make conquest very smart beau since came barton twill fine thing married young sure said hear quite beau prodigious handsome hope may good luck yourself soon perhaps may friend corner already elinor suppose sir john more nice proclaiming his suspicions regard edward been respect marianne indeed rather his favourite joke two being somewhat newer more conjectural since edward s visit never dined together without his drinking best affections much significancy many nods winks excite general attention letter f been likewise invariably brought forward found productive such countless jokes its character wittiest letter alphabet been long established elinor miss steeles expected now all benefit these jokes eldest raised curiosity know name gentleman alluded which though often impertinently expressed perfectly piece general inquisitiveness concerns family sir john sport long curiosity which delighted raise least much pleasure telling name miss steele hearing his name ferrars said very audible whisper pray tell s great secret ferrars repeated miss steele mr ferrars happy man what sister law s brother miss dashwood very agreeable young man

surprise who uncle where live how came acquainted wished very much subject continued though chuse join herself nothing more said first time life thought mrs jennings deficient either curiosity after petty information disposition communicate manner which miss steele spoken edward increased curiosity struck being rather ill natured suggested suspicion lady s knowing fancying herself know something his disadvantage curiosity unavailing no farther notice taken mr ferrars s name miss steele when alluded even openly mentioned sir john marianne who never much toleration any thing like impertinence vulgarity inferiority parts even difference taste herself time particularly ill disposed state spirits pleased miss steeles encourage advances invariable coldness behaviour towards which checked every endeavour intimacy side elinor principally attributed preference herself which soon became evident manners both especially lucy who missed no opportunity engaging conversation striving improve acquaintance easy frank communication sentiments lucy naturally clever remarks often amusing companion half hour elinor frequently found agreeable powers received no aid education ignorant illiterate deficiency all mental improvement want information most common particulars concealed miss dashwood spite constant endeavour appear advantage elinor saw pitied neglect abilities which education might rendered respectable saw less tenderness feeling thorough want delicacy rectitude integrity mind which attentions assiduities flatteries park betrayed no lasting satisfaction company person who joined insincerity ignorance whose want instruction prevented meeting conversation terms equality whose conduct toward others made every show attention deference towards herself perfectly valueless think question odd one dare say said lucy one day walking together park cottage pray personally acquainted sister law s mother mrs ferrars elinor think question very odd one countenance expressed answered never seen mrs ferrars indeed replied lucy wonder thought must seen norland sometimes perhaps cannot tell what sort woman no returned elinor cautious giving real opinion edward s mother very desirous satisfying what seemed impertinent curiosity know nothing am sure think very strange enquiring such way said lucy eyeing elinor attentively spoke perhaps there may reasons wish might venture however hope justice believing mean impertinent elinor made civil reply walked few minutes silence broken lucy who renewed subject again saying some hesitation cannot bear think impertinently curious am sure rather any thing world thought person whose good opinion well worth having yours am sure should smallest fear trusting indeed should very glad advice how manage such uncomfortable situation am however there no occasion trouble am sorry happen know mrs ferrars am sorry said elinor great astonishment if any use know opinion really never understood all connected family therefore am little surprised

intimately connected looked said amiably bashful only one side glance companion observe its effect good heavens cried elinor what mean acquainted mr robert ferrars feel much delighted idea such sister law no replied lucy mr robert ferrars never saw life fixing eyes upon elinor his eldest brother what felt elinor moment astonishment been painful strong immediate disbelief assertion attended turned towards lucy silent amazement unable divine reason object such declaration though complexion varied stood firm incredulity felt no danger hysterical fit swoon may well surprised continued lucy sure no idea before dare say never dropped smallest hint any family because always meant great secret am sure been faithfully kept hour soul all relations know anne never should mentioned if felt greatest dependence world upon secrecy really thought behaviour asking many questions mrs ferrars must seem odd ought explained think mr ferrars displeased when knows trusted because know highest opinion world all family looks upon yourself other miss dashwoods quite his own sisters paused elinor few moments remained silent astonishment what heard first too great words length forcing herself speak speak cautiously said calmness manner which tolerably well concealed surprise solicitude may ask if engagement long standing been engaged these four years four years yes elinor though greatly shocked still

his thinking necessary supposed proper etiquette what elinor said reply distinguish judged motion lips think any material objection mrs jennings commended heart being honest talked few minutes longer without catching syllable when another lucky stop marianne s performance brought these words colonel s calm voice am afraid cannot take place very soon astonished shocked unlover like speech almost ready cry lord what should hinder checking desire confined herself silent ejaculation very strange sure need wait older delay colonel s side however seem offend mortify his fair companion least breaking conference soon afterwards moving different ways mrs jennings very plainly heard elinor say voice which showed feel what said shall always think myself very much obliged mrs jennings delighted gratitude only wondered after hearing such sentence colonel should able take leave immediately utmost sang froid go away without making any reply thought old friend made indifferent suitor what really passed between effect heard said great compassion injustice friend mr ferrars suffered his family if understand matter right been entirely cast off persevering his engagement very deserving young woman been rightly informed elinor told cruelty impolitic cruelty replied great feeling dividing attempting divide two young people long attached each other terrible mrs ferrars know

receiving obligation been very glad spared herself colonel brandon motives equal delicacy declining likewise still seemed desirous its being given through means any account make farther opposition edward believed still town fortunately heard his address miss steele undertake therefore inform course day after been settled colonel brandon began talk his own advantage securing respectable agreeable neighbour mentioned regret house small indifferent evil which elinor mrs jennings supposed made very light least far regarded its size smallness house said cannot imagine any inconvenience proportion family income which colonel surprised find considering mr ferrars s marriage certain consequence presentation suppose possible delaford living supply such income anybody his style life venture settle said little rectory no more make mr ferrars comfortable bachelor cannot enable marry am sorry say patronage ends interest hardly more extensive if however unforeseen chance should power serve farther must think very differently what now if am ready useful sincerely wish present what am now doing indeed seems nothing all since advance little towards what must his principal his only object happiness his marriage must still distant good least am afraid cannot take place very soon such sentence which when misunderstood justly offended delicate feelings mrs jennings after narration what really passed between colonel brandon elinor while stood window gratitude expressed latter parting may perhaps appear general less reasonably excited nor less properly worded if arisen offer marriage well miss dashwood said mrs jennings sagaciously smiling soon gentleman withdrawn ask what colonel been saying though upon honour tried keep hearing help catching enough understand his business assure never better pleased life wish joy all heart thank ma am said elinor matter great joy feel goodness colonel brandon most sensibly there many men who act done few people who

things forward between dear rather character should colonel write himself sure proper person elinor quite understand beginning mrs jennings s speech neither think worth inquiring therefore only replied its conclusion colonel brandon delicate man rather wished any one announce his intentions mr ferrars himself forced well odd kind delicacy however disturb seeing preparing write know own concerns best goodby dear heard any thing please well since charlotte brought bed away went returning again moment been thinking betty s sister dear should very glad get good mistress whether lady s

should express herself note edward now all concern particular circumstances between made difficulty which any other person been easiest thing world equally feared say too much too little sat deliberating paper pen hand till broken entrance edward himself met mrs jennings door way carriage came leave his farewell card after apologising returning herself obliged enter saying miss dashwood above wanted speak very particular business elinor been congratulating herself midst perplexity however difficult might express herself properly letter least preferable giving information word mouth when visitor entered force upon greatest exertion all astonishment confusion very great his sudden appearance seen before since his engagement became public therefore since his knowing acquainted which consciousness what been thinking what tell made feel particularly uncomfortable some minutes too much distressed sat together most promising state embarrassment whether asked pardon his intrusion first coming room recollect determining safe side made his apology form soon say any thing after taking chair mrs jennings told said wished speak least understood certainly should intruded such manner though same time should been extremely sorry leave london without seeing sister especially most likely some time probable should soon pleasure meeting again go oxford tomorrow gone however said elinor recovering herself determined get what much dreaded soon possible without receiving good wishes even if been able give person mrs jennings quite right what said something consequence inform which point communicating paper am charged most agreeable office breathing rather faster usual spoke colonel brandon who here only ten minutes ago desired say understanding mean take orders great pleasure offering living delaford now vacant only wishes more valuable allow congratulate having respectable well judging friend join his wish living two hundred year much more considerable such might better enable might more temporary accommodation yourself such short might establish all views happiness what edward felt say himself cannot expected any one else should say looked all astonishment which such unexpected such unthought information fail exciting said only these two words colonel brandon yes continued elinor gathering more resolution some worst colonel brandon means testimony his concern what lately passed cruel situation which unjustifiable conduct family placed concern which am sure marianne myself all friends must share likewise proof his high esteem general character his particular approbation behaviour present occasion colonel brandon give living possible unkindness own relations made astonished find friendship any where no replied sudden consciousness find cannot ignorant goodness owe all feel express if well know am no orator very much mistaken assure owe entirely least almost entirely own merit colonel brandon s discernment no hand even know till understood his design living vacant nor ever occurred might such living his gift friend mine family may perhaps indeed know still greater pleasure bestowing upon word owe nothing solicitation truth obliged acknowledge some small share action same time unwilling appear benefactress edward acknowledged hesitation which probably contributed fix suspicion his mind which recently entered short time sat deep thought after elinor ceased speak last if rather effort said colonel brandon seems man great worth respectability always heard spoken such brother know esteems highly undoubtedly sensible man his manners perfectly gentleman indeed replied elinor believe find farther acquaintance all heard such very near neighbours understand parsonage almost close mansion house particularly important should all edward made no answer when turned away head gave look serious earnest uncheerful seemed say might hereafter wish distance between parsonage mansion house much greater colonel brandon think lodges st james street said soon afterwards rising his chair elinor told number house must hurry away give those thanks which allow give assure made very exceedingly happy man elinor offer detain parted very earnest assurance side unceasing good wishes his happiness every change situation might befall his rather attempt return same good power expressing when see again said elinor herself door shut shall see husband lucy pleasing anticipation sat reconsider past recall words endeavour comprehend all feelings edward course reflect own discontent when mrs jennings came home though returned seeing people whom never seen before whom therefore must great deal say mind much more occupied important secret possession anything else reverted again soon elinor appeared well dear cried sent young man right suppose no great difficulty find very unwilling accept proposal no ma am very likely well how soon ready seems all depend upon really said elinor know little these kind forms hardly even

put quite patience though one very glad kindness poor mr ferrars think worth while wait two three months sure somebody else might found well somebody orders already dear ma am said elinor what thinking why colonel brandon s only object use mr ferrars lord bless dear sure mean persuade colonel only marries sake giving ten guineas mr ferrars deception continue after explanation immediately took place which both gained considerable amusement moment without any material loss happiness either mrs jennings only exchanged one form delight another still without forfeiting expectation first aye aye parsonage small one said after first ebullition surprise satisfaction very likely may repair hear man apologising thought house knowledge five sitting rooms ground floor think housekeeper told make fifteen beds too been used live barton cottage seems quite ridiculous dear must touch colonel some thing parsonage make comfortable before lucy goes colonel brandon seem any idea living s being enough allow marry colonel ninny dear because two thousand year himself thinks nobody else marry less take word if am alive shall paying visit delaford parsonage before michaelmas am sure shan t go if lucy t there elinor quite opinion probability waiting any thing more edward having carried his thanks colonel brandon proceeded his happiness lucy such excess time reached bartlett s buildings able assure mrs jennings who called again next day congratulations never seen such spirits before life own happiness own spirits least very certain joined mrs jennings most heartily expectation being all comfortably together delaford parsonage before michaelmas far same time any backwardness give elinor credit which edward give spoke friendship both most grateful warmth ready own all obligation openly declared no exertion good miss dashwood s part either present future ever surprise believed capable doing any thing world those really valued colonel brandon only ready worship saint moreover truly anxious should treated one all worldly concerns anxious his tithes should raised utmost secretly resolved avail herself delaford far possibly his servants his carriage his cows his poultry now above week since john dashwood called berkeley street since time no notice been taken his wife s indisposition beyond one verbal enquiry elinor began feel necessary pay visit obligation however which only opposed own inclination which assistance any encouragement companions marianne contented absolutely refusing go herself very urgent prevent sister s going all mrs jennings though carriage always elinor s service very much disliked mrs john dashwood even curiosity see how looked after late discovery nor strong desire affront taking edward s part overcome unwillingness company again consequence elinor set herself pay visit which no one really less inclination run risk t te t te woman whom neither others much reason dislike mrs dashwood denied before carriage turn house husband accidentally came expressed great pleasure meeting elinor told been going call berkeley street assuring fanny very glad see invited come walked stairs drawing room nobody there fanny own room suppose said go presently am sure least objection world seeing very far indeed now especially there cannot however marianne always great favourites why marianne come elinor made what excuse am sorry see alone replied good deal say living colonel brandon s true really given edward heard yesterday chance coming purpose enquire farther perfectly true colonel brandon given living delaford edward really well very astonishing no relationship no connection between now livings fetch such price what value two hundred year very well next presentation living value supposing late incumbent been old sickly likely vacate soon might got dare say fourteen hundred pounds how came settled matter before person s death now indeed too late sell man colonel brandon s sense wonder should improvident point such common such natural concern well am convinced there vast deal inconsistency almost every human character suppose however recollection case may probably edward only hold living till person whom colonel really sold presentation old enough take aye aye fact depend upon elinor contradicted however very positively relating herself been employed conveying offer colonel brandon edward therefore must understand terms which given obliged submit authority truly astonishing cried after hearing what said what colonel s motive very simple one use mr ferrars well well whatever colonel brandon may edward very lucky man mention matter fanny however though broke bears vastly well like hear much talked elinor some difficulty here refrain observing thought fanny might borne composure acquisition wealth brother which neither nor child possibly impoverished mrs ferrars added lowering his voice tone becoming important subject knows nothing present believe best keep entirely concealed long may when marriage takes place fear must hear all why should such precaution used though supposed mrs ferrars smallest satisfaction knowing son money enough live upon must quite question yet why upon late behaviour supposed feel all done son cast off ever made all those whom any influence cast off likewise surely after doing cannot imagined liable any impression sorrow joy his account cannot interested any thing befalls weak throw away comfort child yet retain anxiety parent ah elinor said john reasoning very good founded ignorance human nature when edward s unhappy match takes place depend upon his mother feel much if never discarded therefore every circumstance may accelerate dreadful event must concealed much possible mrs ferrars never forget edward son surprise should think must nearly escaped memory time wrong exceedingly mrs ferrars one most affectionate mothers world elinor silent think now said mr dashwood after short pause robert s marrying miss morton elinor smiling grave decisive importance brother s tone calmly replied lady suppose no choice affair choice how mean only mean suppose manner speaking must same miss morton whether marry edward robert certainly there no difference robert now all intents purposes considered eldest son any thing else both very agreeable young men know one superior other elinor said no more john also short time silent his reflections ended thus one thing dear sister kindly taking hand speaking awful whisper may assure because know must gratify good reason think indeed best authority should repeat otherwise very wrong say any thing very best authority ever precisely heard mrs ferrars say herself daughter short whatever objections there might against certain certain connection understand been far preferable given half vexation exceedingly pleased hear mrs ferrars considered light very gratifying circumstance know us all been beyond comparison said least evil two glad compound now nothing worse however all quite question thought mentioned any attachment know never all gone thought tell because knew how much must please any reason regret dear elinor there no doubt doing exceedingly well quite well better perhaps all things considered colonel brandon been lately elinor heard enough if gratify vanity raise self importance agitate nerves fill mind therefore glad spared necessity saying much reply herself danger hearing any thing more brother entrance mr robert ferrars after few moments chat john dashwood recollecting fanny yet uninformed sister s being there quitted room quest elinor left improve acquaintance robert who gay unconcern happy self complacency his manner while enjoying unfair division his mother s love liberality prejudice his banished brother earned only his own dissipated course life brother s integrity confirming most unfavourable opinion his head heart scarcely been two minutes themselves before began speak edward too heard living very inquisitive subject elinor repeated particulars given john effect robert though very different less striking been laughed most immoderately idea edward s being clergyman living small parsonage house diverted beyond measure when added fanciful imagery edward reading prayers white surplice publishing banns marriage between john smith mary brown conceive nothing more ridiculous elinor while waited silence immovable gravity conclusion such folly restrain eyes being fixed look spoke all contempt excited look however very well bestowed relieved own feelings gave no intelligence recalled wit wisdom any reproof hers his own sensibility may treat joke said last recovering affected laugh which considerably lengthened genuine gaiety moment upon soul most serious business poor edward ruined ever am extremely sorry know very good hearted creature well meaning fellow perhaps any world must judge miss dashwood slight acquaintance poor edward his manners certainly happiest nature all born know same powers same address poor fellow see circle strangers sure pitiable enough upon soul believe good heart any kingdom declare protest never shocked life when all burst forth believe mother first person who told feeling myself called act resolution

perplexity which no means lessening own conjectures unaccountable however circumstances his release might appear whole family certain edward free what purpose freedom employed easily pre determined all after experiencing blessings one imprudent engagement contracted without his mother s consent already done more four years nothing less expected failure immediate contraction another his errand barton fact simple one only ask elinor marry considering altogether inexperienced such question might strange should feel uncomfortable present case really much need encouragement fresh air how soon walked himself proper resolution however how soon opportunity exercising occurred what manner expressed himself how received need particularly told only need said when all sat table four o clock three

sedateness spirits any degree tranquillity heart edward now fixed cottage least week whatever other claims might made impossible less week should given enjoyment elinor s company suffice say half said past present future though very few hours spent hard labor incessant talking despatch more subjects really common between any two rational creatures yet lovers different between no subject finished no communication even made till been made least twenty times lucy s marriage unceasing reasonable wonder among all formed course one earliest discussions lovers elinor s particular knowledge each party made appear every view one most extraordinary unaccountable circumstances ever heard how thrown together what attraction robert drawn marry girl whose beauty herself heard speak without any admiration girl too already engaged his brother whose account brother been thrown off his family beyond comprehension make own heart delightful affair imagination even ridiculous one reason judgment completely puzzle edward only attempt explanation supposing perhaps first accidentally meeting vanity one been worked flattery other lead degrees all rest elinor remembered what robert told harley street his opinion what his own mediation his brother s affairs might done if applied time repeated edward exactly like robert his immediate observation presently added might perhaps his head when acquaintance between first began lucy perhaps first might think only procuring his good offices favour other designs might afterward arise how long been carrying between however equally loss herself make oxford where remained choice ever since his quitting london no means hearing herself letters very last neither less frequent nor less affectionate usual smallest suspicion therefore ever occurred prepare what followed when last burst letter lucy herself been some time believed half stupified between wonder horror joy such deliverance put letter elinor s hands dear sir being very sure long lost affections thought myself liberty bestow own another no doubt being happy once used think might scorn accept hand while heart another s sincerely wish happy choice shall fault if always good friends near relationship now makes proper safely say owe no ill am sure too generous us any ill offices brother gained affections entirely live without one another returned altar now way dawlish few weeks

pages writing believe may say since first half year foolish business only letter ever received which substance made any amends defect style however may come said elinor after pause certainly married mother brought herself most appropriate punishment independence settled robert through resentment against put his power make his own choice actually been bribing one son thousand year very deed which disinherited other intending hardly less hurt suppose robert s marrying lucy been marrying more hurt robert always favourite more hurt same principle forgive much sooner what state affair stood present between edward knew no communication any his family yet been attempted quitted oxford within four twenty hours after lucy s letter arrived only one object before nearest road barton no leisure form any scheme conduct which road hold most intimate connection nothing till assured his fate miss dashwood his rapidity seeking fate supposed spite jealousy which once thought colonel brandon spite modesty which rated his own deserts politeness which talked his doubts upon whole expect very cruel reception his business however say said very prettily what might say subject twelvemonth after must referred imagination husbands wives lucy certainly meant deceive go off flourish malice against message thomas perfectly clear elinor edward himself now thoroughly enlightened character no scruple believing capable utmost meanness wanton ill nature though his eyes been long opened even before his acquaintance elinor began ignorance want liberality some opinions been equally imputed want education till last letter reached always believed well disposed good hearted girl thoroughly attached himself nothing such persuasion prevented his putting end engagement which long before discovery laid open his mother s anger been continual source disquiet regret thought duty said independent feelings give option continuing engagement when renounced mother stood all appearance without friend world assist such situation where there seemed nothing tempt avarice vanity any living creature how suppose when earnestly warmly insisted sharing fate whatever might any thing most disinterested affection inducement even now cannot comprehend what motive acted what fancied advantage fettered man whom smallest regard who only two thousand pounds world foresee colonel brandon give living no might suppose something occur favour own family might time relent any rate lost nothing continuing engagement proved fettered neither inclination nor actions connection certainly respectable one probably gained consideration among friends if nothing more advantageous occurred better marry single edward course immediately convinced nothing been more natural lucy s conduct nor more self evident motive elinor scolded harshly ladies always scold imprudence which compliments themselves having spent much time norland when must felt his own inconstancy behaviour certainly very wrong said because say nothing own conviction relations all led away fancy expect what situated never only plead ignorance his own heart mistaken confidence force his engagement simple enough think because faith plighted another there no danger being consciousness engagement keep heart safe sacred honour felt admired told myself only friendship till began make comparisons between yourself lucy know how far got after suppose wrong remaining much sussex arguments which reconciled myself expediency no better these danger own am doing no injury anybody myself elinor smiled shook head edward heard pleasure colonel brandon s being expected cottage really wished only better acquainted opportunity convincing no longer resented his giving living delaford which present said after thanks ungraciously delivered mine occasion must think never forgiven offering now felt astonished himself never yet been place little interest taken matter owed all his knowledge house garden glebe extent parish condition land rate tithes elinor herself who heard much colonel brandon heard much attention entirely mistress subject one question after only remained undecided between one difficulty only overcome brought together mutual affection warmest approbation real friends intimate knowledge each other seemed make happiness certain only wanted something live upon edward two thousand pounds elinor one which delaford living all call own impossible mrs dashwood should advance anything neither quite enough love think three hundred fifty pounds year supply comforts life edward entirely without hopes some favourable change his mother towards rested residue income elinor no such dependence since edward still unable marry miss morton his chusing herself been spoken mrs ferrars s flattering language only lesser evil his chusing lucy steele feared robert s offence serve no other purpose enrich fanny four days after edward s arrival colonel brandon appeared complete mrs dashwood s satisfaction give dignity having first time since living barton more company house hold edward allowed retain privilege first comer colonel brandon therefore walked every night his old quarters park whence usually returned morning early enough interrupt lovers first t te t te before breakfast three weeks residence delaford where his evening hours least little calculate disproportion between thirty six seventeen brought barton temper mind which needed all improvement marianne s looks all kindness welcome all encouragement mother s language make cheerful among such friends however such flattery revive no rumour lucy s marriage yet reached knew nothing what passed first hours his visit consequently spent hearing wondering every thing explained mrs dashwood found fresh reason rejoice what done mr ferrars since eventually promoted interest elinor needless say gentlemen advanced good opinion each other advanced each other s acquaintance otherwise resemblance good principles good sense disposition manner thinking probably been sufficient unite friendship without any other attraction being love two sisters two sisters fond each other made mutual regard inevitable immediate which might otherwise waited effect time judgment letters town which few days before made every nerve elinor s body thrill transport now arrived read less emotion mirth mrs jennings wrote tell wonderful tale vent honest indignation against jilting girl pour forth compassion towards poor mr edward who sure quite doted upon worthless hussy now all accounts almost broken hearted oxford think continued nothing ever carried sly two days before lucy called sat couple hours soul suspected anything matter even nancy who poor soul came crying day after great fright fear mrs ferrars well knowing how get plymouth lucy seems borrowed all money before went off married purpose suppose make show poor nancy seven shillings world very glad give five guineas take exeter where thinks staying three four weeks mrs burgess hopes tell fall doctor again must say lucy s crossness take along chaise worse all poor mr edward cannot get head must send barton miss marianne must try comfort mr dashwood s strains more solemn mrs ferrars most unfortunate women poor fanny suffered agonies sensibility considered existence each such blow grateful wonder robert s offence unpardonable lucy s infinitely worse neither ever again mentioned mrs ferrars even if might hereafter induced forgive son his wife should never acknowledged daughter nor permitted appear presence secrecy which everything been carried between rationally treated enormously heightening crime because any suspicion occurred others proper measures been taken prevent marriage called elinor join regretting lucy s engagement edward rather been fulfilled should thus means spreading misery farther family thus continued mrs ferrars never yet mentioned edward s name which surprise us great astonishment line been received occasion perhaps however kept silent his fear offending shall therefore give hint line oxford his sister both think letter proper submission addressed perhaps fanny shown mother might taken amiss all know tenderness mrs ferrars s heart wishes nothing much good terms children paragraph some importance prospects conduct edward determined attempt reconciliation though exactly manner pointed brother sister letter proper submission repeated beg mother s pardon robert s ingratitude breach honour make no submission am grown neither humble nor penitent what passed am grown very happy interest know no submission proper make may certainly ask forgiven said elinor because offended should think might now venture far profess some concern having ever formed engagement which drew mother s anger agreed might when forgiven perhaps little humility may convenient while acknowledging second engagement almost imprudent eyes first nothing urge against still resisted idea letter proper submission therefore make easier declared much greater willingness make mean concessions word mouth paper resolved instead writing fanny should go london personally intreat good offices his favour if really interest themselves said marianne new character candour bringing reconciliation shall think even john fanny entirely without merit after visit colonel brandon s side only three four days two gentlemen quitted barton together go immediately delaford edward might some personal knowledge his future home assist his patron friend deciding what improvements needed thence after staying there couple nights proceed his journey town after proper resistance part mrs ferrars violent steady preserve reproach which always seemed fearful incurring reproach being too amiable edward admitted presence pronounced again son family late been exceedingly fluctuating many years life two sons crime annihilation edward few weeks ago robbed one similar annihilation robert left fortnight without any now resuscitation edward one again spite his being allowed once more live however feel continuance his existence secure till revealed his present engagement publication circumstance feared might give sudden turn his constitution carry off rapidly before apprehensive caution therefore revealed listened unexpected calmness mrs ferrars first reasonably endeavoured dissuade marrying miss dashwood every argument power told miss morton woman higher rank larger fortune enforced assertion observing miss morton daughter nobleman thirty thousand pounds while miss dashwood only daughter private gentleman no more three when found though perfectly admitting truth representation no means inclined guided judged wisest experience past submit therefore after such ungracious delay owed own dignity served prevent every suspicion good issued decree consent marriage edward elinor what engage towards augmenting income next considered here plainly appeared though edward now only son no means eldest while robert inevitably endowed thousand pounds year smallest objection made against edward s taking orders sake two hundred fifty utmost nor anything promised either present future beyond ten thousand pounds which been given fanny much however desired more expected edward elinor mrs ferrars herself shuffling excuses seemed only person surprised giving more income quite sufficient wants thus secured nothing wait after edward possession living readiness house which colonel brandon eager desire accommodation elinor making considerable improvements after waiting some time completion after experiencing usual thousand disappointments delays unaccountable dilatoriness workmen elinor usual broke through first positive resolution marrying till every thing ready ceremony took place barton church early autumn first

people much thrown together see little anybody else always power set off advantage forth short may well give chance understand though mrs ferrars come see always treated make believe decent affection never insulted real favour preference due folly robert cunning his wife earned before many months passed away selfish sagacity latter which first drawn robert scrape principal instrument his deliverance respectful humility assiduous attentions endless flatteries soon smallest opening given exercise reconciled mrs ferrars his choice re established completely favour whole lucy s behaviour affair prosperity which crowned therefore may held forth most encouraging instance what earnest unceasing attention self interest however its progress may apparently obstructed securing every advantage fortune no other sacrifice time conscience when robert first sought acquaintance privately visited bartlett s buildings only view imputed his brother merely meant persuade give engagement there nothing overcome affection both naturally expected one two interviews settle matter point however only erred though lucy soon gave hopes his eloquence convince time another visit another conversation always wanted produce conviction some doubts always lingered mind when parted which only removed another half hour s discourse himself his attendance means secured rest followed course instead talking edward came gradually talk only robert subject which always more say any other which soon betrayed interest even equal his own short became speedily evident both entirely supplanted his brother proud his conquest proud tricking edward very proud marrying privately without his mother s consent what immediately followed known passed some months great happiness dawlish many relations old acquaintances cut drew several plans magnificent cottages thence returning town procured forgiveness mrs ferrars simple expedient asking which lucy s instigation adopted forgiveness first indeed reasonable comprehended only robert lucy who owed his mother no duty therefore transgressed none still remained some weeks longer unpardoned perseverance humility conduct messages self condemnation robert s offence gratitude unkindness treated procured time haughty notice which overcame its graciousness led soon afterwards rapid degrees highest state affection influence lucy became necessary mrs ferrars either robert fanny while edward never cordially forgiven having once intended marry elinor though superior fortune birth spoken intruder every thing considered always openly acknowledged favourite child settled town received very liberal assistance mrs ferrars best terms imaginable dashwoods setting aside jealousies ill continually subsisting between fanny lucy which
