chapter i sir walter elliot kellynch hall somersetshire was man who for his own amusement never took up any book but baronetage there he found occupation for idle hour consolation distressed one there his faculties were roused into admiration respect by contemplating limited remnant earliest patents there any unwelcome sensations arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity contempt as he turned over almost endless creations last century there if every other leaf were powerless he could read his own history with interest which never failed this was page at which favourite volume always opened elliot kellynch hall walter elliot born march 1 1760 married july 15 1784 elizabeth daughter james stevenson esq south park county gloucester by which lady who died 1800 he has issue elizabeth born june 1 1785 anne born august 9 1787 still born son november 5 1789 mary born november 20 1791 precisely such had paragraph originally stood from printer s hands but sir walter had improved it by adding for information himself his family these words after date mary s birth married december 16 1810 charles son heir charles musgrove esq uppercross county somerset by inserting most accurately day month on which he had lost his wife then followed history rise ancient respectable family usual terms how it had been first settled cheshire how mentioned dugdale serving office high sheriff representing borough three successive parliaments exertions loyalty dignity baronet first year charles ii with all marys elizabeths they had married forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages concluding with arms motto principal seat kellynch hall county somerset sir walter s handwriting again this finale heir presumptive william walter elliot esq great grandson second sir walter vanity was beginning end sir walter elliot s character vanity person situation he had been remarkably handsome his youth at fifty four was still very fine man few women could think more their personal appearance than he did nor could valet any new made lord be more delighted with place he held society he considered blessing beauty as inferior only blessing baronetcy sir walter elliot who united these gifts was constant object his warmest respect devotion his good looks his rank had one fair claim on his attachment since them he must have owed wife very superior character any thing deserved by his own lady elliot had been excellent woman sensible amiable whose judgement conduct if they might be pardoned youthful infatuation which made her lady elliot had never required indulgence afterwards she had humoured or softened or concealed his failings promoted his real respectability for seventeen years though not very happiest being world herself had found enough her duties her friends her children attach her life make it no matter indifference her when she was called on quit them three girls two eldest sixteen fourteen was awful legacy for mother bequeath awful charge rather confide authority guidance conceited silly father she had however one very intimate friend sensible deserving woman who had been brought by strong attachment herself settle close by her village kellynch on her kindness advice lady elliot mainly relied for best help maintenance good principles instruction which she had been anxiously giving her daughters this friend sir walter did not marry whatever might have been anticipated on that head by their acquaintance thirteen years had passed away since lady elliot s death they were still near neighbours intimate friends one remained widower other widow that lady russell steady age character extremely well provided for should have no thought second marriage needs no apology public which is rather apt be unreasonably discontented when woman does marry again than when she does not but sir walter s continuing singleness requires explanation be it known then that sir walter like good father having met with one or two private disappointments very unreasonable applications prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters sake for one daughter his eldest he would really have given up any thing which he had not been very much tempted do elizabeth had succeeded at sixteen all that was possible her mother s rights consequence being very handsome very like himself her influence had always been great they had gone on together most happily his two other children were very inferior value mary had acquired little artificial importance by becoming mrs charles musgrove but anne with elegance mind sweetness character which must have placed her high with any people real understanding was nobody with either father or sister her word had no weight her convenience was always give way she was only anne lady russell indeed she was most dear highly valued god daughter favourite friend lady russell loved them all but it was only anne that she could fancy mother revive again few years before anne elliot had been very pretty girl but her bloom had vanished early as even its height her father had found little admire her so totally different were her delicate features mild dark eyes from his own there could be nothing them now that she was faded thin excite his esteem he had never indulged much hope he had now none ever reading her name any other page his favourite work all equality alliance must rest with elizabeth for mary had merely connected herself with old country family respectability large fortune had therefore given all honour received none elizabeth would one day or other marry suitably it sometimes happens that woman is handsomer at twenty nine than she was ten years before generally speaking if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety it is time life at which scarcely any charm is lost it was so with elizabeth still same handsome miss elliot that she had begun be thirteen years ago sir walter might be excused therefore forgetting her age or at least be deemed only half fool for thinking himself elizabeth as blooming as ever amidst wreck good looks everybody else for he could plainly see how old all rest his family acquaintance were growing anne haggard mary coarse every face neighbourhood worsting rapid increase crow s foot about lady russell s temples had long been distress him elizabeth did not quite equal her father personal contentment thirteen years had seen her mistress kellynch hall presiding directing with self possession decision which could never have given idea her being younger than she was for thirteen years had she been doing honours laying down domestic law at home leading way chaise four walking immediately after lady russell out all drawing rooms dining rooms country thirteen winters revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball credit which scanty neighbourhood afforded thirteen springs shewn their blossoms as she travelled up london with her father for few weeks annual enjoyment great world she had remembrance all this she had consciousness being nine twenty give her some regrets some apprehensions she was fully satisfied being still quite as handsome as ever but she felt her approach years danger would have rejoiced be certain being properly solicited by baronet blood within next twelvemonth or two then might she again take up book books with as much enjoyment as her early youth but now she liked it not always be presented with date her own birth see no marriage follow but that youngest sister made book evil more than once when her father had left it open on table near her had she closed it with averted eyes pushed it away she had had disappointment moreover which that book especially history her own family must ever present remembrance heir presumptive very william walter elliot esq whose rights had been so generously supported by her father had disappointed her she had while very young girl as soon as she had known him be event her having no brother future baronet meant marry him her father had always meant that she should he had not been known them as boy but soon after lady elliot s death sir walter had sought acquaintance though his overtures had not been met with any warmth he had persevered seeking it making allowance for modest drawing back youth one their spring excursions london when elizabeth was her first bloom mr elliot had been forced into introduction he was at that time very young man just engaged study law elizabeth found him extremely agreeable every plan his favour was confirmed he was invited kellynch hall he was talked expected all rest year but he never came following spring he was seen again town found equally agreeable again encouraged invited expected again he did not come next tidings were that he was married instead pushing his fortune line marked out for heir house elliot he had purchased independence by uniting himself rich woman inferior birth sir walter had resented it as head house he felt that he ought have been consulted especially after taking young man so publicly by hand for they must have been seen together he observed once at tattersall s twice lobby house commons his disapprobation was expressed but apparently very little regarded mr elliot had attempted no apology shewn himself as unsolicitous being longer noticed by family as sir walter considered him unworthy it all acquaintance between them had ceased this very awkward history mr elliot was still after interval several years felt with anger by elizabeth who had liked man for himself still more for being her father s heir whose strong family pride could see only him proper match for sir walter elliot s eldest daughter there was not baronet from z whom her feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as equal yet so miserably had he conducted himself that though she was at this present time summer 1814 wearing black ribbons for his wife she could not admit him be worth thinking again disgrace his first marriage might perhaps as there was no reason suppose it perpetuated by offspring have been got over had he not done worse but he had as by accustomary intervention kind friends they had been informed spoken most disrespectfully them all most slightingly contemptuously very blood he belonged honours which were hereafter be his own this could not be pardoned such were elizabeth elliot s sentiments sensations such cares alloy agitations vary sameness elegance prosperity nothingness her scene life such feelings give interest long uneventful residence one country circle fill vacancies which there were no habits utility abroad no talents or accomplishments for home occupy but now another occupation solicitude mind was beginning be added these her father was growing distressed for money she knew that when he now took up baronetage it was drive heavy bills his tradespeople unwelcome hints mr shepherd his agent from his thoughts kellynch property was good but not equal sir walter s apprehension state required its possessor while lady elliot lived there had been method moderation economy which had just kept him within his income but with her had died all such right mindedness from that period he had been constantly exceeding it it had not been possible for him spend less he had done nothing but what sir walter elliot was imperiously called on do but blameless as he was he was not only growing dreadfully debt but was hearing it so often that it became vain attempt concealing it longer even partially from his daughter he had given her some hints it last spring town he had gone so far even as say can we retrench does it occur you that there is any one article which we can retrench elizabeth do her justice had first ardour female alarm set seriously think what could be done had finally proposed these two branches economy cut off some unnecessary charities refrain from new furnishing drawing room which expedients she afterwards added happy thought their taking no present down anne as had been usual yearly custom but these measures however good themselves were insufficient for real extent evil whole which sir walter found himself obliged confess her soon afterwards elizabeth had nothing propose deeper efficacy she felt herself ill used unfortunate as did her father they were neither them able devise any means lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity or relinquishing their comforts way not be borne there was only small part his estate that sir walter could dispose but had every acre been alienable it would have made no difference he had condescended mortgage as far as he had power but he would never condescend sell no he would never disgrace his name so far kellynch estate should be transmitted whole entire as he had received it their two confidential friends mr shepherd who lived neighbouring market town lady russell were called on advise them both father daughter seemed expect that something should be struck out by one or other remove their embarrassments reduce their expenditure without involving loss any indulgence taste or pride chapter ii mr shepherd civil cautious lawyer who whatever might be his hold or his views on sir walter would rather have disagreeable prompted by anybody else excused himself from offering slightest hint only begged leave recommend implicit reference excellent judgement lady russell from whose known good sense he fully expected have just such resolute measures advised as he meant see finally adopted lady russell was most anxiously zealous on subject gave it much serious consideration she was woman rather sound than quick abilities whose difficulties coming any decision this instance were great from opposition two leading principles she was strict integrity herself with delicate sense honour but she was as desirous saving sir walter s feelings as solicitous for credit family as aristocratic her ideas what was due them as anybody sense honesty could well be she was benevolent charitable good woman capable strong attachments most correct her conduct strict her notions decorum with manners that were held standard good breeding she had cultivated mind was generally speaking rational consistent but she had prejudices on side ancestry she had value for rank consequence which blinded her little faults those who possessed them herself widow only knight she gave dignity baronet all its due sir walter independent his claims as old acquaintance attentive neighbour obliging landlord husband her very dear friend father anne her sisters was as being sir walter her apprehension entitled great deal compassion consideration under his present difficulties they must retrench that did not admit doubt but she was very anxious have it done with least possible pain him elizabeth she drew up plans economy she made exact calculations she did what nobody else thought doing she consulted anne who never seemed considered by others as having any interest question she consulted degree was influenced by her marking out scheme retrenchment which was at last submitted sir walter every emendation anne s had been on side honesty against importance she wanted more vigorous measures more complete reformation quicker release from debt much higher tone indifference for everything but justice equity if we can persuade your father all this said lady russell looking over her paper much may be done if he will adopt these regulations seven years he will be clear i hope we may be able convince him elizabeth that kellynch hall has respectability itself which cannot be affected by these reductions that true dignity sir walter elliot will be very far from lessened eyes sensible people by acting like man principle what will he be doing fact but what very many our first families have done or ought do there will be nothing singular his case it is singularity which often makes worst part our suffering as it always does our conduct i have great hope prevailing we must be serious decided for after all person who has contracted debts must pay them though great deal is due feelings gentleman head house like your father there is still more due character honest man this was principle on which anne wanted her father be proceeding his friends be urging him she considered it as act indispensable duty clear away claims creditors with all expedition which most comprehensive retrenchments could secure saw no dignity anything short it she wanted it be prescribed felt as duty she rated lady russell s influence highly as severe degree self denial which her own conscience prompted she believed there might be little more difficulty persuading them complete than half reformation her knowledge her father elizabeth inclined her think that sacrifice one pair horses would be hardly less painful than both so on through whole list lady russell s too gentle reductions how anne s more rigid requisitions might have been taken is little consequence lady russell s had no success at all could not be put up with were not be borne what every comfort life knocked off journeys london servants horses table contractions restrictions every where live no longer with decencies even private gentleman no he would sooner quit kellynch hall at once than remain it on such disgraceful terms quit kellynch hall hint was immediately taken up by mr shepherd whose interest was involved reality sir walter s retrenching who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without change abode since idea had been started very quarter which ought dictate he had no scruple he said confessing his judgement be entirely on that side it did not appear him that sir walter could materially alter his style living house which had such character hospitality ancient dignity support any other place sir walter might judge for himself would be looked up as regulating modes life whatever way he might choose model his household sir walter would quit kellynch hall after very few days more doubt indecision great question whither he should go was settled first outline this important change made out there had been three alternatives london bath or another house country all anne s wishes had been for latter small house their own neighbourhood where they might still have lady russell s society still be near mary still have pleasure sometimes seeing lawns groves kellynch was object her ambition but usual fate anne attended her having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on she disliked bath did not think it agreed with her bath was be her home sir walter had at first thought more london but mr shepherd felt that he could not be trusted london had been skilful enough dissuade him from it make bath preferred it was much safer place for gentleman his predicament he might there be important at comparatively little expense two material advantages bath over london had course been given all their weight its more convenient distance from kellynch only fifty miles lady russell s spending some part every winter there very great satisfaction lady russell whose first views on projected change had been for bath sir walter elizabeth were induced believe that they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there lady russell felt obliged oppose her dear anne s known wishes it would be too much expect sir walter descend into small house his own neighbourhood anne herself would have found mortifications it more than she foresaw sir walter s feelings they must have been dreadful with regard anne s dislike bath she considered it as prejudice mistake arising first from circumstance her having been three years at school there after her mother s death secondly from her happening be not perfectly good spirits only winter which she had afterwards spent there with herself lady russell was fond bath short disposed think it must suit them all as her young friend s health by passing all warm months with her at kellynch lodge every danger would be avoided it was fact change which must do both health spirits good anne had been too little from home too little seen her spirits were not high larger society would improve them she wanted her be more known undesirableness any other house same neighbourhood for sir walter was certainly much strengthened by one part very material part scheme which had been happily engrafted on beginning he was not only quit his home but see it hands others trial fortitude which stronger heads than sir walter s have found too much kellynch hall was be let this however was profound secret not be breathed beyond their own circle sir walter could not have borne degradation being known design letting his house mr shepherd had once mentioned word advertise but never dared approach it again sir walter spurned idea its being offered any manner forbad slightest hint being dropped his having such intention it was only on supposition his being spontaneously solicited by some most unexceptionable applicant on his own terms as great favour that he would let it at all how quick come reasons for approving what we like lady russell had another excellent one at hand for being extremely glad that sir walter his family were remove from country elizabeth had been lately forming intimacy which she wished see interrupted it was with daughter mr shepherd who had returned after unprosperous marriage her father s house with additional burden two children she was clever young woman who understood art pleasing art pleasing at least at kellynch hall who had made herself so acceptable miss elliot as have been already staying there more than once spite all that lady russell who thought it friendship quite out place could hint caution reserve lady russell indeed had scarcely any influence with elizabeth seemed love her rather because she would love her than because elizabeth deserved it she had never received from her more than outward attention nothing beyond observances complaisance had never succeeded any point which she wanted carry against previous inclination she had been repeatedly very earnest trying get anne included visit london sensibly open all injustice all discredit selfish arrangements which shut her out on many lesser occasions had endeavoured give elizabeth advantage her own better judgement experience but always vain elizabeth would go her own way never had she pursued it more decided opposition lady russell than this selection mrs clay turning from society so deserving sister bestow her affection confidence on one who ought have been nothing her but object distant civility from situation mrs clay was lady russell s estimate very unequal her character she believed very dangerous companion removal that would leave mrs clay behind bring choice more suitable intimates within miss elliot s reach was therefore object first rate importance chapter iii i must take leave observe sir walter said mr shepherd one morning at kellynch hall as he laid down newspaper that present juncture is much our favour this peace will be turning all our rich naval officers ashore they will be all wanting home could not be better time sir walter for having choice tenants very responsible tenants many noble fortune has been made during war if rich admiral were come our way sir walter he would be very lucky man shepherd replied sir walter that s all i have remark prize indeed would kellynch hall be him rather greatest prize all let him have taken ever so many before hey shepherd mr shepherd laughed as he knew he must at this wit then added i presume observe sir walter that way business gentlemen navy are well deal with i have had little knowledge their methods doing business i am free confess that they have very liberal notions are as likely make desirable tenants as any set people one should meet with therefore sir walter what i would take leave suggest is that if consequence any rumours getting abroad your intention which must be contemplated as possible thing because we know how difficult it is keep actions designs one part world from notice curiosity other consequence has its tax i john shepherd might conceal any family matters that i chose for nobody would think it worth their while observe me but sir walter elliot has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult elude therefore thus much i venture upon that it will not greatly surprise me if with all our caution some rumour truth should get abroad supposition which as i was going observe since applications will unquestionably follow i should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending beg leave add that two hours will bring me over at any time save you trouble replying sir walter only nodded but soon afterwards rising pacing room he observed sarcastically there are few among gentlemen navy i imagine who would not be surprised find themselves house this description they would look around them no doubt bless their good fortune said mrs clay for mrs clay was present her father had driven her over nothing being so much use mrs clay s health as drive kellynch but i quite agree with my father thinking sailor might be very desirable tenant i have known good deal profession besides their liberality they are so neat careful all their ways these valuable pictures yours sir walter if you chose leave them would be perfectly safe everything about house would be taken such excellent care gardens shrubberies would be kept almost as high order as they are now you need not be afraid miss elliot your own sweet flower gardens being neglected as all that rejoined sir walter coolly supposing i were induced let my house i have by no means made up my mind as privileges be annexed it i am not particularly disposed favour tenant park would be open him course few navy officers or men any other description can have had such range but what restrictions i might impose on use pleasure grounds is another thing i am not fond idea my shrubberies being always approachable i should recommend miss elliot be on her guard with respect her flower garden i am very little disposed grant tenant kellynch hall any extraordinary favour i assure you be he sailor or soldier after short pause mr shepherd presumed say all these cases there are established usages which make everything plain easy between landlord tenant your interest sir walter is pretty safe hands depend upon me for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights i venture hint that sir walter elliot cannot be half so jealous for his own as john shepherd will be for him here anne spoke navy i think who have done so much for us have at least equal claim with any other set men for all comforts all privileges which any home can give sailors work hard enough for their comforts we must all allow very true very true what miss anne says is very true was mr shepherd s rejoinder oh certainly was his daughter s but sir walter s remark was soon afterwards profession has its utility but i should be sorry see any friend mine belonging it indeed was reply with look surprise yes it is two points offensive me i have two strong grounds objection it first as being means bringing persons obscure birth into undue distinction raising men honours which their fathers grandfathers never dreamt secondly as it cuts up man s youth vigour most horribly sailor grows old sooner than any other man i have observed it all my life man is greater danger navy being insulted by rise one whose father his father might have disdained speak becoming prematurely object disgust himself than any other line one day last spring town i was company with two men striking instances what i am talking lord st ives whose father we all know have been country curate without bread eat i was give place lord st ives certain admiral baldwin most deplorable looking personage you can imagine his face colour mahogany rough rugged last degree all lines wrinkles nine grey hairs side nothing but dab powder at top name heaven who is that old fellow said i friend mine who was standing near sir basil morley old fellow cried sir basil it is admiral baldwin what do you take his age be sixty said i or perhaps sixty two forty replied sir basil forty no more picture yourselves my amazement i shall not easily forget admiral baldwin i never saw quite so wretched example what sea faring life can do but degree i know it is same with them all they are all knocked about exposed every climate every weather till they are not fit be seen it is pity they are not knocked on head at once before they reach admiral baldwin s age nay sir walter cried mrs clay this is being severe indeed have little mercy on poor men we are not all born be handsome sea is no beautifier certainly sailors do grow old betimes i have observed it they soon lose look youth but then is not it same with many other professions perhaps most other soldiers active service are not at all better off even quieter professions there is toil labour mind if not body which seldom leaves man s looks natural effect time lawyer plods quite care worn physician is up at all hours travelling all weather even clergyman she stopt moment consider what might do for clergyman even clergyman you know is obliged go into infected rooms expose his health looks all injury poisonous atmosphere fact as i have long been convinced though every profession is necessary honourable its turn it is only lot those who are not obliged follow any who can live regular way country choosing their own hours following their own pursuits living on their own property without torment trying for more it is only their lot i say hold blessings health good appearance utmost i know no other set men but what lose something their personableness when they cease be quite young it seemed as if mr shepherd this anxiety bespeak sir walter s good will towards naval officer as tenant had been gifted with foresight for very first application for house was from admiral croft with whom he shortly afterwards fell into company attending quarter sessions at taunton indeed he had received hint admiral from london correspondent by report which he hastened over kellynch make admiral croft was native somersetshire who having acquired very handsome fortune was wishing settle his own country had come down taunton order look at some advertised places that immediate neighbourhood which however had not suited him that accidentally hearing it was just as he had foretold mr shepherd observed sir walter s concerns could not be kept secret accidentally hearing possibility kellynch hall being let understanding his mr shepherd s connection with owner he had introduced himself him order make particular inquiries had course pretty long conference expressed as strong inclination for place as man who knew it only by description could feel given mr shepherd his explicit account himself every proof his being most responsible eligible tenant who is admiral croft was sir walter s cold suspicious inquiry mr shepherd answered for his being gentleman s family mentioned place anne after little pause which followed added he is rear admiral white he was trafalgar action has been east indies since he was stationed there i believe several years then i take it for granted observed sir walter that his face is about as orange as cuffs capes my livery mr shepherd hastened assure him that admiral croft was very hale hearty well looking man little weather beaten be sure but not much quite gentleman all his notions behaviour not likely make smallest difficulty about terms only wanted comfortable home get into it as soon as possible knew he must pay for his convenience knew what rent ready furnished house that consequence might fetch should not have been surprised if sir walter had asked more had inquired about manor would be glad deputation certainly but made no great point it said he sometimes took out gun but never killed quite gentleman mr shepherd was eloquent on subject pointing out all circumstances admiral s family which made him peculiarly desirable as tenant he was married man without children very state be wished for house was never taken good care mr shepherd observed without lady he did not know whether furniture might not be danger suffering as much where there was no lady as where there were many children lady without family was very best preserver furniture world he had seen mrs croft too she was at taunton with admiral had been present almost all time they were talking matter over very well spoken genteel shrewd lady she seemed be continued he asked more questions about house terms taxes than admiral himself seemed more conversant with business moreover sir walter i found she was not quite unconnected this country any more than her husband that is say she is sister gentleman who did live amongst us once she told me so herself sister gentleman who lived few years back at monkford bless me what was his name at this moment i cannot recollect his name though i have heard it so lately penelope my dear can you help me name gentleman who lived at monkford mrs croft s brother but mrs clay was talking so eagerly with miss elliot that she did not hear appeal i have no conception whom you can mean shepherd i remember no gentleman resident at monkford since time old governor trent bless me how very odd i shall forget my own name soon i suppose name that i am so very well acquainted with knew gentleman so well by sight seen him hundred times came consult me once i remember about trespass one his neighbours farmer s man breaking into his orchard wall torn down apples stolen caught fact afterwards contrary my judgement submitted amicable compromise very odd indeed after waiting another moment you mean mr wentworth i suppose said anne mr shepherd was all gratitude wentworth was very name mr wentworth was very man he had curacy monkford you know sir walter some time back for two or three years came there about year 5 i take it you remember him i am sure wentworth oh ay mr wentworth curate monkford you misled me by term gentleman i thought you were speaking some man property mr wentworth was nobody i remember quite unconnected nothing do with strafford family one wonders how names many our nobility become so common as mr shepherd perceived that this connexion crofts did them no service with sir walter he mentioned it no more returning with all his zeal dwell on circumstances more indisputably their favour their age number fortune high idea they had formed kellynch hall extreme solicitude for advantage renting it making it appear as if they ranked nothing beyond happiness being tenants sir walter elliot extraordinary taste certainly could they have been supposed secret sir walter s estimate dues tenant it succeeded however though sir walter must ever look with evil eye on anyone intending inhabit that house think them infinitely too well off being permitted rent it on highest terms he was talked into allowing mr shepherd proceed treaty authorising him wait on admiral croft who still remained at taunton fix day for house being seen sir walter was not very wise but still he had experience enough world feel that more unobjectionable tenant all essentials than admiral croft bid fair be could hardly offer so far went his understanding his vanity supplied little additional soothing admiral s situation life which was just high enough not too high i have let my house admiral croft would sound extremely well very much better than any mere mr mr save perhaps some half dozen nation always needs note explanation admiral speaks his own consequence at same time can never make baronet look small all their dealings intercourse sir walter elliot must ever have precedence nothing could be done without reference elizabeth but her inclination was growing so strong for removal that she was happy have it fixed expedited by tenant at hand not word suspend decision was uttered by her mr shepherd was completely empowered act no sooner had such end been reached than anne who had been most attentive listener whole left room seek comfort cool air for her flushed cheeks as she walked along favourite grove said with gentle sigh few months more he perhaps may be walking here chapter iv he was not mr wentworth former curate monkford however suspicious appearances may be but captain frederick wentworth his brother who being made commander consequence action off st domingo not immediately employed had come into somersetshire summer 1806 having no parent living found home for half year at monkford he was at that time remarkably fine young man with great deal intelligence spirit brilliancy anne extremely pretty girl with gentleness modesty taste feeling half sum attraction on either side might have been enough for he had nothing do she had hardly anybody love but encounter such lavish recommendations could not fail they were gradually acquainted when acquainted rapidly deeply love it would be difficult say which had seen highest perfection other or which had been happiest she receiving his declarations proposals or he having them accepted short period exquisite felicity followed but short one troubles soon arose sir walter on being applied without actually withholding his consent or saying it should never be gave it all negative great astonishment great coldness great silence professed resolution doing nothing for his daughter he thought it very degrading alliance lady russell though with more tempered pardonable pride received it as most unfortunate one anne elliot with all her claims birth beauty mind throw herself away at nineteen involve herself at nineteen engagement with young man who had nothing but himself recommend him no hopes attaining affluence but chances most uncertain profession no connexions secure even his farther rise profession would be indeed throwing away which she grieved think anne elliot so young known so few be snatched off by stranger without alliance or fortune or rather sunk by him into state most wearing anxious youth killing dependence it must not be if by any fair interference friendship any representations from one who had almost mother s love mother s rights it would be prevented captain wentworth had no fortune he had been lucky his profession but spending freely what had come freely had realized nothing but he was confident that he should soon be rich full life ardour he knew that he should soon have ship soon be on station that would lead everything he wanted he had always been lucky he knew he should be so still such confidence powerful its own warmth bewitching wit which often expressed it must have been enough for anne but lady russell saw it very differently his sanguine temper fearlessness mind operated very differently on her she saw it but aggravation evil it only added dangerous character himself he was brilliant he was headstrong lady russell had little taste for wit anything approaching imprudence horror she deprecated connexion every light such opposition as these feelings produced was more than anne could combat young gentle as she was it might yet have been possible withstand her father s ill will though unsoftened by one kind word or look on part her sister but lady russell whom she had always loved relied on could not with such steadiness opinion such tenderness manner be continually advising her vain she was persuaded believe engagement wrong thing indiscreet improper hardly capable success not deserving it but it was not merely selfish caution under which she acted putting end it had she not imagined herself consulting his good even more than her own she could hardly have given him up belief being prudent self denying principally for his advantage was her chief consolation under misery parting final parting every consolation was required for she had encounter all additional pain opinions on his side totally unconvinced unbending his feeling himself ill used by so forced relinquishment he had left country consequence few months had seen beginning end their acquaintance but not with few months ended anne s share suffering from it her attachment regrets had for long time clouded every enjoyment youth early loss bloom spirits had been their lasting effect more than seven years were gone since this little history sorrowful interest had reached its close time had softened down much perhaps nearly all peculiar attachment him but she had been too dependent on time alone no aid had been given change place except one visit bath soon after rupture or any novelty or enlargement society no one had ever come within kellynch circle who could bear comparison with frederick wentworth as he stood her memory no second attachment only thoroughly natural happy sufficient cure at her time life had been possible nice tone her mind fastidiousness her taste small limits society around them she had been solicited when about two twenty change her name by young man who not long afterwards found more willing mind her younger sister lady russell had lamented her refusal for charles musgrove was eldest son man whose landed property general importance were second that country only sir walter s good character appearance however lady russell might have asked yet for something more while anne was nineteen she would have rejoiced see her at twenty two so respectably removed from partialities injustice her father s house settled so permanently near herself but this case anne had left nothing for advice do though lady russell as satisfied as ever with her own discretion never wished past undone she began now have anxiety which borders on hopelessness for anne s being tempted by some man talents independence enter state for which she held her be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections domestic habits they knew not each other s opinion either its constancy or its change on one leading point anne s conduct for subject was never alluded but anne at seven twenty thought very differently from what she had been made think at nineteen she did not blame lady russell she did not blame herself for having been guided by her but she felt that were any young person similar circumstances apply her for counsel they would never receive any such certain immediate wretchedness such uncertain future good she was persuaded that under every disadvantage disapprobation at home every anxiety attending his profession all their probable fears delays disappointments she should yet have been happier woman maintaining engagement than she had been sacrifice it this she fully believed had usual share had even more than usual share all such solicitudes suspense been theirs without reference actual results their case which as it happened would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could be reasonably calculated on all his sanguine expectations all his confidence had been justified his genius ardour had seemed foresee command his prosperous path he had very soon after their engagement ceased got employ all that he had told her would follow had taken place he had distinguished himself early gained other step rank must now by successive captures have made handsome fortune she had only navy lists newspapers for her authority but she could not doubt his being rich favour his constancy she had no reason believe him married how eloquent could anne elliot have been how eloquent at least were her wishes on side early warm attachment cheerful confidence futurity against that over anxious caution which seems insult exertion distrust providence she had been forced into prudence her youth she learned romance as she grew older natural sequel unnatural beginning with all these circumstances recollections feelings she could not hear that captain wentworth s sister was likely live at kellynch without revival former pain many stroll many sigh were necessary dispel agitation idea she often told herself it was folly before she could harden her nerves sufficiently feel continual discussion crofts their business no evil she was assisted however by that perfect indifference apparent unconsciousness among only three her own friends secret past which seemed almost deny any recollection it she could do justice superiority lady russell s motives this over those her father elizabeth she could honour all better feelings her calmness but general air oblivion among them was highly important from whatever it sprung event admiral croft s really taking kellynch hall she rejoiced anew over conviction which had always been most grateful her past being known those three only among her connexions by whom no syllable she believed would ever be whispered trust that among his brother only with whom he had been residing had received any information their short lived engagement that brother had been long removed from country being sensible man moreover single man at time she had fond dependence on no human creature s having heard it from him sister mrs croft had then been out england accompanying her husband on foreign station her own sister mary had been at school while it all occurred never admitted by pride some delicacy others smallest knowledge it afterwards with these supports she hoped that acquaintance between herself crofts which with lady russell still resident kellynch mary fixed only three miles off must be anticipated need not involve any particular awkwardness chapter v on morning appointed for admiral mrs croft s seeing kellynch hall anne found it most natural take her almost daily walk lady russell s keep out way till all was over when she found it most natural be sorry that she had missed opportunity seeing them this meeting two parties proved highly satisfactory decided whole business at once each lady was previously well disposed for agreement saw nothing therefore but good manners other with regard gentlemen there was such hearty good humour such open trusting liberality on admiral s side as could not but influence sir walter who had besides been flattered into his very best most polished behaviour by mr shepherd s assurances his being known by report admiral as model good breeding house grounds furniture were approved crofts were approved terms time every thing every body was right mr shepherd s clerks were set work without there having been single preliminary difference modify all that this indenture sheweth sir walter without hesitation declared admiral be best looking sailor he had ever met with went so far as say that if his own man might have had arranging his hair he should not be ashamed being seen with him any where admiral with sympathetic cordiality observed his wife as they drove back through park i thought we should soon come deal my dear spite what they told us at taunton baronet will never set thames on fire but there seems be no harm him reciprocal compliments which would have been esteemed about equal crofts were have possession at michaelmas as sir walter proposed removing bath course preceding month there was no time be lost making every dependent arrangement lady russell convinced that anne would not be allowed be any use or any importance choice house which they were going secure was very unwilling have her hurried away so soon wanted make it possible for her stay behind till she might convey her bath herself after christmas but having engagements her own which must take her from kellynch for several weeks she was unable give full invitation she wished anne though dreading possible heats september all white glare bath grieving forego all influence so sweet so sad autumnal months country did not think that everything considered she wished remain it would be most right most wise therefore must involve least suffering go with others something occurred however give her different duty mary often little unwell always thinking great deal her own complaints always habit claiming anne when anything was matter was indisposed foreseeing that she should not have day s health all autumn entreated or rather required her for it was hardly entreaty come uppercross cottage bear her company as long as she should want her instead going bath i cannot possibly do without anne was mary s reasoning elizabeth s reply was then i am sure anne had better stay for nobody will want her bath be claimed as good though improper style is at least better than being rejected as no good at all anne glad be thought some use glad have anything marked out as duty certainly not sorry have scene it country her own dear country readily agreed stay this invitation mary s removed all lady russell s difficulties it was consequently soon settled that anne should not go bath till lady russell took her that all intervening time should be divided between uppercross cottage kellynch lodge so far all was perfectly right but lady russell was almost startled by wrong one part kellynch hall plan when it burst on her which was mrs clay s being engaged go bath with sir walter elizabeth as most important valuable assistant latter all business before her lady russell was extremely sorry that such measure should have been resorted at all wondered grieved feared affront it contained anne mrs clay s being so much use while anne could be none was very sore aggravation anne herself was become hardened such affronts but she felt imprudence arrangement quite as keenly as lady russell with great deal quiet observation knowledge which she often wished less her father s character she was sensible that results most serious his family from intimacy were more than possible she did not imagine that her father had at present idea kind mrs clay had freckles projecting tooth clumsy wrist which he was continually making severe remarks upon her absence but she was young certainly altogether well looking possessed acute mind assiduous pleasing manners infinitely more dangerous attractions than any merely personal might have been anne was so impressed by degree their danger that she could not excuse herself from trying make it perceptible her sister she had little hope success but elizabeth who event such reverse would be so much more be pitied than herself should never she thought have reason reproach her for giving no warning she spoke seemed only offend elizabeth could not conceive how such absurd suspicion should occur her indignantly answered for each party s perfectly knowing their situation mrs clay said she warmly never forgets who she is as i am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be i can assure you that upon subject marriage they are particularly nice that she reprobates all inequality condition rank more strongly than most people as my father i really should not have thought that he who has kept himself single so long for our sakes need be suspected now if mrs clay were very beautiful woman i grant you it might be wrong have her so much with me not that anything world i am sure would induce my father make degrading match but he might be rendered unhappy but poor mrs clay who with all her merits can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty i really think poor mrs clay may be staying here perfect safety one would imagine you had never heard my father speak her personal misfortunes though i know you must fifty times that tooth hers those freckles freckles do not disgust me so very much as they do him i have known face not materially disfigured by few but he abominates them you must have heard him notice mrs clay s freckles there is hardly any personal defect replied anne which agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one i think very differently answered elizabeth shortly agreeable manner may set off handsome features but can never alter plain ones however at any rate as i have great deal more at stake on this point than anybody else can have i think it rather unnecessary you be advising me anne had done glad that it was over not absolutely hopeless doing good elizabeth though resenting suspicion might yet be made observant by it last office four carriage horses was draw sir walter miss elliot mrs clay bath party drove off very good spirits sir walter prepared with condescending bows for all afflicted tenantry cottagers who might have had hint show themselves anne walked up at same time sort desolate tranquillity lodge where she was spend first week her friend was not better spirits than herself lady russell felt this break up family exceedingly their respectability was as dear her as her own daily intercourse had become precious by habit it was painful look upon their deserted grounds still worse anticipate new hands they were fall into escape solitariness melancholy so altered village be out way when admiral mrs croft first arrived she had determined make her own absence from home begin when she must give up anne accordingly their removal was made together anne was set down at uppercross cottage first stage lady russell s journey uppercross was moderate sized village which few years back had been completely old english style containing only two houses superior appearance those yeomen labourers mansion squire with its high walls great gates old trees substantial unmodernized compact tight parsonage enclosed its own neat garden with vine pear tree trained round its casements but upon marriage young squire it had received improvement farm house elevated into cottage for his residence uppercross cottage with its veranda french windows other prettiness was quite as likely catch traveller s eye as more consistent considerable aspect premises great house about quarter mile farther on here anne had often been staying she knew ways uppercross as well as those kellynch two families were so continually meeting so much habit running out each other s house at all hours that it was rather surprise her find mary alone but being alone her being unwell out spirits was almost matter course though better endowed than elder sister mary had not anne s understanding nor temper while well happy properly attended she had great good humour excellent spirits but any indisposition sunk her completely she had no resources for solitude inheriting considerable share elliot self importance was very prone add every other distress that fancying herself neglected ill used person she was inferior both sisters had even her bloom only reached dignity being fine girl she was now lying on faded sofa pretty little drawing room once elegant furniture which had been gradually growing shabby under influence four summers two children on anne s appearing greeted her with so you are come at last i began think i should never see you i am so ill i can hardly speak i have not seen creature whole morning i am sorry find you unwell replied anne you sent me such good account yourself on thursday yes i made best it i always do but i was very far from well at time i do not think i ever was so ill my life as i have been all this morning very unfit be left alone i am sure suppose i were be seized sudden some dreadful way not able ring bell so lady russell would not get out i do not think she has been this house three times this summer anne said what was proper enquired after her husband oh charles is out shooting i have not seen him since seven o clock he would go though i told him how ill i was he said he should not stay out long but he has never come back now it is almost one i assure you i have not seen soul this whole long morning you have had your little boys with you yes as long as i could bear their noise but they are so unmanageable that they do me more harm than good little charles does not mind word i say walter is growing quite as bad well you will soon be better now replied anne cheerfully you know i always cure you when i come how are your neighbours at great house i can give you no account them i have not seen one them day except mr musgrove who just stopped spoke through window but without getting off his horse though i told him how ill i was not one them have been near me it did not happen suit miss musgroves i suppose they never put themselves out their way you will see them yet perhaps before morning is gone it is early i never want them i assure you they talk laugh great deal too much for me oh anne i am so very unwell it was quite unkind you not come on thursday my dear mary recollect what comfortable account you sent me yourself you wrote cheerfullest manner said you were perfectly well no hurry for me that being case you must be aware that my wish would be remain with lady russell last besides what i felt on her account i have really been so busy have had so much do that i could not very conveniently have left kellynch sooner dear me what can you possibly have do great many things i assure you more than i can recollect moment but i can tell you some i have been making duplicate catalogue my father s books pictures i have been several times garden with mackenzie trying understand make him understand which elizabeth s plants are for lady russell i have had all my own little concerns arrange books music divide all my trunks repack from not having understood time what was intended as waggons one thing i have had do mary more trying nature going almost every house parish as sort take leave i was told that they wished it but all these things took up great deal time oh well after moment s pause but you have never asked me one word about our dinner at pooles yesterday did you go then i have made no enquiries because i concluded you must have been obliged give up party oh yes i went i was very well yesterday nothing at all matter with me till this morning it would have been strange if i had not gone i am very glad you were well enough i hope you had pleasant party nothing remarkable one always knows beforehand what dinner will be who will be there it is so very uncomfortable not having carriage one s own mr mrs musgrove took me we were so crowded they are both so very large take up so much room mr musgrove always sits forward so there was i crowded into back seat with henrietta louisa i think it very likely that my illness day may be owing it little further perseverance patience forced cheerfulness on anne s side produced nearly cure on mary s she could soon sit upright on sofa began hope she might be able leave it by dinner time then forgetting think it she was at other end room beautifying nosegay then she ate her cold meat then she was well enough propose little walk where shall we go said she when they were ready i suppose you will not like call at great house before they have been see you i have not smallest objection on that account replied anne i should never think standing on such ceremony with people i know so well as mrs miss musgroves oh but they ought call upon you as soon as possible they ought feel what is due you as my sister however we may as well go sit with them little while when we have that over we can enjoy our walk anne had always thought such style intercourse highly imprudent but she had ceased endeavour check it from believing that though there were on each side continual subjects offence neither family could now do without it great house accordingly they went sit full half hour old fashioned square parlour with small carpet shining floor which present daughters house were gradually giving proper air confusion by grand piano forte harp flower stands little tables placed every direction oh could originals portraits against wainscot could gentlemen brown velvet ladies blue satin have seen what was going on have been conscious such overthrow all order neatness portraits themselves seemed be staring astonishment musgroves like their houses were state alteration perhaps improvement father mother were old english style young people new mr mrs musgrove were very good sort people friendly hospitable not much educated not at all elegant their children had more modern minds manners there was numerous family but only two grown up excepting charles were henrietta louisa young ladies nineteen twenty who had brought from school at exeter all usual stock accomplishments were now like thousands other young ladies living be fashionable happy merry their dress had every advantage their faces were rather pretty their spirits extremely good their manner unembarrassed pleasant they were consequence at home favourites abroad anne always contemplated them as some happiest creatures her acquaintance but still saved as we all are by some comfortable feeling superiority from wishing for possibility exchange she would not have given up her own more elegant cultivated mind for all their enjoyments envied them nothing but that seemingly perfect good understanding agreement together that good humoured mutual affection which she had known so little herself with either her sisters they were received with great cordiality nothing seemed amiss on side great house family which was generally as anne very well knew least blame half hour was chatted away pleasantly enough she was not at all surprised at end it have their walking party joined by both miss musgroves at mary s particular invitation chapter vi anne had not wanted this visit uppercross learn that removal from one set people another though at distance only three miles will often include total change conversation opinion idea she had never been staying there before without being struck by it or without wishing that other elliots could have her advantage seeing how unknown or unconsidered there were affairs which at kellynch hall were treated as such general publicity pervading interest yet with all this experience she believed she must now submit feel that another lesson art knowing our own nothingness beyond our own circle was become necessary for her for certainly coming as she did with heart full subject which had been completely occupying both houses kellynch for many weeks she had expected rather more curiosity sympathy than she found separate but very similar remark mr mrs musgrove so miss anne sir walter your sister are gone what part bath do you think they will settle this without much waiting for answer or young ladies addition i hope we shall be bath winter but remember papa if we do go we must be good situation none your queen squares for us or anxious supplement from mary upon my word i shall be pretty well off when you are all gone away be happy at bath she could only resolve avoid such self delusion future think with heightened gratitude extraordinary blessing having one such truly sympathising friend as lady russell mr musgroves had their own game guard destroy their own horses dogs newspapers engage them females were fully occupied all other common subjects housekeeping neighbours dress dancing music she acknowledged it be very fitting that every little social commonwealth should dictate its own matters discourse hoped ere long become not unworthy member one she was now transplanted into with prospect spending at least two months at uppercross it was highly incumbent on her clothe her imagination her memory all her ideas as much uppercross as possible she had no dread these two months mary was not so repulsive unsisterly as elizabeth nor so inaccessible all influence hers neither was there anything among other component parts cottage inimical comfort she was always on friendly terms with her brother law children who loved her nearly as well respected her great deal more than their mother she had object interest amusement wholesome exertion charles musgrove was civil agreeable sense temper he was undoubtedly superior his wife but not powers or conversation or grace make past as they were connected together at all dangerous contemplation though at same time anne could believe with lady russell that more equal match might have greatly improved him that woman real understanding might have given more consequence his character more usefulness rationality elegance his habits pursuits as it was he did nothing with much zeal but sport his time was otherwise trifled away without benefit from books or anything else he had very good spirits which never seemed much affected by his wife s occasional lowness bore with her unreasonableness sometimes anne s admiration upon whole though there was very often little disagreement which she had sometimes more share than she wished being appealed by both parties they might pass for happy couple they were always perfectly agreed want more money strong inclination for handsome present from his father but here as on most topics he had superiority for while mary thought it great shame that such present was not made he always contended for his father s having many other uses for his money right spend it as he liked as management their children his theory was much better than his wife s his practice not so bad i could manage them very well if it were not for mary s interference was what anne often heard him say had good deal faith but when listening turn mary s reproach charles spoils children so that i cannot get them into any order she never had smallest temptation say very true one least agreeable circumstances her residence there was her being treated with too much confidence by all parties being too much secret complaints each house known have some influence with her sister she was continually requested or at least receiving hints exert it beyond what was practicable i wish you could persuade mary not be always fancying herself ill was charles s language unhappy mood thus spoke mary i do believe if charles were see me dying he would not think there was anything matter with me i am sure anne if you would you might persuade him that i really am very ill great deal worse than i ever own mary s declaration was i hate sending children great house though their grandmamma is always wanting see them for she humours indulges them such degree gives them so much trash sweet things that they are sure come back sick cross for rest day mrs musgrove took first opportunity being alone with anne say oh miss anne i cannot help wishing mrs charles had little your method with those children they are quite different creatures with you but be sure general they are so spoilt it is pity you cannot put your sister way managing them they are as fine healthy children as ever were seen poor little dears without partiality but mrs charles knows no more how they should be treated bless me how troublesome they are sometimes i assure you miss anne it prevents my wishing see them at our house so often as i otherwise should i believe mrs charles is not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener but you know it is very bad have children with one that one is obligated be checking every moment don t do this don t do that or that one can only keep tolerable order by more cake than is good for them she had this communication moreover from mary mrs musgrove thinks all her servants so steady that it would be high treason call it question but i am sure without exaggeration that her upper house maid laundry maid instead being their business are gadding about village all day long i meet them wherever i go i declare i never go twice into my nursery without seeing something them if jemima were not trustiest steadiest creature world it would be enough spoil her for she tells me they are always tempting her take walk with them on mrs musgrove s side it was i make rule never interfering any my daughter law s concerns for i know it would not do but i shall tell you miss anne because you may be able set things rights that i have no very good opinion mrs charles s nursery maid i hear strange stories her she is always upon gad from my own knowledge i can declare she is such fine dressing lady that she is enough ruin any servants she comes near mrs charles quite swears by her i know but i just give you this hint that you may be upon watch because if you see anything amiss you need not be afraid mentioning it again it was mary s complaint that mrs musgrove was very apt not give her precedence that was her due when they dined at great house with other families she did not see any reason why she was be considered so much at home as lose her place one day when anne was walking with only musgroves one them after talking rank people rank jealousy rank said i have no scruple observing you how nonsensical some persons are about their place because all world knows how easy indifferent you are about it but i wish anybody could give mary hint that it would be great deal better if she were not so very tenacious especially if she would not be always putting herself forward take place mamma nobody doubts her right have precedence mamma but it would be more becoming her not be always insisting on it it is not that mamma cares about it least world but i know it is taken notice by many persons how was anne set all these matters rights she could do little more than listen patiently soften every grievance excuse each other give them all hints forbearance necessary between such near neighbours make those hints broadest which were meant for her sister s benefit all other respects her visit began proceeded very well her own spirits improved by change place subject by being removed three miles from kellynch mary s ailments lessened by having constant companion their daily intercourse with other family since there was neither superior affection confidence nor employment cottage be interrupted by it was rather advantage it was certainly carried nearly as far as possible for they met every morning hardly ever spent evening asunder but she believed they should not have done so well without sight mr mrs musgrove s respectable forms usual places or without talking laughing singing their daughters she played great deal better than either miss musgroves but having no voice no knowledge harp no fond parents sit by fancy themselves delighted her performance was little thought only out civility or refresh others as she was well aware she knew that when she played she was giving pleasure only herself but this was no new sensation excepting one short period her life she had never since age fourteen never since loss her dear mother known happiness being listened or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste music she had been always used feel alone world mr mrs musgrove s fond partiality for their own daughters performance total indifference any other person s gave her much more pleasure for their sakes than mortification for her own party at great house was sometimes increased by other company neighbourhood was not large but musgroves were visited by everybody had more dinner parties more callers more visitors by invitation by chance than any other family they were more completely popular girls were wild for dancing evenings ended occasionally unpremeditated little ball there was family cousins within walk uppercross less affluent circumstances who depended on musgroves for all their pleasures they would come at any time help play at anything or dance anywhere anne very much preferring office musician more active post played country dances them by hour together kindness which always recommended her musical powers notice mr mrs musgrove more than anything else often drew this compliment well done miss anne very well done indeed lord bless me how those little fingers yours fly about so passed first three weeks michaelmas came now anne s heart must be kellynch again beloved home made over others all precious rooms furniture groves prospects beginning own other eyes other limbs she could not think much else on 29th september she had this sympathetic touch evening from mary who on having occasion note down day month exclaimed dear me is not this day crofts were come kellynch i am glad i did not think it before how low it makes me crofts took possession with true naval alertness were be visited mary deplored necessity for herself nobody knew how much she should suffer she should put it off as long as she could but was not easy till she had talked charles into driving her over on early day was very animated comfortable state imaginary agitation when she came back anne had very sincerely rejoiced there being no means her going she wished however see crofts was glad be within when visit was returned they came master house was not at home but two sisters were together as it chanced that mrs croft fell share anne while admiral sat by mary made himself very agreeable by his good humoured notice her little boys she was well able watch for likeness if it failed her features catch it voice or turn sentiment expression mrs croft though neither tall nor fat had squareness uprightness vigour form which gave importance her person she had bright dark eyes good teeth altogether agreeable face though her reddened weather beaten complexion consequence her having been almost as much at sea as her husband made her seem have lived some years longer world than her real eight thirty her manners were open easy decided like one who had no distrust herself no doubts what do without any approach coarseness however or any want good humour anne gave her credit indeed for feelings great consideration towards herself all that related kellynch it pleased her especially as she had satisfied herself very first half minute instant even introduction that there was not smallest symptom any knowledge or suspicion on mrs croft s side give bias any sort she was quite easy on that head consequently full strength courage till for moment electrified by mrs croft s suddenly saying it was you not your sister i find that my brother had pleasure being acquainted with when he was this country anne hoped she had outlived age blushing but age emotion she certainly had not perhaps you may not have heard that he is married added mrs croft she could now answer as she ought was happy feel when mrs croft s next words explained it be mr wentworth whom she spoke that she had said nothing which might not do for either brother she immediately felt how reasonable it was that mrs croft should be thinking speaking edward not frederick with shame at her own forgetfulness applied herself knowledge their former neighbour s present state with proper interest rest was all tranquillity till just as they were moving she heard admiral say mary we are expecting brother mrs croft s here soon i dare say you know him by name he was cut short by eager attacks little boys clinging him like old friend declaring he should not go being too much engrossed by proposals carrying them away his coat pockets c have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he had begun anne was left persuade herself as well as she could that same brother must still be question she could not however reach such degree certainty as not be anxious hear whether anything had been said on subject at other house where crofts had previously been calling folks great house were spend evening this day at cottage it being now too late year for such visits be made on foot coach was beginning be listened for when youngest miss musgrove walked that she was coming apologize that they should have spend evening by themselves was first black idea mary was quite ready be affronted when louisa made all right by saying that she only came on foot leave more room for harp which was bringing carriage i will tell you our reason she added all about it i am come on give you notice that papa mamma are out spirits this evening especially mamma she is thinking so much poor richard we agreed it would be best have harp for it seems amuse her more than piano forte i will tell you why she is out spirits when crofts called this morning they called here afterwards did not they they happened say that her brother captain wentworth is just returned england or paid off or something is coming see them almost directly most unluckily it came into mamma s head when they were gone that wentworth or something very like it was name poor richard s captain at one time i do not know when or where but great while before he died poor fellow upon looking over his letters things she found it was so is perfectly sure that this must be very man her head is quite full it poor richard so we must be as merry as we can that she may not be dwelling upon such gloomy things real circumstances this pathetic piece family history were that musgroves had had ill fortune very troublesome hopeless son good fortune lose him before he reached his twentieth year that he had been sent sea because he was stupid unmanageable on shore that he had been very little cared for at any time by his family though quite as much as he deserved seldom heard scarcely at all regretted when intelligence his death abroad had worked its way uppercross two years before he had fact though his sisters were now doing all they could for him by calling him poor richard been nothing better than thick headed unfeeling unprofitable dick musgrove who had never done anything entitle himself more than abbreviation his name living or dead he had been several years at sea had course those removals which all midshipmen are liable especially such midshipmen as every captain wishes get rid been six months on board captain frederick wentworth s frigate laconia from laconia he had under influence his captain written only two letters which his father mother had ever received from him during whole his absence that is say only two disinterested letters all rest had been mere applications for money each letter he had spoken well his captain but yet so little were they habit attending such matters so unobservant incurious were they as names men or ships that it had made scarcely any impression at time that mrs musgrove should have been suddenly struck this very day with recollection name wentworth as connected with her son seemed one those extraordinary bursts mind which do sometimes occur she had gone her letters found it all as she supposed re perusal these letters after so long interval her poor son gone for ever all strength his faults forgotten had affected her spirits exceedingly thrown her into greater grief for him than she had known on first hearing his death mr musgrove was lesser degree affected likewise when they reached cottage they were evidently want first being listened anew on this subject afterwards all relief which cheerful companions could give them hear them talking so much captain wentworth repeating his name so often puzzling over past years at last ascertaining that it might that it probably would turn out be very same captain wentworth whom they recollected meeting once or twice after their coming back from clifton very fine young man but they could not say whether it was seven or eight years ago was new sort trial anne s nerves she found however that it was one which she must inure herself since he actually was expected country she must teach herself be insensible on such points not only did it appear that he was expected speedily but musgroves their warm gratitude for kindness he had shewn poor dick very high respect for his character stamped as it was by poor dick s having been six months under his care mentioning him strong though not perfectly well spelt praise as fine dashing felow only two perticular about schoolmaster were bent on introducing themselves seeking his acquaintance as soon as they could hear his arrival resolution doing so helped form comfort their evening chapter vii very few days more captain wentworth was known be at kellynch mr musgrove had called on him come back warm his praise he was engaged with crofts dine at uppercross by end another week it had been great disappointment mr musgrove find that no earlier day could be fixed so impatient was he shew his gratitude by seeing captain wentworth under his own roof welcoming him all that was strongest best his cellars but week must pass only week anne s reckoning then she supposed they must meet soon she began wish that she could feel secure even for week captain wentworth made very early return mr musgrove s civility she was all but calling there same half hour she mary were actually setting forward for great house where as she afterwards learnt they must inevitably have found him when they were stopped by eldest boy s being at that moment brought home consequence bad fall child s situation put visit entirely aside but she could not hear her escape with indifference even midst serious anxiety which they afterwards felt on his account his collar bone was found be dislocated such injury received back as roused most alarming ideas it was afternoon distress anne had every thing do at once apothecary send for father have pursued informed mother support keep from hysterics servants control youngest child banish poor suffering one attend soothe besides sending as soon as she recollected it proper notice other house which brought her accession rather frightened enquiring companions than very useful assistants her brother s return was first comfort he could take best care his wife second blessing was arrival apothecary till he came had examined child their apprehensions were worse for being vague they suspected great injury but knew not where but now collar bone was soon replaced though mr robinson felt felt rubbed looked grave spoke low words both father aunt still they were all hope best be able part eat their dinner tolerable ease mind then it was just before they parted that two young aunts were able so far digress from their nephew s state as give information captain wentworth s visit staying five minutes behind their father mother endeavour express how perfectly delighted they were with him how much handsomer how infinitely more agreeable they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance who had been at all favourite before how glad they had been hear papa invite him stay dinner how sorry when he said it was quite out his power how glad again when he had promised reply papa mamma s farther pressing invitations come dine with them on morrow actually on morrow he had promised it so pleasant manner as if he felt all motive their attention just as he ought short he had looked said everything with such exquisite grace that they could assure them all their heads were both turned by him off they ran quite as full glee as love apparently more full captain wentworth than little charles same story same raptures were repeated when two girls came with their father through gloom evening make enquiries mr musgrove no longer under first uneasiness about his heir could add his confirmation praise hope there would be now no occasion for putting captain wentworth off only be sorry think that cottage party probably would not like leave little boy give him meeting oh no as leaving little boy both father mother were much too strong recent alarm bear thought anne joy escape could not help adding her warm protestations theirs charles musgrove indeed afterwards shewed more inclination child was going on so well he wished so much be introduced captain wentworth that perhaps he might join them evening he would not dine from home but he might walk for half hour but this he was eagerly opposed by his wife with oh no indeed charles i cannot bear have you go away only think if anything should happen child had good night was going on well next day it must be work time ascertain that no injury had been done spine but mr robinson found nothing increase alarm charles musgrove began consequently feel no necessity for longer confinement child was be kept bed amused as quietly as possible but what was there for father do this was quite female case it would be highly absurd him who could be no use at home shut himself up his father very much wished him meet captain wentworth there being no sufficient reason against it he ought go it ended his making bold public declaration when he came from shooting his meaning dress directly dine at other house nothing can be going on better than child said he so i told my father just now that i would come he thought me quite right your sister being with you my love i have no scruple at all you would not like leave him yourself but you see i can be no use anne will send for me if anything is matter husbands wives generally understand when opposition will be vain mary knew from charles s manner speaking that he was quite determined on going that it would be no use teaze him she said nothing therefore till he was out room but as soon as there was only anne hear so you i are be left shift by ourselves with this poor sick child not creature coming near us all evening i knew how it would be this is always my luck if there is anything disagreeable going on men are always sure get out it charles is as bad as any them very unfeeling i must say it is very unfeeling him be running away from his poor little boy talks his being going on so well how does he know that he is going on well or that there may not be sudden change half hour hence i did not think charles would have been so unfeeling so here he is go away enjoy himself because i am poor mother i am not be allowed stir yet i am sure i am more unfit than anybody else be about child my being mother is very reason why my feelings should not be tried i am not at all equal it you saw how hysterical i was yesterday but that was only effect suddenness your alarm shock you will not be hysterical again i dare say we shall have nothing distress us i perfectly understand mr robinson s directions have no fears indeed mary i cannot wonder at your husband nursing does not belong man it

feelings are great deal properest person you can make little charles do anything he always minds you at word it will be great deal better than leaving him only with jemima oh i shall certainly go i am

tell charles get ready directly you can send for us you know at moment s notice if anything is matter but i dare say there will be nothing alarm you i should not go you may be sure if i did not feel quite at ease about my dear child next moment she was tapping at her husband s dressing room door as anne followed her up stairs she was time for whole conversation which began with mary s saying tone great exultation i mean go with you charles for i am no more use at home than you are if i were shut myself up for ever with child i should not be able persuade him do anything he did not like anne will stay anne undertakes stay at home take care him it is anne s own proposal so i shall go with you which will be great deal better for i have not dined at other house since tuesday this is very kind anne was her husband s answer i should be very glad have you go but it seems rather hard that she should be left at home by herself nurse our sick child anne was now at hand take up her own cause sincerity her manner being soon sufficient convince him where conviction was at least very agreeable he had no farther scruples as her being left dine alone though he still wanted her join them evening when child might be at rest for night kindly urged her let him come fetch her but she was quite unpersuadable this being case she had ere long pleasure seeing them set off together high spirits they were gone she hoped be happy however oddly constructed such happiness might seem as for herself she was left with as many sensations comfort as were perhaps ever likely be hers she knew herself be first utility child what was it her if frederick wentworth were only half mile distant making himself agreeable others she would have liked know how he felt as meeting perhaps indifferent if indifference could exist under such circumstances he must be either indifferent or unwilling had he wished ever see her again he need not have waited till this time he would have done what she could not but believe that his place she should have done long ago when events had been early giving him independence which alone had been wanting her brother sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance their visit general there had been music singing talking laughing all that was most agreeable charming manners captain wentworth no shyness or reserve they seemed all know each other perfectly he was coming very next morning shoot with charles he was come breakfast but not at cottage though that had been proposed at first but then he had been pressed come great house instead he seemed afraid being mrs charles musgrove s way on account child therefore somehow they hardly knew how it ended charles s being meet him breakfast at his father s anne understood it he wished avoid seeing her he had inquired after her she found slightly as might suit former slight acquaintance seeming acknowledge such as she had acknowledged actuated perhaps by same view escaping introduction when they were meet morning hours cottage were always later than those other house on morrow difference was so great that mary anne were not more than beginning breakfast when charles came say that they were just setting off that he was come for his dogs that his sisters were following with captain wentworth his sisters meaning visit mary child captain wentworth proposing also wait on her for few minutes if not inconvenient though charles had answered for child s being no such state as could make it inconvenient captain wentworth would not be satisfied without his running on give notice mary very much gratified by this attention was delighted receive him while thousand feelings rushed on anne which this was most consoling that it would soon be over it was soon over two minutes after charles s preparation others appeared they were drawing room her eye half met captain wentworth s bow curtsey passed she heard his voice he talked mary said all that was right said something miss musgroves enough mark easy footing room seemed full full persons voices but few minutes ended it charles shewed himself at window all was ready their visitor had bowed was gone miss musgroves were gone too suddenly resolving walk end village with sportsmen room was cleared anne might finish her breakfast as she could it is over it is over she repeated herself again again nervous gratitude worst is over mary talked but she could not attend she had seen him they had met they had been once more same room soon however she began reason with herself try be feeling less eight years almost eight years had passed since all had been given up how absurd be resuming agitation which such interval had banished into distance indistinctness what might not eight years do events every description changes alienations removals all all must be comprised it oblivion past how natural how certain too it included nearly third part her own life alas with all her reasoning she found that retentive feelings eight years may be little more than nothing now how were his sentiments be read was this like wishing avoid her next moment she was hating herself for folly which asked question on one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom might not have prevented she was soon spared all suspense for after miss musgroves had returned finished their visit at cottage she had this spontaneous information from mary captain wentworth is not very gallant by you anne though he was so attentive me henrietta asked him what he thought you when they went away he said you were so altered he should not have known you again mary had no feelings make her respect her sister s common way but she was perfectly unsuspicious being inflicting any peculiar wound altered beyond his knowledge anne fully submitted silent deep mortification doubtless it was so she could take no revenge for he was not altered or not for worse she had already acknowledged it herself she could not think differently let him think her as he would no years which had destroyed her youth bloom had only given him more glowing manly open look no respect lessening his personal advantages she had seen same frederick wentworth so altered that he should not have known her again these were words which could not but dwell with her yet she soon began rejoice that she had heard them they were sobering tendency they allayed agitation they composed consequently must make her happier frederick wentworth had used such words or something like them but without idea that they would be carried round her he had thought her wretchedly altered first moment appeal had spoken as he felt he had not forgiven anne elliot she had used him ill deserted disappointed him worse she had shewn feebleness character doing so which his own decided confident temper could not endure she had given him up oblige others it had been effect over persuasion it had been weakness timidity he had been most warmly attached her had never seen woman since whom he thought her equal but except from some natural sensation curiosity he had no desire meeting her again her power with him was gone for ever it was now his object marry he was rich being turned on shore fully intended settle as soon as he could be properly tempted actually looking round ready fall love with all speed which clear head quick taste could allow he had heart for either miss musgroves if they could catch it heart short for any pleasing young woman who came his way excepting anne elliot this was his only secret exception when he said his sister answer her suppositions yes here i am sophia quite ready make foolish match anybody between fifteen thirty may have me for asking little beauty few smiles few compliments navy i am lost man should not this be enough for sailor who has had no society among women make him nice he said it she knew be contradicted his bright proud eye spoke conviction that he was nice anne elliot was not out his thoughts when he more seriously described woman he should wish meet with strong mind with sweetness manner made first last description that is woman i want said he something little inferior i shall course put up with but it must not be much if i am fool i shall be fool indeed for i have thought on subject more than most men chapter viii from this time captain wentworth anne elliot were repeatedly same circle they were soon dining company together at mr musgrove s for little boy s state could no longer supply his aunt with pretence for absenting herself this was but beginning other dinings other meetings whether former feelings were be renewed must be brought proof former times must undoubtedly be brought recollection each they could not but be reverted year their engagement could not but be named by him little narratives or descriptions which conversation called forth his profession qualified him his disposition lead him talk that was year six that happened before i went sea year six occurred course first evening they spent together though his voice did not falter though she had no reason suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke anne felt utter impossibility from her knowledge his mind that he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself there must be same immediate association thought though she was very far from conceiving it be equal pain they had no conversation together no intercourse but what commonest civility required once so much each other now nothing there had been time when all large party now filling drawing room at uppercross they would have found it most difficult cease speak one another with exception perhaps admiral mrs croft who seemed particularly attached happy anne could allow no other exceptions even among married couples there could have been no two hearts so open no tastes so similar no feelings so unison no countenances so beloved now they were as strangers nay worse than strangers for they could never become acquainted it was perpetual estrangement when he talked she heard same voice discerned same mind there was very general ignorance all naval matters throughout party he was very much questioned especially by two miss musgroves who seemed hardly have any eyes but for him as manner living on board daily regulations food hours c their surprise at his accounts at learning degree accommodation arrangement which was practicable drew from him some pleasant ridicule which reminded anne early days when she too had been ignorant she too had been accused supposing sailors be living on board without anything eat or any cook dress it if there were or any servant wait or any knife fork use from thus listening thinking she was roused by whisper mrs musgrove s who overcome by fond regrets could not help saying ah miss anne if it had pleased heaven spare my poor son i dare say he would have been just such another by this time anne suppressed smile listened kindly while mrs musgrove relieved her heart little more for few minutes therefore could not keep pace with conversation others when she could let her attention take its natural course again she found miss musgroves just fetching navy list their own navy list first that had ever been at uppercross sitting down together pore over it with professed view finding out ships that captain wentworth had commanded your first was asp i remember we will look for asp you will not find her there quite worn out broken up i was last man who commanded her hardly fit for service then reported fit for home service for year or two so i was sent off west indies girls looked all amazement admiralty he continued entertain themselves now then with sending few hundred men sea ship not fit be employed but they have great many provide for among thousands that may just as well go bottom as not it is impossible for them distinguish very set who may be least missed phoo phoo cried admiral what stuff these young fellows talk never was better sloop than asp her day for old built sloop you would not see her equal lucky fellow get her he knows there must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her at same time lucky fellow get anything so soon with no more interest than his i felt my luck admiral i assure you replied captain wentworth seriously i was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire it was great object with me at that time be at sea very great object i wanted be doing something be sure you did what should young fellow like you do ashore for half year together if man had not wife he soon wants be afloat again but captain wentworth cried louisa how vexed you must have been when you came asp see what old thing they had given you i knew pretty well what she was before that day said he smiling i had no more discoveries make than you would have as fashion strength any old pelisse which you had seen lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember which at last on some very wet day is lent yourself ah she was dear old asp me she did all that i wanted i knew she would i knew that we should either go bottom together or that she would be making me i never had two days foul weather all time i was at sea her after taking privateers enough be very entertaining i had good luck my passage home next autumn fall with very french frigate i wanted i brought her into plymouth here another instance luck we had not been six hours sound when gale came on which lasted four days nights which would have done for poor old asp half time our touch with great nation not having much improved our condition four twenty hours later i should only have been gallant captain wentworth small paragraph at one corner newspapers being lost only sloop nobody would have thought about me anne s shudderings were herself alone but miss musgroves could be as open as they were sincere their exclamations pity horror so then i suppose said mrs musgrove low voice as if thinking aloud so then he went away laconia there he met with our poor boy charles my dear beckoning him her do ask captain wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother i always forgot it was at gibraltar mother i know dick had been left ill at gibraltar with recommendation from his former captain captain wentworth oh but charles tell captain wentworth he need not be afraid mentioning poor dick before me for it would be rather pleasure hear him talked by such good friend charles being somewhat more mindful probabilities case only nodded reply walked away girls were now hunting for laconia captain wentworth could not deny himself pleasure taking precious volume into his own hands save them trouble once more read aloud little statement her name rate present non commissioned class observing over it that she too had been one best friends man ever had ah those were pleasant days when i had laconia how fast i made money her friend mine i had such lovely cruise together off western islands poor harville sister you know how much he wanted money worse than myself he had wife excellent fellow i shall never forget his happiness he felt it all so much for her sake i wished for him again next summer when i had still same luck mediterranean i am sure sir said mrs musgrove it was lucky day for us when you were put captain into that ship we shall never forget what you did her feelings made her speak low captain wentworth hearing only part probably not having dick musgrove at all near his thoughts looked rather suspense as if waiting for more my brother whispered one girls mamma is thinking poor richard poor dear fellow continued mrs musgrove he was grown so steady such excellent correspondent while he was under your care ah it would have been happy thing if he had never left you i assure you captain wentworth we are very sorry he ever left you there was momentary expression captain wentworth s face at this speech certain glance his bright eye curl his handsome mouth which convinced anne that instead sharing mrs musgrove s kind wishes as her son he had probably been at some pains get rid him but it was too transient indulgence self amusement be detected by any who understood him less than herself another moment he was perfectly collected serious almost instantly afterwards coming up sofa on which she mrs musgrove were sitting took place by latter entered into conversation with her low voice about her son doing it with so much sympathy natural grace as shewed kindest consideration for all that was real unabsurd parent s feelings they were actually on same sofa for mrs musgrove had most readily made room for him they were divided only by mrs musgrove it was no insignificant barrier indeed mrs musgrove was comfortable substantial size infinitely more fitted by nature express good cheer good humour than tenderness sentiment while agitations anne s slender form pensive face may be considered as very completely screened captain wentworth should be allowed some credit for self command with which he attended her large fat sighings over destiny son whom alive nobody had cared for personal size mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions large bulky figure has as good right be deep affliction as most graceful set limbs world but fair or not fair there are unbecoming conjunctions which reason will patronize vain which taste cannot tolerate which ridicule will seize admiral after taking two or three refreshing turns about room with his hands behind him being called order by his wife now came up captain wentworth without any observation what he might be interrupting thinking only his own thoughts began with if you had been week later at lisbon last spring frederick you would have been asked give passage lady mary grierson her daughters should i i am glad i was not week later then admiral abused him for his want gallantry he defended himself though professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies on board ship his excepting for ball or visit which few hours might comprehend but if i know myself said he this is from no want gallantry towards them it is rather from feeling how impossible it is with all one s efforts all one s sacrifices make accommodations on board such as women ought have there can be no want gallantry admiral rating claims women every personal comfort high this is what i do i hate hear women on board or see them on board no ship under my command shall ever convey family ladies anywhere if i can help it this brought his sister upon him oh frederick but i cannot believe it you all idle refinement women may be as comfortable on board as best house england i believe i have lived as much on board as most women i know nothing superior accommodations man war i declare i have not comfort or indulgence about me even at kellynch hall with kind bow anne beyond what i always had most ships i have lived they have been five altogether nothing purpose replied her brother you were living with your husband were only woman on board but you yourself brought mrs harville her sister her cousin three children round from portsmouth plymouth where was this superfine extraordinary sort gallantry yours then all merged my friendship sophia i would assist any brother officer s wife that i could i would bring anything harville s from world s end if he wanted it but do not imagine that i did not feel it evil itself depend upon it they were all perfectly comfortable i might not like them better for that perhaps such number women children have no right be comfortable on board my dear frederick you are talking quite idly pray what would become us poor sailors wives who often want be conveyed one port or another after our husbands if everybody had your feelings my feelings you see did not prevent my taking mrs harville all her family plymouth but i hate hear you talking so like fine gentleman as if women were all fine ladies instead rational creatures we none us expect be smooth water all our days ah my dear said admiral when he has got wife he will sing different tune when he is married if we have good luck live another war we shall see him do as you i great many others have done we shall have him very thankful anybody that will bring him his wife ay that we shall now i have done cried captain wentworth when once married people begin attack me with oh you will think very differently when you are married i can only say no i shall not then they say again yes you will there is end it he got up moved away what great traveller you must have been ma am said mrs musgrove mrs croft pretty well ma am fifteen years my marriage though many women have done more i have crossed atlantic four times have been once east indies back again only once besides being different places about home cork lisbon gibraltar but i never went beyond streights never was west indies we do not call bermuda or bahama you know west indies mrs musgrove had not word say dissent she could not accuse herself having ever called them anything whole course her life i do assure you ma am pursued mrs croft that nothing can exceed accommodations man war i speak you know higher rates when you come frigate course you are more confined though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy one them i can safely say that happiest part my life has been spent on board ship while we were together you know there was nothing be feared thank god i have always been blessed with excellent health no climate disagrees with me little disordered always first twenty four hours going sea but never knew what sickness was afterwards only time i ever really suffered body or mind only time that i ever fancied myself unwell or had any ideas danger was winter that i passed by myself at deal when admiral captain croft then was north seas i lived perpetual fright at that time had all manner imaginary complaints from not knowing what do with myself or when i should hear from him next but as long as we could be together nothing ever ailed me i never met with smallest inconvenience aye be sure yes indeed oh yes i am quite your opinion mrs croft was mrs musgrove s hearty answer there is nothing so bad as separation i am quite your opinion i know what it is for mr musgrove always attends assizes i am so glad when they are over he is safe back again evening ended with dancing on its being proposed anne offered her services as usual though her eyes would sometimes fill with tears as she sat at instrument she was extremely glad be employed desired nothing return but be unobserved it was merry joyous party no one seemed higher spirits than captain wentworth she felt that he had every thing elevate him which general attention deference especially attention all young women could do miss hayters females family cousins already mentioned were apparently admitted honour being love with him as for henrietta louisa they both seemed so entirely occupied by him that nothing but continued appearance most perfect good will between themselves could have made it credible that they were not decided rivals if he were little spoilt by such universal such eager admiration who could wonder these were some thoughts which occupied anne while her fingers were mechanically at work proceeding for half hour together equally without error without consciousness once she felt that he was looking at herself observing her altered features perhaps trying trace them ruins face which had once charmed him once she knew that he must have spoken her she was hardly aware it till she heard answer but then she was sure his having asked his partner whether miss elliot never danced answer was oh no never she has quite given up dancing she had rather play she is never tired playing once too he spoke her she had left instrument on dancing being over he had sat down try make out air which he wished give miss musgroves idea unintentionally she returned that part room he saw her instantly rising said with studied politeness i beg your pardon madam this is your seat though she immediately drew back with decided negative he was not be induced sit down again anne did not wish for more such looks speeches his cold politeness his ceremonious grace were worse than anything chapter ix captain wentworth was come kellynch as home stay as long as he liked being as thoroughly object admiral s fraternal kindness as his wife s he had intended on first arriving proceed very soon into shropshire visit brother settled that country but attractions uppercross induced him put this off there was so much friendliness flattery everything most bewitching his reception there old were so hospitable young so agreeable that he could not but resolve remain where he was take all charms perfections edward s wife upon credit little longer it was soon uppercross with him almost every day musgroves could hardly be more ready invite than he come particularly morning when he had no companion at home for admiral mrs croft were generally out doors together interesting themselves their new possessions their grass their sheep dawdling about way not endurable third person or driving out gig lately added their establishment hitherto there had been but one opinion captain wentworth among musgroves their dependencies it was unvarying warm admiration everywhere but this intimate footing was not more than established when certain charles hayter returned among them be good deal disturbed by it think captain wentworth very much way charles hayter was eldest all cousins very amiable pleasing young man between whom henrietta there had been considerable appearance attachment previous captain wentworth s introduction he was orders having curacy neighbourhood where residence was not required lived at his father s house only two miles from uppercross short absence from home had left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period when he came back he had pain finding very altered manners seeing captain wentworth mrs musgrove mrs hayter were sisters they had each had money but their marriages had made material difference their degree consequence mr hayter had some property his own but it was insignificant compared with mr musgrove s while musgroves were first class society country young hayters would from their parents inferior retired unpolished way living their own defective education have been hardly any class at all but for their connexion with uppercross this eldest son course excepted who had chosen be scholar gentleman who was very superior cultivation manners all rest two families had always been on excellent terms there being no pride on one side no envy on other only such consciousness superiority miss musgroves as made them pleased improve their cousins charles s attentions henrietta had been observed by her father mother without any disapprobation it would not be great match for her but if henrietta liked him henrietta did seem like him henrietta fully thought so herself before captain wentworth came but from that time cousin charles had been very much forgotten which two sisters was preferred by captain wentworth was as yet quite doubtful as far as anne s observation reached henrietta was perhaps prettiest louisa had higher spirits she knew not now whether more gentle or more lively character were most likely attract him mr mrs musgrove either from seeing little or from entire confidence discretion both their daughters all young men who came near them seemed leave everything take its chance there was not smallest appearance solicitude or remark about them mansion house but it was different at cottage young couple there were more disposed speculate wonder captain wentworth had not been above four or five times miss musgroves company charles hayter had but just reappeared when anne had listen opinions her brother sister as which was one liked best charles gave it for louisa mary for henrietta but quite agreeing that have him marry either could be extremely delightful charles had never seen pleasanter man his life from what he had once heard captain wentworth himself say was very sure that he had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by war here was fortune at once besides which there would be chance what might be done any future war he was sure captain wentworth was as likely man distinguish himself as any officer navy oh it would be capital match for either his sisters upon my word it would replied mary dear me if he should rise any very great honours if he should ever be made baronet lady wentworth sounds very well that would be noble thing indeed for henrietta she would take place me then henrietta would not dislike that sir frederick lady wentworth it would be but new creation however i never think much your new creations it suited mary best think henrietta one preferred on very account charles hayter whose pretensions she wished see put end she looked down very decidedly upon hayters thought it would be quite misfortune have existing connection between families renewed very sad for herself her children you know said she i cannot think him at all fit match for henrietta considering alliances which musgroves have made she has no right throw herself away i do not think any young woman has right make choice that may be disagreeable inconvenient principal part her family be giving bad connections those who have not been used them pray who is charles hayter nothing but country curate most improper match for miss musgrove uppercross her husband however would not agree with her here for besides having regard for his cousin charles hayter was eldest son he saw things as eldest son himself now you are talking nonsense mary was therefore his answer it would not be great match for henrietta but charles has very fair chance through spicers getting something from bishop course year or two you will please remember that he is eldest son whenever my uncle dies he steps into very pretty property estate at winthrop is not less than two hundred fifty acres besides farm near taunton which is some best land country i grant you that any them but charles would be very shocking match for henrietta indeed it could not be he is only one that could be possible but he is very good natured good sort fellow whenever winthrop comes into his hands he will make different sort place it live very different sort way with that property he will never be contemptible man good freehold property no no henrietta might do worse than marry charles hayter if she has him louisa can get captain wentworth i shall be very well satisfied charles may say what he pleases cried mary anne as soon as he was out room but it would be shocking have henrietta marry charles hayter very bad thing for her still worse for me therefore it is very much be wished that captain wentworth may soon put him quite out her head i have very little doubt that he has she took hardly any notice charles hayter yesterday i wish you had been there see her behaviour as captain wentworth s liking louisa as well as henrietta it is nonsense say so for he certainly does like henrietta great deal best but charles is so positive i wish you had been with us yesterday for then you might have decided between us i am sure you would have thought as i did unless you had been determined give it against me dinner at mr musgrove s had been occasion when all these things should have been seen by anne but she had staid at home under mixed plea headache her own some return indisposition little charles she had thought only avoiding captain wentworth but escape from being appealed as umpire was now added advantages quiet evening as captain wentworth s views she deemed it more consequence that he should know his own mind early enough not be endangering happiness either sister or impeaching his own honour than that he should prefer henrietta louisa or louisa henrietta either them would all probability make him affectionate good humoured wife with regard charles hayter she had delicacy which must be pained by any lightness conduct well meaning young woman heart sympathize any sufferings it occasioned but if henrietta found herself mistaken nature her feelings alteration could not be understood too soon charles hayter had met with much disquiet mortify him his cousin s behaviour she had too old regard for him be so wholly estranged as might two meetings extinguish every past hope leave him nothing do but keep away from uppercross but there was such change as became very alarming when such man as captain wentworth was be regarded as probable cause he had been absent only two sundays when they parted had left her interested even height his wishes his prospect soon quitting his present curacy obtaining that uppercross instead it had then seemed object nearest her heart that dr shirley rector who for more than forty years had been zealously discharging all duties his office but was now growing too infirm for many them should be quite fixed on engaging curate should make his curacy quite as good as he could afford should give charles hayter promise it advantage his having come only uppercross instead going six miles another way his having every respect better curacy his belonging their dear dr shirley dear good dr shirley s being relieved from duty which he could no longer get through without most injurious fatigue had been great deal even louisa but had been almost everything henrietta when he came back alas zeal business was gone by louisa could not listen at all his account conversation which he had just held with dr shirley she was at window looking out for captain wentworth even henrietta had at best only divided attention give seemed have forgotten all former doubt solicitude negotiation well i am very glad indeed but i always thought you would have it i always thought you sure it did not appear me that short you know dr shirley must have curate you had secured his promise is he coming louisa one morning very soon after dinner at musgroves at which anne had not been present captain wentworth walked into drawing room at cottage where were only herself little invalid charles who was lying on sofa surprise finding himself almost alone with anne elliot deprived his manners their usual composure he started could only say i thought miss musgroves had been here mrs musgrove told me i should find them here before he walked window recollect himself feel how he ought behave they are up stairs with my sister they will be down few moments i dare say had been anne s reply all confusion that was natural if child had not called her come do something for him she would have been out room next moment released captain wentworth as well as herself he continued at window after calmly politely saying i hope little boy is better was silent she was obliged kneel down by sofa remain there satisfy her patient thus they continued few minutes when her very great satisfaction she heard some other person crossing little vestibule she hoped on turning her head see master house but it proved be one much less calculated for making matters easy charles hayter probably not at all better pleased by sight captain wentworth than captain wentworth had been by sight anne she only attempted say how do you do will you not sit down others will be here presently captain wentworth however came from his window apparently not ill disposed for conversation but charles hayter soon put end his attempts by seating himself near table taking up newspaper captain wentworth returned his window another minute brought another addition younger boy remarkable stout forward child two years old having got door opened for him by some one without made his determined appearance among them went straight sofa see what was going on put his claim anything good that might be giving away there being nothing eat he could only have some play as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother he began fasten himself upon her as she knelt such way that busy as she was about charles she could not shake him off she spoke him ordered entreated insisted vain once she did contrive push him away but boy had greater pleasure getting upon her back again directly walter said she get down this moment you are extremely troublesome i am very angry with you walter cried charles hayter why do you not do as you are bid do not you hear your aunt speak come me walter come cousin charles but not bit did walter stir another moment however she found herself state being released from him some one was taking him from her though he had bent down her head so much that his little sturdy hands were unfastened from around her neck he was resolutely borne away before she knew that captain wentworth had done it her sensations on discovery made her perfectly speechless she could not even thank him she could only hang over little charles with most disordered feelings his kindness stepping forward her relief manner silence which it had passed little particulars circumstance with conviction soon forced on her by noise he was studiously making with child that he meant avoid hearing her thanks rather sought testify that her conversation was last his wants produced such confusion varying but very painful agitation as she could not recover from till enabled by entrance mary miss musgroves make over her little patient their cares leave room she could not stay it might have been opportunity watching loves jealousies four they were now altogether but she could stay for none it it was evident that charles hayter was not well inclined towards captain wentworth she had strong impression his having said vext tone voice after captain wentworth s interference you ought have minded me walter i told you not teaze your aunt could comprehend his regretting that captain wentworth should do what he ought have done himself but neither charles hayter s feelings nor anybody s feelings could interest her till she had little better arranged her own she was ashamed herself quite ashamed being so nervous so overcome by such trifle but so it was it required long application solitude reflection recover her chapter x other opportunities making her observations could not fail occur anne had soon been company with all four together often enough have opinion though too wise acknowledge as much at home where she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife for while she considered louisa be rather favourite she could not but think as far as she might dare judge from memory experience that captain wentworth was not love with either they were more love with him yet there it was not love it was little fever admiration but it might probably must end love with some charles hayter seemed aware being slighted yet henrietta had sometimes air being divided between them anne longed for power representing them all what they were about pointing out some evils they were exposing themselves she did not attribute guile any it was highest satisfaction her believe captain wentworth not least aware pain he was occasioning there was no triumph no pitiful triumph his manner he had probably never heard never thought any claims charles hayter he was only wrong accepting attentions for accepting must be word two young women at once after short struggle however charles hayter seemed quit field three days had passed without his coming once uppercross most decided change he had even refused one regular invitation dinner having been found on occasion by mr musgrove with some large books before him mr mrs musgrove were sure all could not be right talked with grave faces his studying himself death it was mary s hope belief that he had received positive dismissal from henrietta her husband lived under constant dependence seeing him morrow anne could only feel that charles hayter was wise one morning about this time charles musgrove captain wentworth being gone shooting together as sisters cottage were sitting quietly at work they were visited at window by sisters from mansion house it was very fine november day miss musgroves came through little grounds stopped for no other purpose than say that they were going take long walk therefore concluded mary could not like go with them when mary immediately replied with some jealousy at not being supposed good walker oh yes i should like join you very much i am very fond long walk anne felt persuaded by looks two girls that it was precisely what they did not wish admired again sort necessity which family habits seemed produce everything being be communicated everything being be done together however undesired inconvenient she tried dissuade mary from going but vain that being case thought it best accept miss musgroves much more cordial invitation herself go likewise as she might be useful turning back with her sister lessening interference any plan their own i cannot imagine why they should suppose i should not like long walk said mary as she went up stairs everybody is always supposing that i am not good walker yet they would not have been pleased if we had refused join them when people come this manner on purpose ask us how can one say no just as they were setting off gentlemen returned they had taken out young dog who had spoilt their sport sent them back early their time strength spirits were therefore exactly ready for this walk they entered into it with pleasure could anne have foreseen such junction she would have staid at home but from some feelings interest curiosity she fancied now that it was too late retract whole six set forward together direction chosen by miss musgroves who evidently considered walk as under their guidance anne s object was not be way anybody where narrow paths across fields made many separations necessary keep with her brother sister her pleasure walk must arise from exercise day from view last smiles year upon tawny leaves withered hedges from repeating herself some few thousand poetical descriptions extant autumn that season peculiar inexhaustible influence on mind taste tenderness that season which had drawn from every poet worthy being read some attempt at description or some lines feeling she occupied her mind as much as possible such like musings quotations but it was not possible that when within reach captain wentworth s conversation with either miss musgroves she should not try hear it yet she caught little very remarkable it was mere lively chat such as any young persons on intimate footing might fall into he was more engaged with louisa than with henrietta louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister this distinction appeared increase there was one speech louisa s which struck her after one many praises day which were continually bursting forth captain wentworth added what glorious weather for admiral my sister they meant take long drive this morning perhaps we may hail them from some these hills they talked coming into this side country i wonder whereabouts they will upset day oh it does happen very often i assure you but my sister makes nothing it she would as lieve be tossed out as not ah you make most it i know cried louisa but if it were really so i should do just same her place if i loved man as she loves admiral i would always be with him nothing should ever separate us i would rather be overturned by him than driven safely by anybody else it was spoken with enthusiasm had you cried he catching same tone i honour you there was silence between them for little while anne could not immediately fall into quotation again sweet scenes autumn were for while put by unless some tender sonnet fraught with apt analogy declining year with declining happiness images youth hope spring all gone together blessed her memory she roused herself say as they struck by order into another path is not this one ways winthrop but nobody heard or at least nobody answered her winthrop however or its environs for young men are sometimes be met with strolling about near home was their destination after another half mile gradual ascent through large enclosures where ploughs at work fresh made path spoke farmer counteracting sweets poetical despondence meaning have spring again they gained summit most considerable hill which parted uppercross winthrop soon commanded full view latter at foot hill on other side winthrop without beauty without dignity was stretched before them indifferent house standing low hemmed by barns buildings farm yard mary exclaimed bless me here is winthrop i declare i had no idea well now i think we had better turn back i am excessively tired henrietta conscious ashamed seeing no cousin charles walking along any path or leaning against any gate was ready do as mary wished but no said charles musgrove no no cried louisa more eagerly taking her sister aside seemed be arguing matter warmly charles meanwhile was very decidedly declaring his resolution calling on his aunt now that he was so near very evidently though more fearfully trying induce his wife go too but this was one points on which lady shewed her strength when he recommended advantage resting herself quarter hour at winthrop as she felt so tired she resolutely answered oh no indeed walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any sitting down could do her good short her look manner declared that go she would not after little succession these sort debates consultations it was settled between charles his two sisters that he henrietta should just run down for few minutes see their aunt cousins while rest party waited for them at top hill louisa seemed principal arranger plan as she went little way with them down hill still talking henrietta mary took opportunity looking scornfully around her saying captain wentworth it is very unpleasant having such connexions but i assure you i have never been house above twice my life she received no other answer than artificial assenting smile followed by contemptuous glance as he turned away which anne perfectly knew meaning brow hill where they remained was cheerful spot louisa returned mary finding comfortable seat for herself on step stile was very well satisfied so long as others all stood about her but when louisa drew captain wentworth away try for gleaning nuts adjoining hedge row they were gone by degrees quite out sight sound mary was happy no longer she quarrelled with her own seat was sure louisa had got much better somewhere nothing could prevent her from going look for better also she turned through same gate but could not see them anne found nice seat for her on dry sunny bank under hedge row which she had no doubt their still being some spot or other mary sat down for moment but it would not do she was sure louisa had found better seat somewhere else she would go on till she overtook her anne really tired herself was glad sit down she very soon heard captain wentworth louisa hedge row behind her as if making their way back along rough wild sort channel down centre they were speaking as they drew near louisa s voice was first distinguished she seemed be middle some eager speech what anne first heard was so i made her go i could not bear that she should be frightened from visit by such nonsense what would i be turned back from doing thing that i had determined do that i knew be right by airs interference such person or any person i may say no i have no idea being so easily persuaded when i have made up my mind i have made it henrietta seemed entirely have made up hers call at winthrop day yet she was as near giving it up out nonsensical complaisance she would have turned back then but for you she would indeed i am almost ashamed say it happy for her have such mind as yours at hand after hints you gave just now which did but confirm my own observations last time i was company with him i need not affect have no comprehension what is going on i see that more than mere dutiful morning visit your aunt was question woe betide him her too when it comes things consequence when they are placed circumstances requiring fortitude strength mind if she have not resolution enough resist idle interference such trifle as this your sister is amiable creature but yours is character decision firmness i see if you value her conduct or happiness infuse as much your own spirit into her as you can but this no doubt you have been always doing it is worst evil too yielding indecisive character that no influence over it can be depended on you are never sure good impression being durable everybody may sway it let those who would be happy be firm here is nut said he catching one down from upper bough exemplify beautiful glossy nut which blessed with original strength has outlived all storms autumn not puncture not weak spot anywhere this nut he continued with playful solemnity while so many his brethren have fallen been trodden under foot is still possession all happiness that hazel nut can be supposed capable then returning his former earnest tone my first wish for all whom i am interested is that they should be firm if louisa musgrove would be beautiful happy her november life she will cherish all her present powers mind he had done was unanswered it would have surprised anne if louisa could have readily answered such speech words such interest spoken with such serious warmth she could imagine what louisa was feeling for herself she feared move lest she should be seen while she remained bush low rambling holly protected her they were moving on before they were beyond her hearing however louisa spoke again mary is good natured enough many respects said she but she does sometimes provoke me excessively by her nonsense pride elliot pride she has great deal too much elliot pride we do so wish that charles had married anne instead i suppose you know he wanted marry anne after moment s pause captain wentworth said do you mean that she refused him oh yes certainly when did that happen i do not exactly know for henrietta i were at school at time but i believe about year before he married mary i wish she had accepted him we should all have liked her great deal better papa mamma always think it was her great friend lady russell s doing that she did not they think charles might not be learned bookish enough please lady russell that therefore she persuaded anne refuse him sounds were retreating anne distinguished no more her own emotions still kept her fixed she had much recover from before she could move listener s proverbial fate was not absolutely hers she had heard no evil herself but she had heard great deal very painful import she saw how her own character was considered by captain wentworth there had been just that degree feeling curiosity about her his manner which must give her extreme agitation as soon as she could she went after mary having found walked back with her their former station by stile felt some comfort their whole party being immediately afterwards collected once more motion together her spirits wanted solitude silence which only numbers could give charles henrietta returned bringing as may be conjectured charles hayter with them minutiae business anne could not attempt understand even captain wentworth did not seem admitted perfect confidence here but that there had been withdrawing on gentleman s side relenting on lady s that they were now very glad be together again did not admit doubt henrietta looked little ashamed but very well pleased charles hayter exceedingly happy they were devoted each other almost from first instant their all setting forward for uppercross everything now marked out louisa for captain wentworth nothing could be plainer where many divisions were necessary or even where they were not they walked side by side nearly as much as other two long strip meadow land where there was ample space for all they were thus divided forming three distinct parties that party three which boasted least animation least complaisance anne necessarily belonged she joined charles mary was tired enough be very glad charles s other arm but charles though very good humour with her was out temper with his wife mary had shewn herself disobliging him was now reap consequence which consequence was his dropping her arm almost every moment cut off heads some nettles hedge with his switch when mary began complain it lament her being ill used according custom being on hedge side while anne was never incommoded on other he dropped arms both hunt after weasel which he had momentary glance they could hardly get him along at all this long meadow bordered lane which their footpath at end it was cross when party had all reached gate exit carriage advancing same direction which had been some time heard was just coming up proved be admiral croft s gig he his wife had taken their intended drive were returning home upon hearing how long walk young people had engaged they kindly offered seat any lady who might be particularly tired it would save her full mile they were going through uppercross invitation was general generally declined miss musgroves were not at all tired mary was either offended by not being asked before any others or what louisa called elliot pride could not endure make third one horse chaise walking party had crossed lane were surmounting opposite stile admiral was putting his horse motion again when captain wentworth cleared hedge moment say something his sister something might be guessed by its effects miss elliot i am sure you are tired cried mrs croft do let us have pleasure taking you home here is excellent room for three i assure you if we were all like you i believe we might sit four you must indeed you must anne was still lane though instinctively beginning decline she was not allowed proceed admiral s kind urgency came support his wife s they would not be refused they compressed themselves into smallest possible space leave her corner captain wentworth without saying word turned her quietly obliged her be assisted into carriage yes he had done it she was carriage felt that he had placed her there that his will his hands had done it that she owed it his perception her fatigue his resolution give her rest she was very much affected by view his disposition towards her which all these things made apparent this little circumstance seemed completion all that had gone before she understood him he could not forgive her but he could not be unfeeling though condemning her for past considering it with high unjust resentment though perfectly careless her though becoming attached another still he could not see her suffer without desire giving her relief it was remainder former sentiment it was impulse pure though unacknowledged friendship it was proof his own warm amiable heart which she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded pleasure pain that she knew not which prevailed her answers kindness remarks her companions were at first unconsciously given they had travelled half their way along rough lane before she was quite awake what they said she then found them talking frederick he certainly means have one or other those two girls sophy said admiral but there is no saying which he has been running after them too long enough one would think make up his mind ay this comes peace if it were war now he would have settled it long ago we sailors miss elliot cannot afford make long courtships time war how many days was it my dear between first time my seeing you our sitting down together our lodgings at north yarmouth we had better not talk about it my dear replied mrs croft pleasantly for if miss elliot were hear how soon we came understanding she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together i had known you by character however long before well i had heard you as very pretty girl what were we wait for besides i do not like having such things so long hand i wish frederick would spread little more canvass bring us home one these young ladies kellynch then there would always be company for them very nice young ladies they both are i hardly know one from other very good humoured unaffected girls indeed said mrs croft tone calmer praise such as made anne suspect that her keener powers might not consider either them as quite worthy her brother very respectable family one could not be connected with better people my dear admiral that post we shall certainly take that post but by coolly giving reins better direction herself they happily passed danger by once afterwards judiciously putting out her hand they neither fell into rut nor ran foul dung cart anne with some amusement at their style driving which she imagined no bad representation general guidance their affairs found herself safely deposited by them at cottage chapter xi time now approached for lady russell s return day was even fixed anne being engaged join her as soon as she was resettled was looking forward early removal kellynch beginning think how her own comfort was likely be affected by it it would place her same village with captain wentworth within half mile him they would have frequent same church there must be intercourse between two families this was against her but on other hand he spent so much his time at uppercross that removing thence she might be considered rather as leaving him behind than as going towards him upon whole she believed she must on this interesting question be gainer almost as certainly as her change domestic society leaving poor mary for lady russell she wished it might be possible for her avoid ever seeing captain wentworth at hall those rooms had witnessed former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her but she was yet more anxious for possibility lady russell captain wentworth never meeting anywhere they did not like each other no renewal acquaintance now could do any good were lady russell see them together she might think that he had too much self possession she too little these points formed her chief solicitude anticipating her removal from uppercross where she felt she had been stationed quite long enough her usefulness little charles would always give some sweetness memory her two months visit there but he was gaining strength apace she had nothing else stay for conclusion her visit however was diversified way which she had not at all imagined captain wentworth after being unseen unheard at uppercross for two whole days appeared again among them justify himself by relation what had kept him away letter from his friend captain harville having found him out at last had brought intelligence captain harville s being settled with his family at lyme for winter their being therefore quite unknowingly within twenty miles each other captain harville had never been good health since severe wound which he received two years before captain wentworth s anxiety see him had determined him go immediately lyme he had been there for four twenty hours his acquittal was complete his friendship warmly honoured lively interest excited for his friend his description fine country about lyme so feelingly attended by party that earnest desire see lyme themselves project for going thither was consequence young people were all wild see lyme captain wentworth talked going there again himself it was only seventeen miles from uppercross though november weather was by no means bad short louisa who was most eager eager having formed resolution go besides pleasure doing as she liked being now armed with idea merit maintaining her own way bore down all wishes her father mother for putting it off till summer lyme they were go charles mary anne henrietta louisa captain wentworth first heedless scheme had been go morning return at night but this mr musgrove for sake his horses would not consent when it came be rationally considered day middle november would not leave much time for seeing new place after deducting seven hours as nature country required for going returning they were consequently stay night there not be expected back till next day s dinner this was felt be considerable amendment though they all met at great house at rather early breakfast hour set off very punctually it was so much past noon before two carriages mr musgrove s coach containing four ladies charles s curricle which he drove captain wentworth were descending long hill into lyme entering upon still steeper street town itself that it was very evident they would not have more than time for looking about them before light warmth day were gone after securing accommodations ordering dinner at one inns next thing be done was unquestionably walk directly down sea they were come too late year for any amusement or variety which lyme as public place might offer rooms were shut up lodgers almost all gone scarcely any family but residents left as there is nothing admire buildings themselves remarkable situation town principal street almost hurrying into water walk cobb skirting round pleasant little bay which season is animated with bathing machines company cobb itself its old wonders new improvements with very beautiful line cliffs stretching out east town are what stranger s eye will seek very strange stranger it must be who does not see charms immediate environs lyme make him wish know it better scenes its neighbourhood charmouth with its high grounds extensive sweeps country still more its sweet retired bay backed by dark cliffs where fragments low rock among sands make it happiest spot for watching flow tide for sitting unwearied contemplation woody varieties cheerful village up lyme above all pinny with its green chasms between romantic rocks where scattered forest trees orchards luxuriant growth declare that many generation must have passed away since first partial falling cliff prepared ground for such state where scene so wonderful so lovely is exhibited as may more than equal any resembling scenes far famed isle wight these places must be visited visited again make worth lyme understood party from uppercross passing down by now deserted melancholy looking rooms still descending soon found themselves on sea shore lingering only as all must linger gaze on first return sea who ever deserved look on it at all proceeded towards cobb equally their object itself on captain wentworth s account for small house near foot old pier unknown date were harvilles settled captain wentworth turned call on his friend others walked on he was join them on cobb they were by no means tired wondering admiring not even louisa seemed feel that they had parted with captain wentworth long when they saw him coming after them with three companions all well known already by description be captain mrs harville captain benwick who was staying with them captain benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant laconia account which captain wentworth had given him on his return from lyme before his warm praise him as excellent young man officer whom he had always valued highly which must have stamped him well esteem every listener had been followed by little history his private life which rendered him perfectly interesting eyes all ladies he had been engaged captain harville s sister was now mourning her loss they had been year or two waiting for fortune promotion fortune came his prize money as lieutenant being great promotion too came at last but fanny harville did not live know it she had died preceding summer while he was at sea captain wentworth believed it impossible for man be more attached woman than poor benwick had been fanny harville or be more deeply afflicted under dreadful change he considered his disposition as sort which must suffer heavily uniting very strong feelings with quiet serious retiring manners decided taste for reading sedentary pursuits finish interest story friendship between him harvilles seemed if possible augmented by event which closed all their views alliance captain benwick was now living with them entirely captain harville had taken his present house for half year his taste his health his fortune all directing him residence inexpensive by sea grandeur country retirement lyme winter appeared exactly adapted captain benwick s state mind sympathy good will excited towards captain benwick was very great yet said anne herself as they now moved forward meet party he has not perhaps more sorrowing heart than i have i cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever he is younger than i am younger feeling if not fact younger as man he will rally again be happy with another they all met were introduced captain harville was tall dark man with sensible benevolent countenance little lame from strong features want health looking much older than captain wentworth captain benwick looked was youngest three compared with either them little man he had pleasing face melancholy air just as he ought have drew back from conversation captain harville though not equalling captain wentworth manners was perfect gentleman unaffected warm obliging mrs harville degree less polished than her husband seemed however have same good feelings nothing could be more pleasant than their desire considering whole party as friends their own because friends captain wentworth or more kindly hospitable than their entreaties for their all promising dine with them dinner already ordered at inn was at last though unwillingly accepted as excuse but they seemed almost hurt that captain wentworth should have brought any such party lyme without considering it as thing course that they should dine with them there was so much attachment captain wentworth all this such bewitching charm degree hospitality so uncommon so unlike usual style give take invitations dinners formality display that anne felt her spirits not likely be benefited by increasing acquaintance among his brother officers these would have been all my friends was her thought she had struggle against great tendency lowness on quitting cobb they all went doors with their new friends found rooms so small as none but those who invite from heart could think capable accommodating so many anne had moment s astonishment on subject herself but it was soon lost pleasanter feelings which sprang from sight all ingenious contrivances nice arrangements captain harville turn actual space best account supply deficiencies lodging house furniture defend windows doors against winter storms be expected varieties fitting up rooms where common necessaries provided by owner common indifferent plight were contrasted with some few articles rare species wood excellently worked up with something curious valuable from all distant countries captain harville had visited were more than amusing anne connected as it all was with his profession fruit its labours effect its influence on his habits picture repose domestic happiness it presented made it her something more or less than gratification captain harville was no reader but he had contrived excellent accommodations fashioned very pretty shelves for tolerable collection well bound volumes property captain benwick his lameness prevented him from taking much exercise but mind usefulness ingenuity seemed furnish him with constant employment within he drew he varnished he carpentered he glued he made toys for children he fashioned new netting needles pins with improvements if everything else was done sat down his large fishing net at one corner room anne thought she left great happiness behind her when they quitted house louisa by whom she found herself walking burst forth into raptures admiration delight on character navy their friendliness their brotherliness their openness their uprightness protesting that she was convinced sailors having more worth warmth than any other set men england that they only knew how live they only deserved be respected loved they went back dress dine so well had scheme answered already that nothing was found amiss though its being so entirely out season no thoroughfare lyme no expectation company had brought many apologies from heads inn anne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened being captain wentworth s company than she had at first imagined could ever be that sitting down same table with him now interchange common civilities attending on it they never got beyond was become mere nothing nights were too dark for ladies meet again till morrow but captain harville had promised them visit evening he came bringing his friend also which was more than had been expected it having been agreed that captain benwick had all appearance being oppressed by presence so many strangers he ventured among them again however though his spirits certainly did not seem fit for mirth party general while captains wentworth harville led talk on one side room by recurring former days supplied anecdotes abundance occupy entertain others it fell anne s lot be placed rather apart with captain benwick very good impulse her nature obliged her begin acquaintance with him he was shy disposed abstraction but engaging mildness her countenance gentleness her manners soon had their effect anne was well repaid first trouble exertion he was evidently young man considerable taste reading though principally poetry besides persuasion having given him at least evening s indulgence discussion subjects which his usual companions had probably no concern she had hope being real use him some suggestions as duty benefit struggling against affliction which had naturally grown out their conversation for though shy he did not seem reserved it had rather appearance feelings glad burst their usual restraints having talked poetry richness present age gone through brief comparison opinion as first rate poets trying ascertain whether marmion or lady lake were be preferred how ranked giaour bride abydos moreover how giaour was be pronounced he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all tenderest songs one poet all impassioned descriptions hopeless agony other he repeated with such tremulous feeling various lines which imaged broken heart or mind destroyed by wretchedness looked so entirely as if he meant be understood that she ventured hope he did not always read only poetry say that she thought it was misfortune poetry be seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely that strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly were very feelings which ought taste it but sparingly his looks shewing him not pained but pleased with this allusion his situation she was emboldened go on feeling herself right seniority mind she ventured recommend larger allowance prose his daily study on being requested particularize mentioned such works our best moralists such collections finest letters such memoirs characters worth suffering as occurred her at moment as calculated rouse fortify mind by highest precepts strongest examples moral religious endurances captain benwick listened attentively seemed grateful for interest implied though with shake head sighs which declared his little faith efficacy any books on grief like his noted down names those she recommended promised procure read them when evening was over anne could not but be amused at idea her coming lyme preach patience resignation young man whom she had never seen before nor could she help fearing on more serious reflection that like many other great moralists preachers she had been eloquent on point which her own conduct would ill bear examination chapter xii anne henrietta finding themselves earliest party next morning agreed stroll down sea before breakfast they went sands watch flowing tide which fine south easterly breeze was bringing with all grandeur which so flat shore admitted they praised morning gloried sea sympathized delight fresh feeling breeze were silent till henrietta suddenly began again with oh yes i am quite convinced that with very few exceptions sea air always does good there can be no doubt its having been greatest service dr shirley after his illness last spring twelvemonth he declares himself that coming lyme for month did him more good than all medicine he took that being by sea always makes him feel young again now i cannot help thinking it pity that he does not live entirely by sea i do think he had better leave uppercross entirely fix at lyme do not you anne do not you agree with me that it is best thing he could do both for himself mrs shirley she has cousins here you know many acquaintance which would make it cheerful for her i am sure she would be glad get place where she could have medical attendance at hand case his having another seizure indeed i think it quite melancholy have such excellent people as dr mrs shirley who have been doing good all their lives wearing out their last days place like uppercross where excepting our family they seem shut out from all world i wish his friends would propose it him i really think they ought as procuring dispensation there could be no difficulty at his time life with his character my only doubt is whether anything could persuade him leave his parish he is so very strict scrupulous his notions over scrupulous i must say do not you think anne it is being over scrupulous do not you think it is quite mistaken point conscience when clergyman sacrifices his health for sake duties which may be just as well performed by another person at lyme too only seventeen miles off he would be near enough hear if people thought there was anything complain anne smiled more than once herself during this speech entered into subject as ready do good by entering into feelings young lady as young man though here it was good lower standard for what could be offered but general acquiescence she said all that was reasonable proper on business felt claims dr shirley repose as she ought saw how very desirable it was that he should have some active respectable young man as resident curate was even courteous enough hint at advantage such resident curate s being married i wish said henrietta very well pleased with her companion i wish lady russell lived at uppercross were intimate with dr shirley i have always heard lady russell as woman greatest influence with everybody i always look upon her as able persuade person anything i am afraid her as i have told you before quite afraid her because she is so very clever but i respect her amazingly wish we had such neighbour at uppercross anne was amused by henrietta s manner being grateful amused also that course events new interests henrietta s views should have placed her friend at all favour with any musgrove family she had only time however for general answer wish that such another woman were at uppercross before all subjects suddenly ceased on seeing louisa captain wentworth coming towards them they came also for stroll till breakfast was likely be ready but louisa recollecting immediately afterwards that she had something procure at shop invited them all go back with her into town they were all at her disposal when they came steps leading upwards from beach gentleman at same moment preparing come down politely drew back stopped give them way they ascended passed him as they passed anne s face caught his eye he looked at her with degree earnest admiration which she could not be insensible she was looking remarkably well her very regular very pretty features having bloom freshness youth restored by fine wind which had been blowing on her complexion by animation eye which it had also produced it was evident that gentleman completely gentleman manner admired her exceedingly captain wentworth looked round at her instantly way which shewed his noticing it he gave her momentary glance glance brightness which seemed say that man is struck with you even i at this moment see something like anne elliot again after attending louisa through her business loitering about little longer they returned inn anne passing afterwards quickly from her own chamber their dining room had nearly run against very same gentleman as he came out adjoining apartment she had before conjectured him be stranger like themselves determined that well looking groom who was strolling about near two inns as they came back should be his servant both master man being mourning assisted idea it was now proved that he belonged same inn as themselves this second meeting short as it was also proved again by gentleman s looks that he thought hers very lovely by readiness propriety his apologies that he was man exceedingly good manners he seemed about thirty though not handsome had agreeable person anne felt that she should like know who he was they had nearly done breakfast when sound carriage almost first they had heard since entering lyme drew half party window it was gentleman s carriage curricle but only coming round from stable yard front door somebody must be going away it was driven by servant mourning word curricle made charles musgrove jump up that he might compare it with his own servant mourning roused anne s curiosity whole six were collected look by time owner curricle was be seen issuing from door amidst bows civilities household taking his seat drive off ah cried captain wentworth instantly with half glance at anne it is very man we passed miss musgroves agreed it having all kindly watched him as far up hill as they could they returned breakfast table waiter came into room soon afterwards pray said captain wentworth immediately can you tell us name gentleman who is just gone away yes sir mr elliot gentleman large fortune came last night from sidmouth dare say you heard carriage sir while you were at dinner going on now for crewkherne his way bath london elliot many had looked on each other many had repeated name before all this had been got through even by smart rapidity waiter bless me cried mary it must be our cousin it must be our mr elliot it must indeed charles anne must not it mourning you see just as our mr elliot must be how very extraordinary very same inn with us anne must not it be our mr elliot my father s next heir pray sir turning waiter did not you hear did not his servant say whether he belonged kellynch family no ma am he did not mention no particular family but he said his master was very rich gentleman would be baronight some day there you see cried mary ecstasy just as i said heir sir walter elliot i was sure that would come out if it was so depend upon it that is circumstance which his servants take care publish wherever he goes but anne only conceive how extraordinary i wish i had looked at him more i wish we had been aware time who it was that he might have been introduced us what pity that we should not have been introduced each other do you think he had elliot countenance i hardly looked at him i was looking at horses but i think he had something elliot countenance i wonder arms did not strike me oh great coat was hanging over panel hid arms so it did otherwise i am sure i should have observed them livery too if servant had not been mourning one should have known him by livery putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together said captain wentworth we must consider it be arrangement providence that you should not be introduced your cousin when she could command mary s attention anne quietly tried convince her that their father mr elliot had not for many years been on such terms as make power attempting introduction at all desirable at same time however it was secret gratification herself have seen her cousin know that future owner kellynch was undoubtedly gentleman had air good sense she would not upon any account mention her having met with him second time luckily mary did not much attend their having passed close by him their earlier walk but she would have felt quite ill used by anne s having actually run against him passage received his very polite excuses while she had never been near him at all no that cousinly little interview must remain perfect secret course said mary you will mention our seeing mr elliot next time you write bath i think my father certainly ought hear it do mention all about him anne avoided direct reply but it was just circumstance which she considered as not merely unnecessary be communicated but as what ought be suppressed offence which had been given her father many years back she knew elizabeth s particular share it she suspected that mr elliot s idea always produced irritation both was beyond doubt mary never wrote bath herself all toil keeping up slow unsatisfactory correspondence with elizabeth fell on anne breakfast had not been long over when they were joined by captain mrs harville captain benwick with whom they had appointed take their last walk about lyme they ought be setting off for uppercross by one meanwhile were be all together out doors as long as they could anne found captain benwick getting near her as soon as they were all fairly street their conversation preceding evening did not disincline him seek her again they walked together some time talking as before mr scott lord byron still as unable as before as unable as any other two readers think exactly alike merits either till something occasioned almost general change amongst their party instead captain benwick she had captain harville by her side miss elliot said he speaking rather low you have done good deed making that poor fellow talk so much i wish he could have such company oftener it is bad for him i know be shut up as he is but what can we do we cannot part no said anne that i can easily believe be impossible but time perhaps we know what time does every case affliction you must remember captain harville that your friend may yet be called young mourner only last summer i understand ay true enough with deep sigh only june not known him perhaps so soon not till first week august when he came home from cape just made into grappler i was at plymouth dreading hear him he sent letters but grappler was under orders for portsmouth there news must follow him but who was tell it not i i would as soon have been run up yard arm nobody could do it but that good fellow pointing captain wentworth laconia had come into plymouth week before no danger her being sent sea again he stood his chance for rest wrote up for leave absence but without waiting return travelled night day till he got portsmouth rowed off grappler that instant never left poor fellow for week that s what he did nobody else could have saved poor james you may think miss elliot whether he is dear us anne did think on question with perfect decision said as much reply as her own feeling could accomplish or as his seemed able bear for he was too much affected renew subject when he spoke again it was something totally different mrs harville s giving it as her opinion that her husband would have quite walking enough by time he reached home determined direction all party what was be their last walk they would accompany them their door then return set off themselves by all their calculations there was just time for this but as they drew near cobb there was such general wish walk along it once more all were so inclined louisa soon grew so determined that difference quarter hour it was found would be no difference at all so with all kind leave taking all kind interchange invitations promises which may be imagined they parted from captain mrs harville at their own door still accompanied by captain benwick who seemed cling them last proceeded make proper adieus cobb anne found captain benwick again drawing near her lord byron s dark blue seas could not fail being brought forward by their present view she gladly gave him all her attention as long as attention was possible it was soon drawn perforce another way there was too much wind make high part new cobb pleasant for ladies they agreed get down steps lower all were contented pass quietly carefully down steep flight excepting louisa she must be jumped down them by captain wentworth all their walks he had had jump her from stiles sensation was delightful her hardness pavement for her feet made him less willing upon present occasion he did it however she was safely down instantly show her enjoyment ran up steps be jumped down again he advised her against it thought jar too great but no he reasoned talked vain she smiled said i am determined i will he put out his hands she was too precipitate by half second she fell on pavement on lower cobb was taken up lifeless there was no wound no blood no visible bruise but her eyes were closed she breathed not her face was like death horror moment all who stood around captain wentworth who had caught her up knelt with her his arms looking on her with face as pallid as her own agony silence she is dead she is dead screamed mary catching hold her husband contributing with his own horror make him immoveable another moment henrietta sinking under conviction lost her senses too would have fallen on steps but for captain benwick anne who caught supported her between them is there no one help me were first words which burst from captain wentworth tone despair as if all his own strength were gone go him go him cried anne for heaven s sake go him i can support her myself leave me go him rub her hands rub her temples here are salts take them take them captain benwick obeyed charles at same moment disengaging himself from his wife they were both with him louisa was raised up supported more firmly between them everything was done that anne had prompted but vain while captain wentworth staggering against wall for his support exclaimed bitterest agony oh god her father mother surgeon said anne he caught word it seemed rouse him at once saying only true true surgeon this instant was darting away when anne eagerly suggested captain benwick would not it be better for captain benwick he knows where surgeon is be found every one capable thinking felt advantage idea moment it was all done rapid moments captain benwick had resigned poor corpse like figure entirely brother s care was off for town with utmost rapidity as wretched party left behind it could scarcely be said which three who were completely rational was suffering most captain wentworth anne or charles who really very affectionate brother hung over louisa with sobs grief could only turn his eyes from one sister see other state as insensible or witness hysterical agitations his wife calling on him for help which he could not give anne attending with all strength zeal thought which instinct supplied henrietta still tried at intervals suggest comfort others tried quiet mary animate charles assuage feelings captain wentworth both seemed look her for directions anne anne cried charles what is be done next what heaven s name is be done next captain wentworth s eyes were also turned towards her had not she better be carried inn yes i am sure carry her gently inn yes yes inn repeated captain wentworth comparatively collected eager be doing something i will carry her myself musgrove take care others by this time report accident had spread among workmen boatmen about cobb many were collected near them be useful if wanted at any rate enjoy sight dead young lady nay two dead young ladies for it proved twice as fine as first report some best looking these good people henrietta was consigned for though partially revived she was quite helpless this manner anne walking by her side charles attending his wife they set forward treading back with feelings unutterable ground which so lately so very lately so light heart they had passed along they were not off cobb before harvilles met them captain benwick had been seen flying by their house with countenance which showed something be wrong they had set off immediately informed directed as they passed towards spot shocked as captain harville was he brought senses nerves that could be instantly useful look between him his wife decided what was be done she must be taken their house all must go their house await surgeon s arrival there they would not listen scruples he was obeyed they were all beneath his roof while louisa under mrs harville s direction was conveyed up stairs given possession her own bed assistance cordials restoratives were supplied by her husband all who needed them louisa had once opened her eyes but soon closed them again without apparent consciousness this had been proof life however service her sister henrietta though perfectly incapable being same room with louisa was kept by agitation hope fear from return her own insensibility mary too was growing calmer surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible they were sick with horror while he examined but he was not hopeless head had received severe contusion but he had seen greater injuries recovered from he was by no means hopeless he spoke cheerfully that he did not regard it as desperate case that he did not say few hours must end it was at first felt beyond hope most ecstasy such reprieve rejoicing deep silent after few fervent ejaculations gratitude heaven had been offered may be conceived tone look with which thank god was uttered by captain wentworth anne was sure could never be forgotten by her nor sight him afterwards as he sat near table leaning over it with folded arms face concealed as if overpowered by various feelings his soul trying by prayer reflection calm them louisa s limbs had escaped there was no injury but head it now became necessary for party consider what was best be done as their general situation they were now able speak each other consult that louisa must remain where she was however distressing her friends be involving harvilles such trouble did not admit doubt her removal was impossible harvilles silenced all scruples as much as they could all gratitude they had looked forward arranged everything before others began reflect captain benwick must give up his room them get another bed elsewhere whole was settled they were only concerned that house could accommodate no more yet perhaps by putting children away maid s room or swinging cot somewhere they could hardly bear think not finding room for two or three besides supposing they might wish stay though with regard any attendance on miss musgrove there need not be least uneasiness leaving her mrs harville s care entirely mrs harville was very experienced nurse her nursery maid who had lived with her long gone about with her everywhere was just such another between these two she could want no possible attendance by day or night all this was said with truth sincerity feeling irresistible charles henrietta captain wentworth were three consultation for little while it was only interchange perplexity terror uppercross necessity some one s going uppercross news be conveyed how it could be broken mr mrs musgrove lateness morning hour already gone since they ought have been off impossibility being tolerable time at first they were capable nothing more purpose than such exclamations but after while captain wentworth exerting himself said we must be decided without loss another minute every minute is valuable some one must resolve on being off for uppercross instantly musgrove either you or i must go charles agreed but declared his resolution not going away he would be as little incumbrance as possible captain mrs harville but as leaving his sister such state he neither ought nor would so far it was decided henrietta at first declared same she however was soon persuaded think differently usefulness her staying she who had not been able remain louisa s room or look at her without sufferings which made her worse than helpless she was forced acknowledge that she could do no good yet was still unwilling be away till touched by thought her father mother she gave it up she consented she was anxious be at home plan had reached this point when anne coming quietly down from louisa s room could not but hear what followed for parlour door was open then it is settled musgrove cried captain wentworth that you stay that i take care your sister home but as rest as others if one stays assist mrs harville i think it need be only one mrs charles musgrove will course wish get back her children but if anne will stay no one so proper so capable as anne she paused moment recover from emotion hearing herself so spoken other two warmly agreed with what he said she then appeared you will stay i am sure you will stay nurse her cried he turning her speaking with glow yet gentleness which seemed almost restoring past she coloured deeply he recollected himself moved away she expressed herself most willing ready happy remain it was what she had been thinking wishing be allowed do bed on floor louisa s room would be sufficient for her if mrs harville would but think so one thing more all seemed arranged though it was rather desirable that mr mrs musgrove should be previously alarmed by some share delay yet time required by uppercross horses take them back would be dreadful extension suspense captain wentworth proposed charles musgrove agreed that it would be much better for him take chaise from inn leave mr musgrove s carriage horses be sent home next morning early when there would be farther advantage sending account louisa s night captain wentworth now hurried off get everything ready on his part be soon followed by two ladies when plan was made known mary however there was end all peace it she was so wretched so vehement complained so much injustice being expected go away instead anne anne who was nothing louisa while she was her sister had best right stay henrietta s stead why was not she be as useful as anne go home without charles too without her husband no it was too unkind short she said more than her husband could long withstand as none others could oppose when he gave way there was no help for it change mary for anne was inevitable anne had never submitted more reluctantly jealous ill judging claims mary but so it must be they set off for town charles taking care his sister captain benwick attending her she gave moment s recollection as they hurried along little circumstances which same spots had witnessed earlier morning there she had listened henrietta s schemes for dr shirley s leaving uppercross farther on she had first seen mr elliot moment seemed all that could now be given any one but louisa or those who were wrapped up her welfare captain benwick was most considerately attentive her united as they all seemed by distress day she felt increasing degree good will towards him pleasure even thinking that it might perhaps be occasion continuing their acquaintance captain wentworth was on watch for them chaise four waiting stationed for their convenience lowest part street but his evident surprise vexation at substitution one sister for other change his countenance astonishment expressions begun suppressed with which charles was listened made but mortifying reception anne or must at least convince her that she was valued only as she could be useful louisa she endeavoured be composed be just without emulating feelings emma towards her henry she would have attended on louisa with zeal above common claims regard for his sake she hoped he would not long be so unjust as suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from office friend meanwhile she was carriage he had handed them both placed himself between them this manner under these circumstances full astonishment emotion anne she quitted lyme how long stage would pass how it was affect their manners what was be their sort intercourse she could not foresee it was all quite natural however he was devoted henrietta always turning towards her when he spoke at all always with view supporting her hopes raising her spirits general his voice manner were studiously calm spare henrietta from agitation seemed governing principle once only when she had been grieving over last ill judged ill fated walk cobb bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought he burst forth as if wholly overcome don t talk it don t talk it he cried oh god that i had not given way her at fatal moment had i done as i ought but so eager so resolute dear sweet louisa anne wondered whether it ever occurred him now question justness his own previous opinion as universal felicity advantage firmness character whether it might not strike him that like all other qualities mind it should have its proportions limits she thought it could scarcely escape him feel that persuadable temper might sometimes be as much favour happiness as very resolute character they got on fast anne was astonished recognise same hills same objects so soon their actual speed heightened by some dread conclusion made road appear but half as long as on day before it was growing quite dusk however before they were neighbourhood uppercross there had been total silence among them for some time henrietta leaning back corner with shawl over her face giving hope her having cried herself sleep when as they were going up their last hill anne found herself all at once addressed by captain wentworth low cautious voice he said i have been considering what we had best do she must not appear at first she could not stand it i have been thinking whether you had not better remain carriage with her while i go break it mr mrs musgrove do you think this is good plan she did he was satisfied said no more but remembrance appeal remained pleasure her as proof friendship deference for her judgement great pleasure when it became sort parting proof its value did not lessen when distressing communication at uppercross was over he had seen father mother quite as composed as could be hoped daughter all better for being with them he announced his intention returning same carriage lyme when horses were baited he was off end volume one chapter xiii remainder anne s time at uppercross comprehending only two days was spent entirely at mansion house she had satisfaction knowing herself extremely useful there both as immediate companion as assisting all those arrangements for future which mr mrs musgrove s distressed state spirits would have been difficulties they had early account from lyme next morning louisa was much same no symptoms worse than before had appeared charles came few hours afterwards bring later more particular account he was tolerably cheerful speedy cure must not be hoped but everything was going on as well as nature case admitted speaking harvilles he seemed unable satisfy his own sense their kindness especially mrs harville s exertions as nurse she really left nothing for mary do he mary had been persuaded go early their inn last night mary had been hysterical again this morning when he came away she was going walk out with captain benwick which he hoped would do her good he almost wished she had been prevailed on come home day before but truth was that mrs harville left nothing for anybody do charles was return lyme same afternoon his father had at first half mind go with him but ladies could not consent it would be going only multiply trouble others increase his own distress much better scheme followed was acted upon chaise was sent for from crewkherne charles conveyed back far more useful person old nursery maid family one who having brought up all children seen very last lingering long petted master harry sent school after his brothers was now living her deserted nursery mend stockings dress all blains bruises she could get near her who consequently was only too happy being allowed go help nurse dear miss louisa vague wishes getting sarah thither had occurred before mrs musgrove henrietta but without anne it would hardly have been resolved on found practicable so soon they were indebted next day charles hayter for all minute knowledge louisa which it was so essential obtain every twenty four hours he made it his business go lyme his account was still encouraging intervals sense consciousness were believed be stronger every report agreed captain wentworth s appearing fixed lyme anne was leave them on morrow event which they all dreaded what should they do without her they were wretched comforters for one another so much was said this way that anne thought she could not do better than impart among them general inclination which she was privy persuaded them all go lyme at once she had little difficulty it was soon determined that they would go go morrow fix themselves at inn or get into lodgings as it suited there remain till dear louisa could be moved they must be taking off some trouble from good people she was with they might at least relieve mrs harville from care her own children short they were so happy decision that anne was delighted with what she had done felt that she could not spend her last morning at uppercross better than assisting their preparations sending them off at early hour though her being left solitary range house was consequence she was last excepting little boys at cottage she was very last only remaining one all that had filled animated both houses all that had given uppercross its cheerful character few days had made change indeed if louisa recovered it would all be well again more than former happiness would be restored there could not be doubt her mind there was none what would follow her recovery few months hence room now so deserted occupied but by her silent pensive self might be filled again with all that was happy gay all that was glowing bright prosperous love all that was most unlike anne elliot hour s complete leisure for such reflections as these on dark november day small thick rain almost blotting out very few objects ever be discerned from windows was enough make sound lady russell s carriage exceedingly welcome yet though desirous be gone she could not quit mansion house or look adieu cottage with its black dripping comfortless veranda or even notice through misty glasses last humble tenements village without saddened heart scenes had passed uppercross which made it precious it stood record many sensations pain once severe but now softened some instances relenting feeling some breathings friendship reconciliation which could never be looked for again which could never cease be dear she left it all behind her all but recollection that such things had been anne had never entered kellynch since her quitting lady russell s house september it had not been necessary few occasions its being possible for her go hall she had contrived evade escape from her first return was resume her place modern elegant apartments lodge gladden eyes its mistress there was some anxiety mixed with lady russell s joy meeting her she knew who had been frequenting uppercross but happily either anne was improved plumpness looks or lady russell fancied her so anne receiving her compliments on occasion had amusement connecting them with silent admiration her cousin hoping that she was be blessed with second spring youth beauty when they came converse she was soon sensible some mental change subjects which her heart had been full on leaving kellynch which she had felt slighted been compelled smother among musgroves were now become but secondary interest she had lately lost sight even her father sister bath their concerns had been sunk under those uppercross when lady russell reverted their former hopes fears spoke her satisfaction house camden place which had been taken her regret that mrs clay should still be with them anne would have been ashamed have it known how much more she was thinking lyme louisa musgrove all her acquaintance there how much more interesting her was home friendship harvilles captain benwick than her own father s house camden place or her own sister s intimacy with mrs clay she was actually forced exert herself meet lady russell with anything like appearance equal solicitude on topics which had by nature first claim on her there was little awkwardness at first their discourse on another subject they must speak accident at lyme lady russell had not been arrived five minutes day before when full account whole had burst on her but still it must be talked she must make enquiries she must regret imprudence lament result captain wentworth s name must be mentioned by both anne was conscious not doing it so well as lady russell she could not speak name look straight forward lady russell s eye till she had adopted expedient telling her briefly what she thought attachment between him louisa when this was told his name distressed her no longer lady russell had only listen composedly wish them happy but internally her heart revelled angry pleasure pleased contempt that man who at twenty three had seemed understand somewhat value anne elliot should eight years afterwards be charmed by louisa musgrove first three or four days passed most quietly with no circumstance mark them excepting receipt note or two from lyme which found their way anne she could not tell how brought rather improving account louisa at end that period lady russell s politeness could repose no longer fainter self threatenings past became decided tone i must call on mrs croft i really must call upon her soon anne have you courage go with me pay visit that house it will be some trial us both anne did not shrink from it on contrary she truly felt as she said observing i think you are very likely suffer most two your feelings are less reconciled change than mine by remaining neighbourhood i am become inured it she could have said more on subject for she had fact so high opinion crofts considered her father so very fortunate his tenants felt parish be so sure good example poor best attention relief that however sorry ashamed for necessity removal she could not but conscience feel that they were gone who deserved not stay that kellynch hall had passed into better hands than its owners these convictions must unquestionably have their own pain severe was its kind but they precluded that pain which lady russell would suffer entering house again returning through well known apartments such moments anne had no power saying herself these rooms ought belong only us oh how fallen their destination how unworthily occupied ancient family be so driven away strangers filling their place no except when she thought her mother remembered where she had been used sit preside she had no sigh that description heave mrs croft always met her with kindness which gave her pleasure fancying herself favourite on present occasion receiving her that house there was particular attention sad accident at lyme was soon prevailing topic on comparing their latest accounts invalid it appeared that each lady dated her intelligence from same hour yestermorn that captain wentworth had been kellynch yesterday first time since accident had brought anne last note which she had not been able trace exact steps had staid few hours then returned again lyme without any present intention quitting it any more he had enquired after her she found particularly had expressed his hope miss elliot s not being worse for her exertions had spoken those exertions as great this was handsome gave her more pleasure than almost anything else could have done as sad catastrophe itself it could be canvassed only one style by couple steady sensible women whose judgements had work on ascertained events it was perfectly decided that it had been consequence much thoughtlessness much imprudence that its effects were most alarming that it was frightful think how long miss musgrove s recovery might yet be doubtful how liable she would still remain suffer from concussion hereafter admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming ay very bad business indeed new sort way this for young fellow be making love by breaking his mistress s head is not it miss elliot this is breaking head giving plaster truly admiral croft s manners were not quite tone suit lady russell but they delighted anne his goodness heart simplicity character were irresistible now this must be very bad for you said he suddenly rousing from little reverie be coming finding us here i had not recollected it before i declare but it must be very bad but now do not stand upon ceremony get up go over all rooms house if you like it another time sir i thank you not now well whenever it suits you you can slip from shrubbery at any time there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up by that door good place is not it but checking himself you will not think it good place for yours were always kept butler s room ay so it always is i believe one man s ways may be as good as another s but we all like our own best so you must judge for yourself whether it would be better for you go about house or not anne finding she might decline it did so very gratefully we have made very few changes either continued admiral after thinking moment very few we told you about laundry door at uppercross that has been very great improvement wonder was how any family upon earth could bear with inconvenience its opening as it did so long you will tell sir walter what we have done that mr shepherd thinks it greatest improvement house ever had indeed i must do ourselves justice say that few alterations we have made have been all very much for better my wife should have credit them however i have done very little besides sending away some large looking glasses from my dressing room which was your father s very good man very much gentleman i am sure but i should think miss elliot looking with serious reflection i should think he must be rather dressy man for his time life such number looking glasses oh lord there was no getting away from one s self so i got sophy lend me hand we soon shifted their quarters now i am quite snug with my little shaving glass one corner another great thing that i never go near anne amused spite herself was rather distressed for answer admiral fearing he might not have been civil enough took up subject again say next time you write your good father miss elliot pray give him my compliments mrs croft s say that we are settled here quite our liking have no fault at all find with place breakfast room chimney smokes little i grant you but it is only when wind is due north blows hard which may not happen three times winter take it altogether now that we have been into most houses hereabouts can judge there is not one that we like better than this pray say so with my compliments he will be glad hear it lady russell mrs croft were very well pleased with each other but acquaintance which this visit began was fated not proceed far at present for when it was returned crofts announced themselves be going away for few weeks visit their connexions north county probably might not be at home again before lady russell would be removing bath so ended all danger anne meeting captain wentworth at kellynch hall or seeing him company with her friend everything was safe enough she smiled over many anxious feelings she had wasted on subject chapter xiv though charles mary had remained at lyme much longer after mr mrs musgrove s going than anne conceived they could have been at all wanted they were yet first family be at home again as soon as possible after their return uppercross they drove over lodge they had left louisa beginning sit up but her head though clear was exceedingly weak her nerves susceptible highest extreme tenderness though she might be pronounced be altogether doing very well it was still impossible say when she might be able bear removal home her father mother who must return time receive their younger children for christmas holidays had hardly hope being allowed bring her with them they had been all lodgings together mrs musgrove had got mrs harville s children away as much as she could every possible supply from uppercross had been furnished lighten inconvenience harvilles while harvilles had been wanting them come dinner every day short it seemed have been only struggle on each side as which should be most disinterested hospitable mary had had her evils but upon whole as was evident by her staying so long she had found more enjoy than suffer charles hayter had been at lyme oftener than suited her when they dined with harvilles there had been only maid servant wait at first mrs harville had always given mrs musgrove precedence but then she had received so very handsome apology from her on finding out whose daughter she was there had been so much going on every day there had been so many walks between their lodgings harvilles she had got books from library changed them so often that balance had certainly been much favour lyme she had been taken charmouth too she had bathed she had gone church there were great many more people look at church at lyme than at uppercross all this joined sense being so very useful had made really agreeable fortnight anne enquired after captain benwick mary s face was clouded directly charles laughed oh captain benwick is very well i believe but he is very odd young man i do not know what he would be at we asked him come home with us for day or two charles undertook give him some shooting he seemed quite delighted for my part i thought it was all settled when behold on tuesday night he made very awkward sort excuse he never shot he had been quite misunderstood he had promised this he had promised that end it was i found that he did not mean come i suppose he was afraid finding it dull but upon my word i should have thought we were lively enough at cottage for such heart broken man as captain benwick charles laughed again said now mary you know very well how it really was it was all your doing turning anne he fancied that if he went with us he should find you close by he fancied everybody be living uppercross when he discovered that lady russell lived three miles off his heart failed him he had not courage come that is fact upon my honour mary knows it is but mary did not give into it very graciously whether from not considering captain benwick entitled by birth situation be love with elliot or from not wanting believe anne greater attraction uppercross than herself must be left be guessed anne s good will however was not be lessened by what she heard she boldly acknowledged herself flattered continued her enquiries oh he talks you cried charles such terms mary interrupted him i declare charles i never heard him mention anne twice all time i was there i declare anne he never talks you at all no admitted charles i do not know that he ever does general way but however it is very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly his head is full some books that he is reading upon your recommendation he wants talk you about them he has found out something or other one them which he thinks oh i cannot pretend remember it but it was something very fine i overheard him telling henrietta all about it then miss elliot was spoken highest terms now mary i declare it was so i heard it myself you were other room elegance sweetness beauty oh there was no end miss elliot s charms i am sure cried mary warmly it was very little his credit if he did miss harville only died last june such heart is very little worth having is it lady russell i am sure you will agree with me i must see captain benwick before i decide said lady russell smiling that you are very likely do very soon i can tell you ma am said charles though he had not nerves for coming away with us setting off again afterwards pay formal visit here he will make his way over kellynch one day by himself you may depend on it i told him distance road i told him church s being so very well worth seeing for as he has taste for those sort things i thought that would be good excuse he listened with all his understanding soul i am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon so i give you notice lady russell any acquaintance anne s will always be welcome me was lady russell s kind answer oh as being anne s acquaintance said mary i think he is rather my acquaintance for i have been seeing him every day this last fortnight well as your joint acquaintance then i shall be very happy see captain benwick you will not find anything very agreeable him i assure you ma am he is one dullest young men that ever lived he has walked with me sometimes from one end sands other without saying word he is not at all well bred young man i am sure you will not like him there we differ mary said anne i think lady russell would like him i think she would be so much pleased with his mind that she would very soon see no deficiency his manner so do i anne said charles i am sure lady russell would like him he is just lady russell s sort give him book he will read all day long yes that he will exclaimed mary tauntingly he will sit poring over his book not know when person speaks him or when one drops one s scissors or anything that happens do you think lady russell would like that lady russell could not help laughing upon my word said she i should not have supposed that my opinion any one could have admitted such difference conjecture steady matter fact as i may call myself i have really curiosity see person who can give occasion such directly opposite notions i wish he may be induced call here when he does mary you may depend upon hearing my opinion but i am determined not judge him beforehand you will not like him i will answer for it lady russell began talking something else mary spoke with animation their meeting with or rather missing mr elliot so extraordinarily he is man said lady russell whom i have no wish see his declining be on cordial terms with head his family has left very strong impression his disfavour with me this decision checked mary s eagerness stopped her short midst elliot countenance with regard captain wentworth though anne hazarded no enquiries there was voluntary communication sufficient his spirits had been greatly recovering lately as might be expected as louisa improved he had improved he was now quite different creature from what he had been first week he had not seen louisa was so extremely fearful any ill consequence her from interview that he did not press for it at all on contrary seemed have plan going away for week or ten days till her head was stronger he had talked going down plymouth for week wanted persuade captain benwick go with him but as charles maintained last captain benwick seemed much more disposed ride over kellynch there can be no doubt that lady russell anne were both occasionally thinking captain benwick from this time lady russell could not hear door bell without feeling that it might be his herald nor could anne return from any stroll solitary indulgence her father s grounds or any visit charity village without wondering whether she might see him or hear him captain benwick came not however he was either less disposed for it than charles had imagined or he was too shy after giving him week s indulgence lady russell determined him be unworthy interest which he had been beginning excite musgroves came back receive their happy boys girls from school bringing with them mrs harville s little children improve noise uppercross lessen that lyme henrietta remained with louisa but all rest family were again their usual quarters lady russell anne paid their compliments them once when anne could not but feel that uppercross was already quite alive again though neither henrietta nor louisa nor charles hayter nor captain wentworth were there room presented as strong contrast as could be wished last state she had seen it immediately surrounding mrs musgrove were little harvilles whom she was sedulously guarding from tyranny two children from cottage expressly arrived amuse them on one side was table occupied by some chattering girls cutting up silk gold paper on other were tressels trays bending under weight brawn cold pies where riotous boys were holding high revel whole completed by roaring christmas fire which seemed determined be heard spite all noise others charles mary also came course during their visit mr musgrove made point paying his respects lady russell sat down close her for ten minutes talking with very raised voice but from clamour children on his knees generally vain it was fine family piece anne judging from her own temperament would have deemed such domestic hurricane bad restorative nerves which louisa s illness must have so greatly shaken but mrs musgrove who got anne near her on purpose thank her most cordially again again for all her attentions them concluded short recapitulation what she had suffered herself by observing with happy glance round room that after all she had gone through nothing was so likely do her good as little quiet cheerfulness at home louisa was now recovering apace her mother could even think her being able join their party at home before her brothers sisters went school again harvilles had promised come with her stay at uppercross whenever she returned captain wentworth was gone for present see his brother shropshire i hope i shall remember future said lady russell as soon as they were reseated carriage not call at uppercross christmas holidays everybody has their taste noises as well as other matters sounds are quite innoxious or most distressing by their sort rather than their quantity when lady russell not long afterwards was entering bath on wet afternoon driving through long course streets from old bridge camden place amidst dash other carriages heavy rumble carts drays bawling newspapermen muffin men milkmen ceaseless clink pattens she made no complaint no these were noises which belonged winter pleasures her spirits rose under their influence like mrs musgrove she was feeling though not saying that after being long country nothing could be so good for her as little quiet cheerfulness anne did not share these feelings she persisted very determined though very silent disinclination for bath caught first dim view extensive buildings smoking rain without any wish seeing them better felt their progress through streets be however disagreeable yet too rapid for who would be glad see her when she arrived looked back with fond regret bustles uppercross seclusion kellynch elizabeth s last letter had communicated piece news some interest mr elliot was bath he had called camden place had called second time third had been pointedly attentive if elizabeth her father did not deceive themselves had been taking much pains seek acquaintance proclaim value connection as he had formerly taken pains shew neglect this was very wonderful if it were true lady russell was state very agreeable curiosity perplexity about mr elliot already recanting sentiment she had so lately expressed mary his being man whom she had no wish see she had great wish see him if he really sought reconcile himself like dutiful branch he must be forgiven for having dismembered himself from paternal tree anne was not animated equal pitch by circumstance but she felt that she would rather see mr elliot again than not which was more than she could say for many other persons bath she was put down camden place lady russell then drove her own lodgings rivers street chapter xv sir walter had taken very good house camden place lofty dignified situation such as becomes man consequence both he elizabeth were settled there much their satisfaction anne entered it with sinking heart anticipating imprisonment many months anxiously saying herself oh when shall i leave you again degree unexpected cordiality however welcome she received did her good her father sister were glad see her for sake shewing her house furniture met her with kindness her making fourth when they sat down dinner was noticed as advantage mrs clay was very pleasant very smiling but her courtesies smiles were more matter course anne had always felt that she would pretend what was proper on her arrival but complaisance others was unlooked for they were evidently excellent spirits she was soon listen causes they had no inclination listen her after laying out for some compliments being deeply regretted their old neighbourhood which anne could not pay they had only few faint enquiries make before talk must be all their own uppercross excited no interest kellynch very little it was all bath they had pleasure assuring her that bath more than answered their expectations every respect their house was undoubtedly best camden place their drawing rooms had many decided advantages over all others which they had either seen or heard superiority was not less style fitting up or taste furniture their acquaintance was exceedingly sought after everybody was wanting visit them they had drawn back from many introductions still were perpetually having cards left by people whom they knew nothing here were funds enjoyment could anne wonder that her father sister were happy she might not wonder but she must sigh that her father should feel no degradation his change should see nothing regret duties dignity resident landholder should find so much be vain littlenesses town she must sigh smile wonder too as elizabeth threw open folding doors walked with exultation from one drawing room other boasting their space at possibility that woman who had been mistress kellynch hall finding extent be proud between two walls perhaps thirty feet asunder but this was not all which they had make them happy they had mr elliot too anne had great deal hear mr elliot he was not only pardoned they were delighted with him he had been bath about fortnight he had passed through bath november his way london when intelligence sir walter s being settled there had course reached him though only twenty four hours place but he had not been able avail himself it but he had now been fortnight bath his first object on arriving had been leave his card camden place following it up by such assiduous endeavours meet when they did meet by such great openness conduct such readiness apologize for past such solicitude be received as relation again that their former good understanding was completely re established they had not fault find him he had explained away all appearance neglect on his own side it had originated misapprehension entirely he had never had idea throwing himself off he had feared that he was thrown off but knew not why delicacy had kept him silent upon hint having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly family family honours he was quite indignant he who had ever boasted being elliot whose feelings as connection were only too strict suit unfeudal tone present day he was astonished indeed but his character general conduct must refute it he could refer sir walter all who knew him certainly pains he had been taking on this first opportunity reconciliation be restored footing relation heir presumptive was strong proof his opinions on subject circumstances his marriage too were found admit much extenuation this was article not be entered on by himself but very intimate friend his colonel wallis highly respectable man perfectly gentleman not ill looking man sir walter added who was living very good style marlborough buildings had at his own particular request been admitted their acquaintance through mr elliot had mentioned one or two things relative marriage which made material difference discredit it colonel wallis had known mr elliot long had been well acquainted also with his wife had perfectly understood whole story she was certainly not woman family but well educated accomplished rich excessively love with his friend there had been charm she had sought him without that attraction not all her money would have tempted elliot sir walter was moreover assured her having been very fine woman here was great deal soften business very fine woman with large fortune love with him sir walter seemed admit it as complete apology though elizabeth could not see circumstance quite so favourable light she allowed it be great extenuation mr elliot had called repeatedly had dined with them once evidently delighted by distinction being asked for they gave no dinners general delighted short by every proof cousinly notice placing his whole happiness being on intimate terms camden place anne listened but without quite understanding it allowances large allowances she knew must be made for ideas those who spoke she heard it all under embellishment all that sounded extravagant or irrational progress reconciliation might have no origin but language relators still however she had sensation there being something more than immediately appeared mr elliot s wishing after interval so many years be well received by them worldly view he had nothing gain by being on terms with sir walter nothing risk by state variance all probability he was already richer two kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as title sensible man he had looked like very sensible man why should it be object him she could only offer one solution it was perhaps for elizabeth s sake there might really have been liking formerly though convenience accident had drawn him different way now that he could afford please himself he might mean pay his addresses her elizabeth was certainly very handsome with well bred elegant manners her character might never have been penetrated by mr elliot knowing her but public when very young himself how her temper understanding might bear investigation his present keener time life was another concern rather fearful one most earnestly did she wish that he might not be too nice or too observant if elizabeth were his object that elizabeth was disposed believe herself so that her friend mrs clay was encouraging idea seemed apparent by glance or two between them while mr elliot s frequent visits were talked anne mentioned glimpses she had had him at lyme but without being much attended oh yes perhaps it had been mr elliot they did not know it might be him perhaps they could not listen her description him they were describing him themselves sir walter especially he did justice his very gentlemanlike appearance his air elegance fashion his good shaped face his sensible eye but at same time must lament his being very much under hung defect which time seemed have increased nor could he pretend say that ten years had not altered almost every feature for worse mr elliot appeared think that he sir walter was looking exactly as he had done when they last parted but sir walter had not been able return compliment entirely which had embarrassed him he did not mean complain however mr elliot was better look at than most men he had no objection being seen with him anywhere mr elliot his friends marlborough buildings were talked whole evening colonel wallis had been so impatient be introduced them mr elliot so anxious that he should there was mrs wallis at present known only them by description as she was daily expectation her confinement but mr elliot spoke her as most charming woman quite worthy being known camden place as soon as she recovered they were be acquainted sir walter thought much mrs wallis she was said be excessively pretty woman beautiful he longed see her he hoped she might make some amends for many very plain faces he was continually passing streets worst bath was number its plain women he did not mean say that there were no pretty women but number plain was out all proportion he had frequently observed as he walked that one handsome face would be followed by thirty or five thirty frights once as he had stood shop on bond street he had counted eighty seven women go by one after another without there being tolerable face among them it had been frosty morning be sure sharp frost which hardly one woman thousand could stand test but still there certainly were dreadful multitude ugly women bath as for men they were infinitely worse such scarecrows as streets were full it was evident how little women were used sight anything tolerable by effect which man decent appearance produced he had never walked anywhere arm arm with colonel wallis who was fine military figure though sandy haired without observing that every woman s eye was upon him every woman s eye was sure be upon colonel wallis modest sir walter he was not allowed escape however his daughter mrs clay united hinting that colonel wallis s companion might have as good figure as colonel wallis certainly was not sandy haired how is mary looking said sir walter height his good humour last time i saw her she had red nose but i hope that may not happen every day oh no that must have been quite accidental general she has been very good health very good looks since michaelmas if i thought it would not tempt her go out sharp winds grow coarse i would send her new hat pelisse anne was considering whether she should venture suggest that gown or cap would not be liable any such misuse when knock at door suspended everything knock at door so late it was ten o clock could it be mr elliot they knew he was dine lansdown crescent it was possible that he might stop his way home ask them how they did they could think no one else mrs clay decidedly thought it mr elliot s knock mrs clay was right with all state which butler foot boy could give mr elliot was ushered into room it was same very same man with no difference but dress anne drew little back while others received his compliments her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual hour but he could not be so near without wishing know that neither she nor her friend had taken cold day before c c which was all as politely done as politely taken as possible but her part must follow then sir walter talked his youngest daughter mr elliot must give him leave present him his youngest daughter there was no occasion for remembering mary anne smiling blushing very becomingly shewed mr elliot pretty features which he had by no means forgotten instantly saw with amusement at his little start surprise that he had not been at all aware who she was he looked completely astonished but not more astonished than pleased his eyes brightened with most perfect alacrity he welcomed relationship alluded past entreated be received as acquaintance already he was quite as good looking as he had appeared at lyme his countenance improved by speaking his manners were so exactly what they ought be so polished so easy so particularly agreeable that she could compare them excellence only one person s manners they were not same but they were perhaps equally good he sat down with them improved their conversation very much there could be no doubt his being sensible man ten minutes were enough certify that his tone his expressions his choice subject his knowing where stop it was all operation sensible discerning mind as soon as he could he began talk her lyme wanting compare opinions respecting place but especially wanting speak circumstance their happening be guests same inn at same time give his own route understand something hers regret that he should have lost such opportunity paying his respects her she gave him short account her party business at lyme his regret increased as he listened he had spent his whole solitary evening room adjoining theirs had heard voices mirth continually thought they must be most delightful set people longed be with them but certainly without smallest suspicion his possessing shadow right introduce himself if he had but asked who party were name musgrove would have told him enough well it would serve cure him absurd practice never asking question at inn which he had adopted when quite young man on principle its being very ungenteel be curious notions young man one or two twenty said he as what is necessary manners make him quite thing are more absurd i believe than those any other set beings world folly means they often employ is only be equalled by folly what they have view but he must not be addressing his reflections anne alone he knew it he was soon diffused again among others it was only at intervals that he could return lyme his enquiries however produced at length account scene she had been engaged there soon after his leaving place having alluded accident he must hear whole when he questioned sir walter elizabeth began question also but difference their manner doing it could not be unfelt she could only compare mr elliot lady russell wish really comprehending what had passed degree concern for what she must have suffered witnessing it he staid hour with them elegant little clock on mantel piece had struck eleven with its silver sounds watchman was beginning be heard at distance telling same tale before mr elliot or any them seemed feel that he had been there long anne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening camden place could have passed so well chapter xvi there was one point which anne on returning her family would have been more thankful ascertain even than mr elliot s being love with elizabeth which was her father s not being love with mrs clay she was very far from easy about it when she had been at home few hours on going down breakfast next morning she found there had just been decent pretence on lady s side meaning leave them she could imagine mrs clay have said that now miss anne was come she could not suppose herself at all wanted for elizabeth was replying sort whisper that must not be any reason indeed i assure you i feel it none she is nothing me compared with you she was full time hear her father say my dear madam this must not be as yet you have seen nothing bath you have been here only be useful you must not run away from us now you must stay be acquainted with mrs wallis beautiful mrs wallis your fine mind i well know sight beauty is real gratification he spoke looked so much earnest that anne was not surprised see mrs clay stealing glance at elizabeth herself her countenance perhaps might express some watchfulness but praise fine mind did not appear excite thought her sister lady could not but yield such joint entreaties promise stay course same morning anne her father chancing be alone together he began compliment her on her improved looks he thought her less thin her person her cheeks her skin her complexion greatly improved clearer fresher had she been using any thing particular no nothing merely gowland he supposed no nothing at all ha he was surprised at that added certainly you cannot do better than continue as you are you cannot be better than well or i should recommend gowland constant use gowland during spring months mrs clay has been using it at my recommendation you see what it has done for her you see how it has carried away her freckles if elizabeth could but have heard this such personal praise might have struck her especially as it did not appear anne that freckles were at all lessened but everything must take its chance evil marriage would be much diminished if elizabeth were also marry as for herself she might always command home with lady russell lady russell s composed mind polite manners were put some trial on this point her intercourse camden place sight mrs clay such favour anne so overlooked was perpetual provocation her there vexed her as much when she was away as person bath who drinks water gets all new publications has very large acquaintance has time be vexed as mr elliot became known her she grew more charitable or more indifferent towards others his manners were immediate recommendation on conversing with him she found solid so fully supporting superficial that she was at first as she told anne almost ready exclaim can this be mr elliot could not seriously picture herself more agreeable or estimable man everything united him good understanding correct opinions knowledge world warm heart he had strong feelings family attachment family honour without pride or weakness he lived with liberality man fortune without display he judged for himself everything essential without defying public opinion any point worldly decorum he was steady observant moderate candid never run away with by spirits or by selfishness which fancied itself strong feeling yet with sensibility what was amiable lovely value for all felicities domestic life which characters fancied enthusiasm violent agitation seldom really possess she was sure that he had not been happy marriage colonel wallis said it lady russell saw it but it had been no unhappiness sour his mind nor she began pretty soon suspect prevent his thinking second choice her satisfaction mr elliot outweighed all plague mrs clay it was now some years since anne had begun learn that she her excellent friend could sometimes think differently it did not surprise her therefore that lady russell should see nothing suspicious or inconsistent nothing require more motives than appeared mr elliot s great desire reconciliation lady russell s view it was perfectly natural that mr elliot at mature time life should feel it most desirable object what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people be on good terms with head his family simplest process world time upon head naturally clear only erring heyday youth anne presumed however still smile about it at last mention elizabeth lady russell listened looked made only this cautious reply elizabeth very well time will explain it was reference future which anne after little observation felt she must submit she could determine nothing at present that house elizabeth must be first she was habit such general observance as miss elliot that any particularity attention seemed almost impossible mr elliot too it must be remembered had not been widower seven months little delay on his side might be very excusable fact anne could never see crape round his hat without fearing that she was inexcusable one attributing him such imaginations for though his marriage had not been very happy still it had existed so many years that she could not comprehend very rapid recovery from awful impression its being dissolved however it might end he was without any question their pleasantest acquaintance bath she saw nobody equal him it was great indulgence now then talk him about lyme which he seemed have as lively wish see again see more as herself they went through particulars their first meeting great many times he gave her understand that he had looked at her with some earnestness she knew it well she remembered another person s look also they did not always think alike his value for rank connexion she perceived was greater than hers it was not merely complaisance it must be liking cause which made him enter warmly into her father sister s solicitudes on subject which she thought unworthy excite them bath paper one morning announced arrival dowager viscountess dalrymple her daughter honourable miss carteret all comfort no camden place was swept away for many days for dalrymples anne s opinion most unfortunately were cousins elliots agony was how introduce themselves properly anne had never seen her father sister before contact with nobility she must acknowledge herself disappointed she had hoped better things from their high ideas their own situation life was reduced form wish which she had never foreseen wish that they had more pride for our cousins lady dalrymple miss carteret our cousins dalrymples sounded her ears all day long sir walter had once been company with late viscount but had never seen any rest family difficulties case arose from there having been suspension all intercourse by letters ceremony ever since death that said late viscount when consequence dangerous illness sir walter s at same time there had been unlucky omission at kellynch no letter condolence had been sent ireland neglect had been visited on head sinner for when poor lady elliot died herself no letter condolence was received at kellynch consequently there was but too much reason apprehend that dalrymples considered relationship as closed how have this anxious business set rights be admitted as cousins again was question it was question which more rational manner neither lady russell nor mr elliot thought unimportant family connexions were always worth preserving good company always worth seeking lady dalrymple had taken house for three months laura place would be living style she had been at bath year before lady russell had heard her spoken as charming woman it was very desirable that connexion should be renewed if it could be done without any compromise propriety on side elliots sir walter however would choose his own means at last wrote very fine letter ample explanation regret entreaty his right honourable cousin neither lady russell nor mr elliot could admire letter but it did all that was wanted bringing three lines scrawl from dowager viscountess she was very much honoured should be happy their acquaintance toils business were over sweets began they visited laura place they had cards dowager viscountess dalrymple honourable miss carteret be arranged wherever they might be most visible our cousins laura place our cousin lady dalrymple miss carteret were talked everybody anne was ashamed had lady dalrymple her daughter even been very agreeable she would still have been ashamed agitation they created but they were nothing there was no superiority manner accomplishment or understanding lady dalrymple had acquired name charming woman because she had smile civil answer for everybody miss carteret with still less say was so plain so awkward that she would never have been tolerated camden place but for her birth lady russell confessed she had expected something better but yet it was acquaintance worth having when anne ventured speak her opinion them mr elliot he agreed their being nothing themselves but still maintained that as family connexion as good company as those who would collect good company around them they had their value anne smiled said my idea good company mr elliot is company clever well informed people who have great deal conversation that is what i call good company you are mistaken said he gently that is not good company that is best good company requires only birth education manners with regard education is not very nice birth good manners are essential but little learning is by no means dangerous thing good company on contrary it will do very well my cousin anne shakes her head she is not satisfied she is fastidious my dear cousin sitting down by her you have better right be fastidious than almost any other woman i know but will it answer will it make you happy will it not be wiser accept society those good ladies laura place enjoy all advantages connexion as far as possible you may depend upon it that they will move first set bath this winter as rank is rank your being known be related them will have its use fixing your family our family let me say that degree consideration which we must all wish for yes sighed anne we shall indeed be known be related them then recollecting herself not wishing be answered she added i certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken procure acquaintance i suppose smiling i have more pride than any you but i confess it does vex me that we should be so solicitous have relationship acknowledged which we may be very sure is matter perfect indifference them pardon me dear cousin you are unjust your own claims london perhaps your present quiet style living it might be as you say but bath sir walter elliot his family will always be worth knowing always acceptable as acquaintance well said anne i certainly am proud too proud enjoy welcome which depends so entirely upon place i love your indignation said he it is very natural but here you are bath object is be established here with all credit dignity which ought belong sir walter elliot you talk being proud i am called proud i know i shall not wish believe myself otherwise for our pride if investigated would have same object i have no doubt though kind may seem little different one point i am sure my dear cousin he continued speaking lower though there was no one else room one point i am sure we must feel alike we must feel that every addition your father s society among his equals or superiors may be use diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him he looked as he spoke seat which mrs clay had been lately occupying sufficient explanation what he particularly meant though anne could not believe their having same sort pride she was pleased with him for not liking mrs clay her conscience admitted that his wishing promote her father s getting great acquaintance was more than excusable view defeating her chapter xvii while sir walter elizabeth were assiduously pushing their good fortune laura place anne was renewing acquaintance very different description she had called on her former governess had heard from her there being old schoolfellow bath who had two strong claims on her attention past kindness present suffering miss hamilton now mrs smith had shewn her kindness one those periods her life when it had been most valuable anne had gone unhappy school grieving for loss mother whom she had dearly loved feeling her separation from home suffering as girl fourteen strong sensibility not high spirits must suffer at such time miss hamilton three years older than herself but still from want near relations settled home remaining another year at school had been useful good her way which had considerably lessened her misery could never be remembered with indifference miss hamilton had left school had married not long afterwards was said have married man fortune this was all that anne had known her till now that their governess s account brought her situation forward more decided but very different form she was widow poor her husband had been extravagant at his death about two years before had left his affairs dreadfully involved she had had difficulties every sort contend with addition these distresses had been afflicted with severe rheumatic fever which finally settling her legs had made her for present cripple she had come bath on that account was now lodgings near hot baths living very humble way unable even afford herself comfort servant course almost excluded from society their mutual friend answered for satisfaction which visit from miss elliot would give mrs smith anne therefore lost no time going she mentioned nothing what she had heard or what she intended at home it would excite no proper interest there she only consulted lady russell who entered thoroughly into her sentiments was most happy convey her as near mrs smith s lodgings westgate buildings as anne chose be taken visit was paid their acquaintance re established their interest each other more than re kindled first ten minutes had its awkwardness its emotion twelve years were gone since they had parted each presented somewhat different person from what other had imagined twelve years had changed anne from blooming silent unformed girl fifteen elegant little woman seven twenty with every beauty except bloom with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle twelve years had transformed fine looking well grown miss hamilton all glow health confidence superiority into poor infirm helpless widow receiving visit her former protegee as favour but all that was uncomfortable meeting had soon passed away left only interesting charm remembering former partialities talking over old times anne found mrs smith good sense agreeable manners which she had almost ventured depend on disposition converse be cheerful beyond her expectation neither dissipations past she had lived very much world nor restrictions present neither sickness nor sorrow seemed have closed her heart or ruined her spirits course second visit she talked with great openness anne s astonishment increased she could scarcely imagine more cheerless situation itself than mrs smith s she had been very fond her husband she had buried him she had been used affluence it was gone she had no child connect her with life happiness again no relations assist arrangement perplexed affairs no health make all rest supportable her accommodations were limited noisy parlour dark bedroom behind with no possibility moving from one other without assistance which there was only one servant house afford she never quitted house but be conveyed into warm bath yet spite all this anne had reason believe that she had moments only languor depression hours occupation enjoyment how could it be she watched observed reflected finally determined that this was not case fortitude or resignation only submissive spirit might be patient strong understanding would supply resolution but here was something more here was that elasticity mind that disposition be comforted that power turning readily from evil good finding employment which carried her out herself which was from nature alone it was choicest gift heaven anne viewed her friend as one those instances which by merciful appointment it seems designed counterbalance almost every other want there had been time mrs smith told her when her spirits had nearly failed she could not call herself invalid now compared with her state on first reaching bath then she had indeed been pitiable object for she had caught cold on journey had hardly taken possession her lodgings before she was again confined her bed suffering under severe constant pain all this among strangers with absolute necessity having regular nurse finances at that moment particularly unfit meet any extraordinary expense she had weathered it however could truly say that it had done her good it had increased her comforts by making her feel herself be good hands she had seen too much world expect sudden or disinterested attachment anywhere but her illness had proved her that her landlady had character preserve would not use her ill she had been particularly fortunate her nurse as sister her landlady nurse by profession who had always home that house when unemployed chanced be at liberty just time attend her she said mrs smith besides nursing me most admirably has really proved invaluable acquaintance as soon as i could use my hands she taught me knit which has been great amusement she put me way making these little thread cases pin cushions card racks which you always find me so busy about which supply me with means doing little good one or two very poor families this neighbourhood she had large acquaintance course professionally among those who can afford buy she disposes my merchandise she always takes right time for applying everybody s heart is open you know when they have recently escaped from severe pain or are recovering blessing health nurse rooke thoroughly understands when speak she is shrewd intelligent sensible woman hers is line for seeing human nature she has fund good sense observation which as companion make her infinitely superior thousands those who having only received best education world know nothing worth attending call it gossip if you will but when nurse rooke has half hour s leisure bestow on me she is sure have something relate that is entertaining profitable something that makes one know one s species better one likes hear what is going on be au fait as newest modes being trifling silly me who live so much alone her conversation i assure you is treat anne far from wishing cavil at pleasure replied i can easily believe it women that class have great opportunities if they are intelligent may be well worth listening such varieties human nature as they are habit witnessing it is not merely its follies that they are well read for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting what instances must pass before them ardent disinterested self denying attachment heroism fortitude patience resignation all conflicts all sacrifices that ennoble us most sick chamber may often furnish worth volumes yes said mrs smith more doubtingly sometimes it may though i fear its lessons are not often elevated style you describe here there human nature may be great times trial but generally speaking it is its weakness not its strength that appears sick chamber it is selfishness impatience rather than generosity fortitude that one hears there is so little real friendship world unfortunately speaking low tremulously there are so many who forget think seriously till it is almost too late anne saw misery such feelings husband had not been what he ought wife had been led among that part mankind which made her think worse world than she hoped it deserved it was but passing emotion however with mrs smith she shook it off soon added different tone i do not suppose situation my friend mrs rooke is at present will furnish much either interest or edify me she is only nursing mrs wallis marlborough buildings mere pretty silly expensive fashionable woman i believe course will have nothing report but lace finery i mean make my profit mrs wallis however she has plenty money i intend she shall buy all high priced things i have hand now anne had called several times on her friend before existence such person was known camden place at last it became necessary speak her sir walter elizabeth mrs clay returned one morning from laura place with sudden invitation from lady dalrymple for same evening anne was already engaged spend that evening westgate buildings she was not sorry for excuse they were only asked she was sure because lady dalrymple being kept at home by bad cold was glad make use relationship which had been so pressed on her she declined on her own account with great alacrity she was engaged spend evening with old schoolfellow they were not much interested anything relative anne but still there were questions enough asked make it understood what this old schoolfellow was elizabeth was disdainful sir walter severe westgate buildings said he who is miss anne elliot be visiting westgate buildings mrs smith widow mrs smith who was her husband one five thousand mr smiths whose names are be met with everywhere what is her attraction that she is old sickly upon my word miss anne elliot you have most extraordinary taste everything that revolts other people low company paltry rooms foul air disgusting associations are inviting you but surely you may put off this old lady till morrow she is not so near her end i presume but that she may hope see another day what is her age forty no sir she is not one thirty but i do not think i can put off my engagement because it is only evening for some time which will at once suit her myself she goes into warm bath morrow for rest week you know we are engaged but what does lady russell think this acquaintance asked elizabeth she sees nothing blame it replied anne on contrary she approves it has generally taken me when i have called on mrs smith westgate buildings must have been rather surprised by appearance carriage drawn up near its pavement observed sir walter sir henry russell s widow indeed has no honours distinguish her arms but still it is handsome equipage no doubt is well known convey miss elliot widow mrs smith lodging westgate buildings poor widow barely able live between thirty forty mere mrs smith every day mrs smith all people all names world be chosen friend miss anne elliot be preferred by her her own family connections among nobility england ireland mrs smith such name mrs clay who had been present while all this passed now thought it advisable leave room anne could have said much did long say little defence her friend s not very dissimilar claims theirs but her sense personal respect her father prevented her she made no reply she left it himself recollect that mrs smith was not only widow bath between thirty forty with little live on no surname dignity anne kept her appointment others kept theirs course she heard next morning that they had had delightful evening she had been only one set absent for sir walter elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship s service themselves but had actually been happy be employed by her collecting others had been at trouble inviting both lady russell mr elliot mr elliot had made point leaving colonel wallis early lady russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements order wait on her anne had whole history all that such evening could supply from lady russell her its greatest interest must be having been very much talked between her friend mr elliot having been wished for regretted at same time honoured for staying away such cause her kind compassionate visits this old schoolfellow sick reduced seemed have quite delighted mr elliot he thought her most extraordinary young woman her temper manners mind model female excellence he could meet even lady russell discussion her merits anne could not be given understand so much by her friend could not know herself be so highly rated by sensible man without many those agreeable sensations which her friend meant create lady russell was now perfectly decided her opinion mr elliot she was as much convinced his meaning gain anne time as his deserving her was beginning calculate number weeks which would free him from all remaining restraints widowhood leave him at liberty exert his most open powers pleasing she would not speak anne with half certainty she felt on subject she would venture on little more than hints what might be hereafter possible attachment on his side desirableness alliance supposing such attachment be real returned anne heard her made no violent exclamations she only smiled blushed gently shook her head i am no match maker as you well know said lady russell being much too well aware uncertainty all human events calculations i only mean that if mr elliot should some time hence pay his addresses you if you should be disposed accept him i think there would be every possibility your being happy together most suitable connection everybody must consider it but i think it might be very happy one mr elliot is exceedingly agreeable man many respects i think highly him said anne but we should not suit lady russell let this pass only said rejoinder i own that be able regard you as future mistress kellynch future lady elliot look forward see you occupying your dear mother s place succeeding all her rights all her popularity as well as all her virtues would be highest possible gratification me you are your mother s self countenance disposition if i might be allowed fancy you such as she was situation name home presiding blessing same spot only superior her being more highly valued my dearest anne it would give me more delight than is often felt at my time life anne was obliged turn away rise walk distant table leaning there pretended employment try subdue feelings this picture excited for few moments her imagination her heart were bewitched idea becoming what her mother had been having precious name lady elliot first revived herself being restored kellynch calling it her home again her home for ever was charm which she could not immediately resist lady russell said not another word willing leave matter its own operation believing that could mr elliot at that moment with propriety have spoken for himself she believed short what anne did not believe same image mr elliot speaking for himself brought anne composure again charm kellynch lady elliot all faded away she never could accept him it was not only that her feelings were still adverse any man save one her judgement on serious consideration possibilities such case was against mr elliot though they had now been acquainted month she could not be satisfied that she really knew his character that he was sensible man agreeable man that he talked well professed good opinions seemed judge properly as man principle this was all clear enough he certainly knew what was right nor could she fix on any one article moral duty evidently transgressed but yet she would have been afraid answer for his conduct she distrusted past if not present names which occasionally dropt former associates allusions former practices pursuits suggested suspicions not favourable what he had been she saw that there had been bad habits that sunday travelling had been common thing that there had been period his life probably not short one when he had been at least careless all serious matters though he might now think very differently who could answer for true sentiments clever cautious man grown old enough appreciate fair character how could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed mr elliot was rational discreet polished but he was not open there was never any burst feeling any warmth indignation or delight at evil or good others this anne was decided imperfection her early impressions were incurable she prized frank open hearted eager character beyond all others warmth enthusiasm did captivate her still she felt that she could so much more depend upon sincerity those who sometimes looked or said careless or hasty thing than those whose presence mind never varied whose tongue never slipped mr elliot was too generally agreeable various as were tempers her father s house he pleased them all he endured too well stood too well with every body he had spoken her with some degree openness mrs clay had appeared completely see what mrs clay was about hold her contempt yet mrs clay found him as agreeable as any body lady russell saw either less or more than her young friend for she saw nothing excite distrust she could not imagine man more exactly what he ought be than mr elliot nor did she ever enjoy sweeter feeling than hope seeing him receive hand her beloved anne kellynch church course following autumn chapter xviii it was beginning february anne having been month bath was growing very eager for news from uppercross lyme she wanted hear much more than mary had communicated it was three weeks since she had heard at all she only knew that henrietta was at home again that louisa though considered be recovering fast was still lyme she was thinking them all very intently one evening when thicker letter than usual from mary was delivered her quicken pleasure surprise with admiral mrs croft s compliments crofts must be bath circumstance interest her they were people whom her heart turned very naturally what is this cried sir walter crofts have arrived bath crofts who rent kellynch what have they brought you letter from uppercross cottage sir oh those letters are convenient passports they secure introduction i should have visited admiral croft however at any rate i know what is due my tenant anne could listen no longer she could not even have told how poor admiral s complexion escaped her letter engrossed her it had been begun several days back february 1st my dear anne i make no apology for my silence because i know how little people think letters such place as bath you must be great deal too happy care for uppercross which as you well know affords little write about we have had very dull christmas mr mrs musgrove have not had one dinner party all holidays i do not reckon hayters as anybody holidays however are over at last i believe no children ever had such long ones i am sure i had not house was cleared yesterday except little harvilles but you will be surprised hear they have never gone home mrs harville must be odd mother part with them so long i do not understand it they are not at all nice children my opinion but mrs musgrove seems like them quite as well if not better than her grandchildren what dreadful weather we have had it may not be felt bath with your nice pavements but country it is some consequence i have not had creature call on me since second week january except charles hayter who had been calling much oftener than was welcome between ourselves i think it great pity henrietta did not remain at lyme as long as louisa it would have kept her little out his way carriage is gone day bring louisa harvilles morrow we are not asked dine with them however till day after mrs musgrove is so afraid her being fatigued by journey which is not very likely considering care that will be taken her it would be much more convenient me dine there morrow i am glad you find mr elliot so agreeable wish i could be acquainted with him too but i have my usual luck i am always out way when any thing desirable is going on always last my family be noticed what immense time mrs clay has been staying with elizabeth does she never mean go away but perhaps if she were leave room vacant we might not be invited let me know what you think this i do not expect my children be asked you know i can leave them at great house very well for month or six weeks i have this moment heard that crofts are going bath almost immediately they think admiral gouty charles heard it quite by chance they have not had civility give me any notice or offering take anything i do not think they improve at all as neighbours we see nothing them this is really instance gross inattention charles joins me love everything proper yours affectionately mary m i am sorry say that i am very far from well jemima has just told me that butcher says there is bad sore throat very much about i dare say i shall catch it my sore throats you know are always worse than anybody s so ended first part which had been afterwards put into envelope containing nearly as much more i kept my letter open that i might send you word how louisa bore her journey now i am extremely glad i did having great deal add first place i had note from mrs croft yesterday offering convey anything you very kind friendly note indeed addressed me just as it ought i shall therefore be able make my letter as long as i like admiral does not seem very ill i sincerely hope bath will do him all good he wants i shall be truly glad have them back again our neighbourhood cannot spare such pleasant family but now for louisa i have something communicate that will astonish you not little she harvilles came on tuesday very safely evening we went ask her how she did when we were rather surprised not find captain benwick party for he had been invited as well as harvilles what do you think was reason neither more nor less than his being love with louisa not choosing venture uppercross till he had had answer from mr musgrove for it was all settled between him her before she came away he had written her father by captain harville true upon my honour are not you astonished i shall be surprised at least if you ever received hint it for i never did mrs musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing matter we are all very well pleased however for though it is not equal her marrying captain wentworth it is infinitely better than charles hayter mr musgrove has written his consent captain benwick is expected day mrs harville says her husband feels good deal on his poor sister s account but however louisa is great favourite with both indeed mrs harville i quite agree that we love her better for having nursed her charles wonders what captain wentworth will say but if you remember i never thought him attached louisa i never could see anything it this is end you see captain benwick s being supposed be admirer yours how charles could take such thing into his head was always incomprehensible me i hope he will be more agreeable now certainly not great match for louisa musgrove but million times better than marrying among hayters mary need not have feared her sister s being any degree prepared for news she had never her life been more astonished captain benwick louisa musgrove it was almost too wonderful for belief it was with greatest effort that she could remain room preserve air calmness answer common questions moment happily for her they were not many sir walter wanted know whether crofts travelled with four horses whether they were likely be situated such part bath as it might suit miss elliot himself visit but had little curiosity beyond how is mary said elizabeth without waiting for answer pray what brings crofts bath they come on admiral s account he is thought be gouty gout decrepitude said sir walter poor old gentleman have they any acquaintance here asked elizabeth i do not know but i can hardly suppose that at admiral croft s time life his profession he should not have many acquaintance such place as this i suspect said sir walter coolly that admiral croft will be best known bath as renter kellynch hall elizabeth may we venture present him his wife laura place oh no i think not situated as we are with lady dalrymple cousins we ought be very careful not embarrass her with acquaintance she might not approve if we were not related it would not signify but as cousins she would feel scrupulous as any proposal ours we had better leave crofts find their own level there are several odd looking men walking about here who i am told are sailors crofts will associate with them this was sir walter elizabeth s share interest letter when mrs clay had paid her tribute more decent attention enquiry after mrs charles musgrove her fine little boys anne was at liberty her own room she tried comprehend it well might charles wonder how captain wentworth would feel perhaps he had quitted field had given louisa up had ceased love had found he did not love her she could not endure idea treachery or levity or anything akin ill usage between him his friend she could not endure that such friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly captain benwick louisa musgrove high spirited joyous talking louisa musgrove dejected thinking feeling reading captain benwick seemed each them everything that would not suit other their minds most dissimilar where could have been attraction answer soon presented itself it had been situation they had been thrown together several weeks they had been living same small family party since henrietta s coming away they must have been depending almost entirely on each other louisa just recovering from illness had been interesting state captain benwick was not inconsolable that was point which anne had not been able avoid suspecting before instead drawing same conclusion as mary from present course events they served only confirm idea his having felt some dawning tenderness toward herself she did not mean however derive much more from it gratify her vanity than mary might have allowed she was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing young woman who had listened seemed feel for him would have received same compliment he had affectionate heart he must love somebody she saw no reason against their being happy louisa had fine naval fervour begin with they would soon grow more alike he would gain cheerfulness she would learn be enthusiast for scott lord byron nay that was probably learnt already course they had fallen love over poetry idea louisa musgrove turned into person literary taste sentimental reflection was amusing but she had no doubt its being so day at lyme fall from cobb might influence her health her nerves her courage her character end her life as thoroughly as it appeared have influenced her fate conclusion whole was that if woman who had been sensible captain wentworth s merits could be allowed prefer another man there was nothing engagement excite lasting wonder if captain wentworth lost no friend by it certainly nothing be regretted no it was not regret which made anne s heart beat spite herself brought colour into her cheeks when she thought captain wentworth unshackled free she had some feelings which she was ashamed investigate they were too much like joy senseless joy she longed see crofts but when meeting took place it was evident that no rumour news had yet reached them visit ceremony was paid returned louisa musgrove was mentioned captain benwick too without even half smile crofts had placed themselves lodgings gay street perfectly sir walter s satisfaction he was not at all ashamed acquaintance did fact think talk great deal more about admiral than admiral ever thought or talked about him crofts knew quite as many people bath as they wished for considered their intercourse with elliots as mere matter form not least likely afford them any pleasure they brought with them their country habit being almost always together he was ordered walk keep off gout mrs croft seemed go shares with him everything walk for her life do him good anne saw them wherever she went lady russell took her out her carriage almost every morning she never failed think them never failed see them knowing their feelings as she did it was most attractive picture happiness her she always watched them as long as she could delighted fancy she understood what they might be talking as they walked along happy independence or equally delighted see admiral s hearty shake hand when he encountered old friend observe their eagerness conversation when occasionally forming into little knot navy mrs croft looking as intelligent keen as any officers around her anne was too much engaged with lady russell be often walking herself but it so happened that one morning about week or ten days after croft s arrival it suited her best leave her friend or her friend s carriage lower part town return alone camden place walking up milsom street she had good fortune meet with admiral he was standing by himself at printshop window with his hands behind him earnest contemplation some print she not only might have passed him unseen but was obliged touch as well as address him before she could catch his notice when he did perceive acknowledge her however it was done with all his usual frankness good humour ha is it you thank you thank you this is treating me like friend here i am you see staring at picture i can never get by this shop without stopping but what thing here is by way boat do look at it did you ever see like what queer fellows your fine painters must be think that anybody would venture their lives such shapeless old cockleshell as that yet here are two gentlemen stuck up it mightily at their ease looking about them at rocks mountains as if they were not be upset next moment which they certainly must be i wonder where that boat was built laughing heartily i would not venture over horsepond it well turning away now where are you bound can i go anywhere for you or with you can i be any use none i thank you unless you will give me pleasure your company little way our road lies together i am going home that i will with all my heart farther too yes yes we will have snug walk together i have something tell you as we go along there take my arm that s right i do not feel comfortable if i have not woman there lord what boat it is taking last look at picture as they began be motion did you say that you had something tell me sir yes i have presently but here comes friend captain brigden i shall only say how d ye do as we pass however i shall not stop how d ye do brigden stares see anybody with me but my wife she poor soul is tied by leg she has blister on one her heels as large as three shilling piece if you look across street you will see admiral brand coming down his brother shabby fellows both them i am glad they are not on this side way sophy cannot bear them they played me pitiful trick once got away with some my best men i will tell you whole story another time there comes old sir archibald drew his grandson look he sees us he kisses his hand you he takes you for my wife ah peace has come too soon for that younker poor old sir archibald how do you like bath miss elliot it suits us very well we are always meeting with some old friend or other streets full them every morning sure have plenty chat then we get away from them all shut ourselves our lodgings draw our chairs are as snug as if we were at kellynch ay or as we used be even at north yarmouth deal we do not like our lodgings here worse i can tell you for putting us mind those we first had at north yarmouth wind blows through one cupboards just same way when they were got little farther anne ventured press again for what he had communicate she hoped when clear milsom street have her curiosity gratified but she was still obliged wait for admiral had made up his mind not begin till they had gained greater space quiet belmont as she was not really mrs croft she must let him have his own way as soon as they were fairly ascending belmont he began well now you shall hear something that will surprise you but first all you must tell me name young lady i am going talk about that young lady you know that we have all been so concerned for miss musgrove that all this has been happening her christian name i always forget her christian name anne had been ashamed appear comprehend so soon as she really did but now she could safely suggest name louisa ay ay miss louisa musgrove that is name i wish young ladies had not such number fine christian names i should never be out if they were all sophys or something that sort well this miss louisa we all thought you know was marry frederick he was courting her week after week only wonder was what they could be waiting for till business at lyme came then indeed it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain was set right but even then there was something odd their way going on instead staying at lyme he went off plymouth then he went off see edward when we came back from minehead he was gone down edward s there he has been ever since we have seen nothing him since november even sophy could not understand it but now matter has taken strangest turn all for this young lady same miss musgrove instead being marry frederick is marry james benwick you know james benwick little i am little acquainted with captain benwick well she is marry him nay most likely they are married already for i do not know what they should wait for i thought captain benwick very pleasing young man said anne i understand that he bears excellent character oh yes yes there is not word be said against james benwick he is only commander it is true made last summer these are bad times for getting on but he has not another fault that i know excellent good hearted fellow i assure you very active zealous officer too which is more than you would think for perhaps for that soft sort manner does not do him justice indeed you are mistaken there sir i should never augur want spirit from captain benwick s manners i thought them particularly pleasing i will answer for it they would generally please well well ladies are best judges but james benwick is rather too piano for me though very likely it is all our partiality sophy i cannot help thinking frederick s manners better than his there is something about frederick more our taste anne was caught she had only meant oppose too common idea spirit gentleness being incompatible with each other not at all represent captain benwick s manners as very best that could possibly be after little hesitation she was beginning say i was not entering into any comparison two friends but admiral interrupted her with thing is certainly true it is not mere bit gossip we have it from frederick himself his sister had letter from him yesterday which he tells us it he had just had it letter from harville written upon spot from uppercross i fancy they are all at uppercross this was opportunity which anne could not resist she said therefore i hope admiral i hope there is nothing style captain wentworth s letter make you mrs croft particularly uneasy it did seem last autumn as if there were attachment between him louisa musgrove but i hope it may be understood have worn out on each side equally without violence i hope his letter does not breathe spirit ill used man not at all not at all there is not oath or murmur from beginning end anne looked down hide her smile no no frederick is not man whine complain he has too much spirit for that if girl likes another man better it is very fit she should have him certainly but what i mean is that i hope there is nothing captain wentworth s manner writing make you suppose he thinks himself ill used by his friend which might appear you know without its being absolutely said i should be very sorry that such friendship as has subsisted between him captain benwick should be destroyed or even wounded by circumstance this sort yes yes i understand you but there is nothing at all that nature letter he does not give least fling at benwick does not so much as say i wonder at it i have reason my own for wondering at it no you would not guess from his way writing that he had ever thought this miss what s her name for himself he very handsomely hopes they will be happy together there is nothing very unforgiving that i think anne did not receive perfect conviction which admiral meant convey but it would have been useless press enquiry farther she therefore satisfied herself with common place remarks or quiet attention admiral had it all his own way poor frederick said he at last now he must begin all over again with somebody else i think we must get him bath sophy must write beg him come bath here are pretty girls enough i am sure it would be no use go uppercross again for that other miss musgrove i find is bespoke by her cousin young parson do not you think miss elliot we had better try get him bath chapter xix while admiral croft was taking this walk with anne expressing his wish getting captain wentworth bath captain wentworth was already on his way thither before mrs croft had written he was arrived very next time anne walked out she saw him mr elliot was attending his two cousins mrs clay they were milsom street it began rain not much but enough make shelter desirable for women quite enough make it very desirable for miss elliot have advantage being conveyed home lady dalrymple s carriage which was seen waiting at little distance she anne mrs clay therefore turned into molland s while mr elliot stepped lady dalrymple request her assistance he soon joined them again successful course lady dalrymple would be most happy take them home would call for them few minutes her ladyship s carriage was barouche did not hold more than four with any comfort miss carteret was with her mother consequently it was not reasonable expect accommodation for all three camden place ladies there could be no doubt as miss elliot whoever suffered inconvenience she must suffer none but it occupied little time settle point civility between other two rain was mere trifle anne was most sincere preferring walk with mr elliot but rain was also mere trifle mrs clay she would hardly allow it even drop at all her boots were so thick much thicker than miss anne s short her civility rendered her quite as anxious be left walk with mr elliot as anne could be it was discussed between them with generosity so polite so determined that others were obliged settle it for them miss elliot maintaining that mrs clay had little cold already mr elliot deciding on appeal that his cousin anne s boots were rather thickest it was fixed accordingly that mrs clay should be party carriage they had just reached this point when anne as she sat near window descried most decidedly distinctly captain wentworth walking down street her start was perceptible only herself but she instantly felt that she was greatest simpleton world most unaccountable absurd for few minutes she saw nothing before her it was all confusion she was lost when she had scolded back her senses she found others still waiting for carriage mr elliot always obliging just setting off for union street on commission mrs clay s she now felt great inclination go outer door she wanted see if it rained why was she suspect herself another motive captain wentworth must be out sight she left her seat she would go one half her should not be always so much wiser than other half or always suspecting other being worse than it was she would see if it rained she was sent back however moment by entrance captain wentworth himself among party gentlemen ladies evidently his acquaintance whom he must have joined little below milsom street he was more obviously struck confused by sight her than she had ever observed before he looked quite red for first time since their renewed acquaintance she felt that she was betraying least sensibility two she had advantage him preparation last few moments all overpowering blinding bewildering first effects strong surprise were over with her still however she had enough feel it was agitation pain pleasure something between delight misery he spoke her then turned away character his manner was embarrassment she could not have called it either cold or friendly or anything so certainly as embarrassed after short interval however he came towards her spoke again mutual enquiries on common subjects passed neither them probably much wiser for what they heard anne continuing fully sensible his being less at ease than formerly they had by dint being so very much together got speak each other with considerable portion apparent indifference calmness but he could not do it now time had changed him or louisa had changed him there was consciousness some sort or other he looked very well not as if he had been suffering health or spirits he talked uppercross musgroves nay even louisa had even momentary look his own arch significance as he named her but yet it was captain wentworth not comfortable not easy not able feign that he was it did not surprise but it grieved anne observe that elizabeth would not know him she saw that he saw elizabeth that elizabeth saw him that there was complete internal recognition on each side she was convinced that he was ready be acknowledged as acquaintance expecting it she had pain seeing her sister turn away with unalterable coldness lady dalrymple s carriage for which miss elliot was growing very impatient now drew up servant came announce it it was beginning rain again altogether there was delay bustle talking which must make all little crowd shop understand that lady dalrymple was calling convey miss elliot at last miss elliot her friend unattended but by servant for there was no cousin returned were walking off captain wentworth watching them turned again anne by manner rather than words was offering his services her i am much obliged you was her answer but i am not going with them carriage would not accommodate so many i walk i prefer walking but it rains oh very little nothing that i regard after moment s pause he said though i came only yesterday i have equipped myself properly for bath already you see pointing new umbrella i wish you would make use it if you are determined walk though i think it would be more prudent let me get you chair she was very much obliged him but declined it all repeating her conviction that rain would come nothing at present adding i am only waiting for mr elliot he will be here moment i am sure she had hardly spoken words when mr elliot walked captain wentworth recollected him perfectly there was no difference between him man who had stood on steps at lyme admiring anne as she passed except air look manner privileged relation friend he came with eagerness appeared see think only her apologised for his stay was grieved have kept her waiting anxious get her away without further loss time before rain increased another moment they walked off together her arm under his gentle embarrassed glance good morning you being all that she had time for as she passed away as soon as they were out sight ladies captain wentworth s party began talking them mr elliot does not dislike his cousin i fancy oh no that is clear enough one can guess what will happen there he is always with them half lives family i believe what very good looking man yes miss atkinson who dined with him once at wallises says he is most agreeable man she ever was company with she is pretty i think anne elliot very pretty when one comes look at her it is not fashion say so but i confess i admire her more than her sister oh so do i so do i no comparison but men are all wild after miss elliot anne is too delicate for them anne would have been particularly obliged her cousin if he would have walked by her side all way camden place without saying word she had never found it so difficult listen him though nothing could exceed his solicitude care though his subjects were principally such as were wont be always interesting praise warm just discriminating lady russell insinuations highly rational against mrs clay but just now she could think only captain wentworth she could not understand his present feelings whether he were really suffering much from disappointment or not till that point were settled she could not be quite herself she hoped be wise reasonable time but alas alas she must confess herself that she was not wise yet another circumstance very essential for her know was how long he meant be bath he had not mentioned it or she could not recollect it he might be only passing through but it was more probable that he should be come stay that case so liable as every body was meet every body bath lady russell would all likelihood see him somewhere would she recollect him how would it all be she had already been obliged tell lady russell that louisa musgrove was marry captain benwick it had cost her something encounter lady russell s surprise now if she were by any chance be thrown into company with captain wentworth her imperfect knowledge matter might add another shade prejudice against him following morning anne was out with her friend for first hour incessant fearful sort watch for him vain but at last returning down pulteney street she distinguished him on right hand pavement at such distance as have him view greater part street there were many other men about him many groups walking same way but there was no mistaking him she looked instinctively at lady russell but not from any mad idea her recognising him so soon as she did herself no it was not be supposed that lady russell would perceive him till they were nearly opposite she looked at her however from time time anxiously when moment approached which must point him out though not daring look again for her own countenance she knew was unfit be seen she was yet perfectly conscious lady russell s eyes being turned exactly direction for him her being short intently observing him she could thoroughly comprehend sort fascination he must possess over lady russell s mind difficulty it must be for her withdraw her eyes astonishment she must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him foreign climes active service too without robbing him one personal grace at last lady russell drew back her head now how would she speak him you will wonder said she what has been fixing my eye so long but i was looking after some window curtains which lady alicia mrs frankland were telling me last night they described drawing room window curtains one houses on this side way this part street as being handsomest best hung any bath but could not recollect exact number i have been trying find out which it could be but i confess i can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description anne sighed blushed smiled pity disdain either at her friend or herself part which provoked her most was that all this waste foresight caution she should have lost right moment for seeing whether he saw them day or two passed without producing anything theatre or rooms where he was most likely be were not fashionable enough for elliots whose evening amusements were solely elegant stupidity private parties which they were getting more more engaged anne wearied such state stagnation sick knowing nothing fancying herself stronger because her strength was not tried was quite impatient for concert evening it was concert for benefit person patronised by lady dalrymple course they must attend it was really expected be good one captain wentworth was very fond music if she could only have few minutes conversation with him again she fancied she should be satisfied as power addressing him she felt all over courage if opportunity occurred elizabeth had turned from him lady russell overlooked him her nerves were strengthened by these circumstances she felt that she owed him attention she had once partly promised mrs smith spend evening with her but short hurried call she excused herself put it off with more decided promise longer visit on morrow mrs smith gave most good humoured acquiescence by all means said she only tell me all about it when you do come who is your party anne named them all mrs smith made no reply but when she was leaving her said with expression half serious half arch well i heartily wish your concert may answer do not fail me morrow if you can come for i begin have foreboding that i may not have many more visits from you anne was startled confused but after standing moment s suspense was obliged not sorry be obliged hurry away chapter xx sir walter his two daughters mrs clay were earliest all their party at rooms evening as lady dalrymple must be waited for they took their station by one fires octagon room but hardly were they so settled when door opened again captain wentworth walked alone anne was nearest him making yet little advance she instantly spoke he was preparing only bow pass on but her gentle how do you do brought him out straight line stand near her make enquiries return spite formidable father sister back ground their being back ground was support anne she knew nothing their looks felt equal everything which she believed right be done while they were speaking whispering between her father elizabeth caught her ear she could not distinguish but she must guess subject on captain wentworth s making distant bow she comprehended that her father had judged so well as give him that simple acknowledgement acquaintance she was just time by side glance see slight curtsey from elizabeth herself this though late reluctant ungracious was yet better than nothing her spirits improved after talking however weather bath concert their conversation began flag so little was said at last that she was expecting him go every moment but he did not he seemed no hurry leave her presently with renewed spirit with little smile little glow he said i have hardly seen you since our day at lyme i am afraid you must have suffered from shock more from its not overpowering you at time she assured him that she had not it was frightful hour said he frightful day he passed his hand across his eyes as if remembrance were still too painful but moment half smiling again added day has produced some effects however has had some consequences which must be considered as very reverse frightful when you had presence mind suggest that benwick would be properest person fetch surgeon you could have little idea his being eventually one those most concerned her recovery certainly i could have none but it appears i should hope it would be very happy match there are on both sides good principles good temper yes said he looking not exactly forward but there i think ends resemblance with all my soul i wish them happy rejoice over every circumstance favour it they have no difficulties contend with at home no opposition no caprice no delays musgroves are behaving like themselves most honourably kindly only anxious with true parental hearts promote their daughter s comfort all this is much very much favour their happiness more than perhaps he stopped sudden recollection seemed occur give him some taste that emotion which was reddening anne s cheeks fixing her eyes on ground after clearing his throat however he proceeded thus i confess that i do think there is disparity too great disparity point no less essential than mind i regard louisa musgrove as very amiable sweet tempered girl not deficient understanding but benwick is something more he is clever man reading man i confess that i do consider his attaching himself her with some surprise had it been effect gratitude had he learnt love her because he believed her be preferring him it would have been another thing but i have no reason suppose it so it seems on contrary have been perfectly spontaneous untaught feeling on his side this surprises me man like him his situation with heart pierced wounded almost broken fanny harville was very superior creature his attachment her was indeed attachment man does not recover from such devotion heart such woman he ought not he does not either from consciousness however that his friend had recovered or from other consciousness he went no farther anne who spite agitated voice which latter part had been uttered spite all various noises room almost ceaseless slam door ceaseless buzz persons walking through had distinguished every word was struck gratified confused beginning breathe very quick feel hundred things moment it was impossible for her enter on such subject yet after pause feeling necessity speaking having not smallest wish for total change she only deviated so far as say you were good while at lyme i think about fortnight i could not leave it till louisa s doing well was quite ascertained i had been too deeply concerned mischief be soon at peace it had been my doing solely mine she would not have been obstinate if i had not been weak country round lyme is very fine i walked rode great deal more i saw more i found admire i should very much like see lyme again said anne indeed i should not have supposed that you could have found anything lyme inspire such feeling horror distress you were involved stretch mind wear spirits i should have thought your last impressions lyme must have been strong disgust last hours were certainly very painful replied anne but when pain is over remembrance it often becomes pleasure one does not love place less for having suffered it unless it has been all suffering nothing but suffering which was by no means case at lyme we were only anxiety distress during last two hours previously there had been great deal enjoyment so much novelty beauty i have travelled so little that every fresh place would be interesting me but there is real beauty at lyme short with faint blush at some recollections altogether my impressions place are very agreeable as she ceased entrance door opened again very party appeared for whom they were waiting lady dalrymple lady dalrymple was rejoicing sound with all eagerness compatible with anxious elegance sir walter his two ladies stepped forward meet her lady dalrymple miss carteret escorted by mr elliot colonel wallis who had happened arrive nearly at same instant advanced into room others joined them it was group which anne found herself also necessarily included she was divided from captain wentworth their interesting almost too interesting conversation must be broken up for time but slight was penance compared with happiness which brought it on she had learnt last ten minutes more his feelings towards louisa more all his feelings than she dared think she gave herself up demands party needful civilities moment with exquisite though agitated sensations she was good humour with all she had received ideas which disposed her be courteous kind all pity every one as being less happy than herself delightful emotions were little subdued when on stepping back from group be joined again by captain wentworth she saw that he was gone she was just time see him turn into concert room he was gone he had disappeared she felt moment s regret but they should meet again he would look for her he would find her out before evening were over at present perhaps it was as well be asunder she was need little interval for recollection upon lady russell s appearance soon afterwards whole party was collected all that remained was marshal themselves proceed into concert room be all consequence their power draw as many eyes excite as many whispers disturb as many people as they could very very happy were both elizabeth anne elliot as they walked elizabeth arm arm with miss carteret looking on broad back dowager viscountess dalrymple before her had nothing wish for which did not seem within her reach anne but it would be insult nature anne s felicity draw any comparison between it her sister s origin one all selfish vanity other all generous attachment anne saw nothing thought nothing brilliancy room her happiness was from within her eyes were bright her cheeks glowed but she knew nothing about it she was thinking only last half hour as they passed their seats her mind took hasty range over it his choice subjects his expressions still more his manner look had been such as she could see only one light his opinion louisa musgrove s inferiority opinion which he had seemed solicitous give his wonder at captain benwick his feelings as first strong attachment sentences begun which he could not finish his half averted eyes more than half expressive glance all all declared that he had heart returning her at least that anger resentment avoidance were no more that they were succeeded not merely by friendship regard but by tenderness past yes some share tenderness past she could not contemplate change as implying less he must love her these were thoughts with their attendant visions which occupied flurried her too much leave her any power observation she passed along room without having glimpse him without even trying discern him when their places were determined on they were all properly arranged she looked round see if he should happen be same part room but he was not her eye could not reach him concert being just opening she must consent for time be happy humbler way party was divided disposed on two contiguous benches anne was among those on foremost mr elliot had man uvred so well with assistance his friend colonel wallis as have seat by her miss elliot surrounded by her cousins principal object colonel wallis s gallantry was quite contented anne s mind was most favourable state for entertainment evening it was just occupation enough she had feelings for tender spirits for gay attention for scientific patience for wearisome had never liked concert better at least during first act towards close it interval succeeding italian song she explained words song mr elliot they had concert bill between them this said she is nearly sense or rather meaning words for certainly sense italian love song must not be talked but it is as nearly meaning as i can give for i do not pretend understand language i am very poor italian scholar yes yes i see you are i see you know nothing matter you have only knowledge enough language translate at sight these inverted transposed curtailed italian lines into clear comprehensible elegant english you need not say anything more your ignorance here is complete proof i will not oppose such kind politeness but i should be sorry be examined by real proficient i have not had pleasure visiting camden place so long replied he without knowing something miss anne elliot i do regard her as one who is too modest for world general be aware half her accomplishments too highly accomplished for modesty be natural any other woman for shame for shame this is too much flattery i forget what we are have next turning bill perhaps said mr elliot speaking low i have had longer acquaintance with your character than you are aware indeed how so you can have been acquainted with it only since i came bath excepting as you might hear me previously spoken my own family i knew you by report long before you came bath i had heard you described by those who knew you intimately i have been acquainted with you by character many years your person your disposition accomplishments manner they were all present me mr elliot was not disappointed interest he hoped raise no one can withstand charm such mystery have been described long ago recent acquaintance by nameless people is irresistible anne was all curiosity she wondered questioned him eagerly but vain he delighted being asked but he would not tell no no some time or other perhaps but not now he would mention no names now but such he could assure her had been fact he had many years ago received such description miss anne elliot as had inspired him with highest idea her merit excited warmest curiosity know her anne could think no one so likely have spoken with partiality her many years ago as mr wentworth monkford captain wentworth s brother he might have been mr elliot s company but she had not courage ask question name anne elliot said he has long had interesting sound me very long has it possessed charm over my fancy if i dared i would breathe my wishes that name might never change such she believed were his words but scarcely had she received their sound than her attention was caught by other sounds immediately behind her which rendered every thing else trivial her father lady dalrymple were speaking well looking man said sir walter very well looking man very fine young man indeed said lady dalrymple more air than one often sees bath irish i dare say no i just know his name bowing acquaintance wentworth captain wentworth navy his sister married my tenant somersetshire croft who rents kellynch before sir walter had reached this point anne s eyes had caught right direction distinguished captain wentworth standing among cluster men at little distance as her eyes fell on him his seemed be withdrawn from her it had that appearance it seemed as if she had been one moment too late as long as she dared observe he did not look again but performance was recommencing she was forced seem restore her attention orchestra look straight forward when she could give another glance he had moved away he could not have come nearer her if he would she was so surrounded shut but she would rather have caught his eye mr elliot s speech too distressed her she had no longer any inclination talk him she wished him not so near her first act was over now she hoped for some beneficial change after period nothing saying amongst party some them did decide on going quest tea anne was one few who did not choose move she remained her seat so did lady russell but she had pleasure getting rid mr elliot she did not mean whatever she might feel on lady russell s account shrink from conversation with captain wentworth if he gave her opportunity she was persuaded by lady russell s countenance that she had seen him he did not come however anne sometimes fancied she discerned him at distance but he never came anxious interval wore away unproductively others returned room filled again benches were reclaimed repossessed another hour pleasure or penance was be sat out another hour music was give delight or gapes as real or affected taste for it prevailed anne it chiefly wore prospect hour agitation she could not quit that room peace without seeing captain wentworth once more without interchange one friendly look re settling themselves there were now many changes result which was favourable for her colonel wallis declined sitting down again mr elliot was invited by elizabeth miss carteret manner not be refused sit between them by some other removals little scheming her own anne was enabled place herself much nearer end bench than she had been before much more within reach passer by she could not do so without comparing herself with miss larolles inimitable miss larolles but still she did it not with much happier effect though by what seemed prosperity shape early abdication her next neighbours she found herself at very end bench before concert closed such was her situation with vacant space at hand when captain wentworth was again sight she saw him not far off he saw her too yet he looked grave seemed irresolute only by very slow degrees came at last near enough speak her she felt that something must be matter change was indubitable difference between his present air what it had been octagon room was strikingly great why was it she thought her father lady russell could there have been any unpleasant glances he began by speaking concert gravely more like captain wentworth uppercross owned himself disappointed had expected singing short must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over anne replied spoke defence performance so well yet allowance for his feelings so pleasantly that his countenance improved he replied again with almost smile they talked for few minutes more improvement held he even looked down towards bench as if he saw place on it well worth occupying when at that moment touch on her shoulder obliged anne turn round it came from mr elliot he begged her pardon but she must be applied explain italian again miss carteret was very anxious have general idea what was next be sung anne could not refuse but never had she sacrificed politeness with more suffering spirit few minutes though as few as possible were inevitably consumed when her own mistress again when able turn look as she had done before she found herself accosted by captain wentworth reserved yet hurried sort farewell he must wish her good night he was going he should get home as fast as he could is not this song worth staying for said anne suddenly struck by idea which made her yet more anxious be encouraging no he replied impressively there is nothing worth my staying for he was gone directly jealousy mr elliot it was only intelligible motive captain wentworth jealous her affection could she have believed it week ago three hours ago for moment gratification was exquisite but alas there were very different thoughts succeed how was such jealousy be quieted how was truth reach him how all peculiar disadvantages their respective situations would he ever learn her real sentiments it was misery think mr elliot s attentions their evil was incalculable chapter xxi anne recollected with pleasure next morning her promise going mrs smith meaning that it should engage her from home at time when mr elliot would be most likely call for avoid mr elliot was almost first object she felt great deal good will towards him spite mischief his attentions she owed him gratitude regard perhaps compassion she could not help thinking much extraordinary circumstances attending their acquaintance right which he seemed have interest her by everything situation by his own sentiments by his early prepossession it was altogether very extraordinary flattering but painful there was much regret how she might have felt had there been no captain wentworth case was not worth enquiry for there was captain wentworth be conclusion present suspense good or bad her affection would be his for ever their union she believed could not divide her more from other men than their final separation prettier musings high wrought love eternal constancy could never have passed along streets bath than anne was sporting with from camden place westgate buildings it was almost enough spread purification perfume all way she was sure pleasant reception her friend seemed this morning particularly obliged her for coming seemed hardly have expected her though it had been appointment account concert was immediately claimed anne s recollections concert were quite happy enough animate her features make her rejoice talk it all that she could tell she told most gladly but all was little for one who had been there unsatisfactory for such enquirer as mrs smith who had already heard through short cut laundress waiter rather more general success produce evening than anne could relate who now asked vain for several particulars company everybody any consequence or notoriety bath was well know by name mrs smith little durands were there i conclude said she with their mouths open catch music like unfledged sparrows ready be fed they never miss concert yes i did not see them myself but i heard mr elliot say they were room ibbotsons were they there two new beauties with tall irish officer who is talked for one them i do not know i do not think they were old lady mary maclean i need not ask after her she never misses i know you must have seen her she must have been your own circle for as you went with lady dalrymple you were seats grandeur round orchestra course no that was what i dreaded it would have been very unpleasant me every respect but happily lady dalrymple always chooses be farther off we were exceedingly well placed that is for hearing i must not say for seeing because i appear have seen very little oh you saw enough for your own amusement i can understand there is sort domestic enjoyment be known even crowd this you had you were large party yourselves you wanted nothing beyond but i ought have looked about me more said anne conscious while she spoke that there had fact been no want looking about that object only had been deficient no no you were better employed you need not tell me that you had pleasant evening i see it your eye i perfectly see how hours passed that you had always something agreeable listen intervals concert it was conversation anne half smiled said do you see that my eye yes i do your countenance perfectly informs me that you were company last night with person whom you think most agreeable world person who interests you at this present time more than all rest world put together blush overspread anne s cheeks she could say nothing such being case continued mrs smith after short pause i hope you believe that i do know how value your kindness coming me this morning it is really very good you come sit with me when you must have so many pleasanter demands upon your time anne heard nothing this she was still astonishment confusion excited by her friend s penetration unable imagine how any report captain wentworth could have reached her after another short silence pray said mrs smith is mr elliot aware your acquaintance with me does he know that i am bath mr elliot repeated anne looking up surprised moment s reflection shewed her mistake she had been under she caught it instantaneously recovering her courage with feeling safety soon added more composedly are you acquainted with mr elliot i have been good deal acquainted with him replied mrs smith gravely but it seems worn out now it is great while since we met i was not at all aware this you never mentioned it before had i known it i would have had pleasure talking him about you confess truth said mrs smith assuming her usual air cheerfulness that is exactly pleasure i want you have i want you talk about me mr elliot i want your interest with him he can be essential service me if you would have goodness my dear miss elliot make it object yourself course it is done i should be extremely happy i hope you cannot doubt my willingness be even slightest use you replied anne but i suspect that you are considering me as having higher claim on mr elliot greater right influence him than is really case i am sure you have somehow or other imbibed such notion you must consider me only as mr elliot s relation if that light there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask him i beg you would not hesitate employ me mrs smith gave her penetrating glance then smiling said i have been little premature i perceive i beg your pardon i ought have waited for official information but now my dear miss elliot as old friend do give me hint as when i may speak next week be sure by next week i may be allowed think it all settled build my own selfish schemes on mr elliot s good fortune no replied anne nor next week nor next nor next i assure you that nothing sort you are thinking will be settled any week i am not going marry mr elliot i should like know why you imagine i am mrs smith looked at her again looked earnestly smiled shook her head exclaimed now how i do wish i understood you how i do wish i knew what you were at i have great idea that you do not design be cruel when right moment occurs till it does come you know we women never mean have anybody it is thing course among us that every man is refused till he offers but why should you be cruel let me plead for my present friend i cannot call him but for my former friend where can you look for more suitable match where could you expect more gentlemanlike agreeable man let me recommend mr elliot i am sure you hear nothing but good him from colonel wallis who can know him better than colonel wallis my dear mrs smith mr elliot s wife has not been dead much above half year he ought not be supposed be paying his addresses any one oh if these are your only objections cried mrs smith archly mr elliot is safe i shall give myself no more trouble about him do not forget me when you are married that s all let him know me be friend yours then he will think little trouble required which it is very natural for him now with so many affairs engagements his own avoid get rid as he can very natural perhaps ninety nine out hundred would do same course he cannot be aware importance me well my dear miss elliot i hope trust you will be very happy mr elliot has sense understand value such woman your peace will not be shipwrecked as mine has been you are safe all worldly matters safe his character he will not be led astray he will not be misled by others his ruin no said anne i can readily believe all that my cousin he seems have calm decided temper not at all open dangerous impressions i consider him with great respect i have no reason from any thing that has fallen within my observation do otherwise but i have not known him long he is not man i think be known intimately soon will not this manner speaking him mrs smith convince you that he is nothing me surely this must be calm enough upon my word he is nothing me should he ever propose me which i have very little reason imagine he has any thought doing i shall not accept him i assure you i shall not i assure you mr elliot had not share which you have been supposing whatever pleasure concert last night might afford not mr elliot it is not mr elliot that she stopped regretting with deep blush that she had implied so much but less would hardly have been sufficient mrs smith would hardly have believed so soon mr elliot s failure but from perception there being somebody else as it was she instantly submitted with all semblance seeing nothing beyond anne eager escape farther notice was impatient know why mrs smith should have fancied she was marry mr elliot where she could have received idea or from whom she could have heard it do tell me how it first came into your head it first came into my head replied mrs smith upon finding how much you were together feeling it be most probable thing world be wished for by everybody belonging either you you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed you same way but i never heard it spoken till two days ago has it indeed been spoken did you observe woman who opened door you when you called yesterday no was not it mrs speed as usual or maid i observed no one particular it was my friend mrs rooke nurse rooke who by bye had great curiosity see you was delighted be way let you she came away from marlborough buildings only on sunday she it was who told me you were marry mr elliot she had had it from mrs wallis herself which did not seem bad authority she sat hour with me on monday evening gave me whole history whole history repeated anne laughing she could not make very long history i think one such little article unfounded news mrs smith said nothing but continued anne presently though there is no truth my having this claim on mr elliot i should be extremely happy be use you any way that i could shall i mention him your being bath shall i take any message no i thank you no certainly not warmth moment under mistaken impression i might perhaps have endeavoured interest you some circumstances but not now no i thank you i have nothing trouble you with i think you spoke having known mr elliot many years i did not before he was married i suppose yes he was not married when i knew him first were you much acquainted intimately indeed then do tell me what he was at that time life i have great curiosity know what mr elliot was as very young man was he at all such as he appears now i have not seen mr elliot these three years was mrs smith s answer given so gravely that it was impossible pursue subject farther anne felt that she had gained nothing but increase curiosity they were both silent mrs smith very thoughtful at last i beg your pardon my dear miss elliot she cried her natural tone cordiality i beg your pardon for short answers i have been giving you but i have been uncertain what i ought do i have been doubting considering as what i ought tell you there were many things be taken into account one hates be officious be giving bad impressions making mischief even smooth surface family union seems worth preserving though there may be nothing durable beneath however i have determined i think i am right i think you ought be made acquainted with mr elliot s real character though i fully believe that at present you have not smallest intention accepting him there is no saying what may happen you might some time or other be differently affected towards him hear truth therefore now while you are unprejudiced mr elliot is man without heart or conscience designing wary cold blooded being who thinks only himself whom for his own interest or ease would be guilty any cruelty or any treachery that could be perpetrated without risk his general character he has no feeling for others those whom he has been chief cause leading into ruin he can neglect desert without smallest compunction he is totally beyond reach any sentiment justice or compassion oh he is black at heart hollow black anne s astonished air exclamation wonder made her pause calmer manner she added my expressions startle you you must allow for injured angry woman but i will try command myself i will not abuse him i will only tell you what i have found him facts shall speak he was intimate friend my dear husband who trusted loved him thought him as good as himself intimacy had been formed before our marriage i found them most intimate friends i too became excessively pleased with mr elliot entertained highest opinion him at nineteen you know one does not think very seriously but mr elliot appeared me quite as good as others much more agreeable than most others we were almost always together we were principally town living very good style he was then inferior circumstances he was then poor one he had chambers temple it was as much as he could do support appearance gentleman he had always home with us whenever he chose it he was always welcome he was like brother my poor charles who had finest most generous spirit world would have divided his last farthing with him i know that his purse was open him i know that he often assisted him this must have been about that very period mr elliot s life said anne which has always excited my particular curiosity it must have been about same time that he became known my father sister i never knew him myself i only heard him but there was something his conduct then with regard my father sister afterwards circumstances his marriage which i never could quite reconcile with present times it seemed announce different sort man i know it all i know it all cried mrs smith he had been introduced sir walter your sister before i was acquainted with him but i heard him speak them for ever i know he was invited encouraged i know he did not choose go i can satisfy you perhaps on points which you would little expect as his marriage i knew all about it at time i was privy all fors againsts i was friend whom he confided his hopes plans though i did not know his wife previously her inferior situation society indeed rendered that impossible yet i knew her all her life afterwards or at least till within last two years her life can answer any question you may wish put nay said anne i have no particular enquiry make about her i have always understood they were not happy couple but i should like know why at that time his life he should slight my father s acquaintance as he did my father was certainly disposed take very kind proper notice him why did mr elliot draw back mr elliot replied mrs smith at that period his life had one object view make his fortune by rather quicker process than law he was determined make it by marriage he was determined at least not mar it by imprudent marriage i know it was his belief whether justly or not course i cannot decide that your father sister their civilities invitations were designing match between heir young lady it was impossible that such match should have answered his ideas wealth independence that was his motive for drawing back i can assure you he told me whole story he had no concealments with me it was curious that having just left you behind me bath my first principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin that through him i should be continually hearing your father sister he described one miss elliot i thought very affectionately other perhaps cried anne struck by sudden idea you sometimes spoke me mr elliot be sure i did very often i used boast my own anne elliot vouch for your being very different creature from she checked herself just time this accounts for something which mr elliot said last night cried anne this explains it i found he had been used hear me i could not comprehend how what wild imaginations one forms where dear self is concerned how sure be mistaken but i beg your pardon i have interrupted you mr elliot married then completely for money circumstances probably which first opened your eyes his character mrs smith hesitated little here oh those things are too common when one lives world man or woman s marrying for money is too common strike one as it ought i was very young associated only with young we were thoughtless gay set without any strict rules conduct we lived for enjoyment i think differently now time sickness sorrow have given me other notions but at that period i must own i saw nothing reprehensible what mr elliot was doing do best for himself passed as duty but was not she very low woman yes which i objected but he would not regard money money was all that he wanted her father was grazier her grandfather had been butcher but that was all nothing she was fine woman had had decent education was brought forward by some cousins thrown by chance into mr elliot s company fell love with him not difficulty or scruple was there on his side with respect her birth all his caution was spent being secured real amount her fortune before he committed himself depend upon it whatever esteem mr elliot may have for his own situation life now as young man he had not smallest value for it his chance for kellynch estate was something but all honour family he held as cheap as dirt i have often heard him declare that if baronetcies were saleable anybody should have his for fifty pounds arms motto name livery included but i will not pretend repeat half that i used hear him say on that subject it would not be fair yet you ought have proof for what is all this but assertion you shall have proof indeed my dear mrs smith i want none cried anne you have asserted nothing contradictory what mr elliot appeared be some years ago this is all confirmation rather what we used hear believe i am more curious know why he should be so different now but for my satisfaction if you will have goodness ring for mary stay i am sure you will have still greater goodness going yourself into my bedroom bringing me small inlaid box which you will find on upper shelf closet anne seeing her friend be earnestly bent on it did as she was desired box was brought placed before her mrs smith sighing over it as she unlocked it said this is full papers belonging him my husband small portion only what i had look over when i lost him letter i am looking for was one written by mr elliot him before our marriage happened be saved why one can hardly imagine but he was careless immethodical like other men about those things when i came examine his papers i found it with others still more trivial from different people scattered here there while many letters memorandums real importance had been destroyed here it is i would not burn it because being even then very little satisfied with mr elliot i was determined preserve every document former intimacy i have now another motive for being glad that i can produce it this was letter directed charles smith esq tunbridge wells dated from london as far back as july 1803 dear smith i have received yours your kindness almost overpowers me i wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common but i have lived three twenty years world have seen none like it at present believe me i have no need your services being cash again give me joy i have got rid sir walter miss they are gone back kellynch almost made me swear visit them this summer but my first visit kellynch will be with surveyor tell me how bring it with best advantage hammer baronet nevertheless is not unlikely marry again he is quite fool enough if he does however they will leave me peace which may be decent equivalent for reversion he is worse than last year i wish i had any name but elliot i am sick it name walter i can drop thank god i desire you will never insult me with my second w again meaning for rest my life be only yours truly wm elliot such letter could not be read without putting anne glow mrs smith observing high colour her face said language i know is highly disrespectful though i have forgot exact terms i have perfect impression general meaning but it shows you man mark his professions my poor husband can any thing be stronger anne could not immediately get over shock mortification finding such words applied her father she was obliged recollect that her seeing letter was violation laws honour that no one ought be judged or be known by such testimonies that no private correspondence could bear eye others before she could recover calmness enough return letter which she had been meditating over say thank you this is full proof undoubtedly proof every thing you were saying but why be acquainted with us now i can explain this too cried mrs smith smiling can you really yes i have shewn you mr elliot as he was dozen years ago i will shew him as he is now i cannot produce written proof again but i can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire what he is now wanting what he is now doing he is no hypocrite now he truly wants marry you his present attentions your family are very sincere quite from heart i will give you my authority his friend colonel wallis colonel wallis you are acquainted with him no it does not come me quite so direct line as that it takes bend or two but nothing consequence stream is as good as at first little rubbish it collects turnings is easily moved away mr elliot talks unreservedly colonel wallis his views on you which said colonel wallis i imagine be himself sensible careful discerning sort character but colonel wallis has very pretty silly wife whom he tells things which he had better not he repeats it all her she overflowing spirits her recovery repeats it all her nurse nurse knowing my acquaintance with you very naturally brings it all me on monday evening my good friend mrs rooke let me thus much into secrets marlborough buildings when i talked whole history therefore you see i was not romancing so much as you supposed my dear mrs smith your authority is deficient this will not do mr elliot s having any views on me will not least account for efforts he made towards reconciliation with my father that was all prior my coming bath i found them on most friendly terms when i arrived i know you did i know it all perfectly but indeed mrs smith we must not expect get real information such line facts or opinions which are pass through hands so many be misconceived by folly one ignorance another can hardly have much truth left only give me hearing you will soon be able judge general credit due by listening some particulars which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm nobody supposes that you were his first inducement he had seen you indeed before he came bath admired you but without knowing it be you so says my historian at least is this true did he see you last summer or autumn somewhere down west use her own words without knowing it be you he certainly did so far it is very true at lyme i happened be at lyme well continued mrs smith triumphantly grant my friend credit due establishment first point asserted he saw you then at lyme liked you so well as be exceedingly pleased meet with you again camden place as miss anne elliot from that moment i have no doubt had double motive his visits there but there was another earlier which i will now explain if there is anything my story which you know be either false or improbable stop me my account states that your sister s friend lady now staying with you whom i have heard you mention came bath with miss elliot sir walter as long ago as september short when they first came themselves has been staying there ever since that she is clever insinuating handsome woman poor plausible altogether such situation manner as give general idea among sir walter s acquaintance her meaning be lady elliot as general surprise that miss elliot should be apparently blind danger here mrs smith paused moment but anne had not word say she continued this was light which it appeared those who knew family long before you returned it colonel wallis had his eye upon your father enough be sensible it though he did not then visit camden place but his regard for mr elliot gave him interest watching all that was going on there when mr elliot came bath for day or two as he happened do little before christmas colonel wallis made him acquainted with appearance things reports beginning prevail now you are understand that time had worked very material change mr elliot s opinions as value baronetcy upon all points blood connexion he is completely altered man having long had as much money as he could spend nothing wish for on side avarice or indulgence he has been gradually learning pin his happiness upon consequence he is heir i thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased but it is now confirmed feeling he cannot bear idea not being sir william you may guess therefore that news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable you may guess what it produced resolution coming back bath as soon as possible fixing himself here for time with view renewing his former acquaintance recovering such footing family as might give him means ascertaining degree his danger circumventing lady if he found it material this was agreed upon between two friends as only thing be done colonel wallis was assist every way that he could he was be introduced mrs wallis was be introduced everybody was be introduced mr elliot came back accordingly on application was forgiven as you know re admitted into family there it was his constant object his only object till your arrival added another motive watch sir walter mrs clay he omitted no opportunity being with them threw himself their way called at all hours but i need not be particular on this subject you can imagine what artful man would do with this guide perhaps may recollect what you have seen him do yes said anne you tell me nothing which does not accord with what i have known or could imagine there is always something offensive details cunning man uvres selfishness duplicity must ever be revolting but i have heard nothing which really surprises me i know those who would be shocked by such representation mr elliot who would have difficulty believing it but i have never been satisfied i have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared i should like know his present opinion as probability event he has been dread whether he considers danger be lessening or not lessening i understand replied mrs smith he thinks mrs clay afraid him aware that he sees through her not daring proceed as she might do his absence but since he must be absent some time or other i do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence mrs wallis has amusing idea as nurse tells me that it is be put into marriage articles when you mr elliot marry that your father is not marry mrs clay scheme worthy mrs wallis s understanding by all accounts but my sensible nurse rooke sees absurdity it why be sure ma am said she it would not prevent his marrying anybody else indeed own truth i do not think nurse her heart is very strenuous opposer sir walter s making second match she must be allowed be favourer matrimony you know since self will intrude who can say that she may not have some flying visions attending next lady elliot through mrs wallis s recommendation i am very glad know all this said anne after little thoughtfulness it will be more painful me some respects be company with him but i shall know better what do my line conduct will be more direct mr elliot is evidently disingenuous artificial worldly man who has never had any better principle guide him than selfishness but mr elliot was not done with mrs smith had been carried away from her first direction anne had forgotten interest her own family concerns how much had been originally implied against him but her attention was now called explanation those first hints she listened recital which if it did not perfectly justify unqualified bitterness mrs smith proved him have been very unfeeling his conduct towards her very deficient both justice compassion she learned that intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by mr elliot s marriage they had been as before always together mr elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune mrs smith did not want take blame herself was most tender throwing any on her husband but anne could collect that their income had never been equal their style living that from first there had been great deal general joint extravagance from his wife s account him she could discern mr smith have been man warm feelings easy temper careless habits not strong understanding much more amiable than his friend very unlike him led by him probably despised by him mr elliot raised by his marriage great affluence disposed every gratification pleasure vanity which could be commanded without involving himself for with all his self indulgence he had become prudent man beginning be rich just as his friend ought have found himself be poor seemed have had no concern at all for that friend s probable finances but on contrary had been prompting encouraging expenses which could end only ruin smiths accordingly had been ruined husband had died just time be spared full knowledge it they had previously known embarrassments enough try friendship their friends prove that mr elliot s had better not be tried but it was not till his death that wretched state his affairs was fully known with confidence mr elliot s regard more creditable his feelings than his judgement mr smith had appointed him executor his will but mr elliot would not act difficulties distress which this refusal had heaped on her addition inevitable sufferings her situation had been such as could not be related without anguish spirit or listened without corresponding indignation anne was shewn some letters his on occasion answers urgent applications from mrs smith which all breathed same stern resolution not engaging fruitless trouble under cold civility same hard hearted indifference any evils it might bring on her it was dreadful picture ingratitude inhumanity anne felt at some moments that no flagrant open crime could have been worse she had great deal listen all particulars past sad scenes all minutiae distress upon distress which former conversations had been merely hinted at were dwelt on now with natural indulgence anne could perfectly comprehend exquisite relief was only more inclined wonder at composure her friend s usual state mind there was one circumstance history her grievances particular irritation she had good reason believe that some property her husband west indies which had been for many years under sort sequestration for payment its own incumbrances might be recoverable by proper measures this property though not large would be enough make her comparatively rich but there was nobody stir it mr elliot would do nothing she could do nothing herself equally disabled from personal exertion by her state bodily weakness from employing others by her want money she had no natural connexions assist her even with their counsel she could not afford purchase assistance law this was cruel aggravation actually straitened means feel that she ought be better circumstances that little trouble right place might do it fear that delay might be even weakening her claims was hard bear it was on this point that she had hoped engage anne s good offices with mr elliot she had previously anticipation their marriage been very apprehensive losing her friend by it but on being assured that he could have made no attempt that nature since he did not even know her be bath it immediately occurred that something might be done her favour by influence woman he loved she had been hastily preparing interest anne s feelings as far as observances due mr elliot s character would allow when anne s refutation supposed engagement changed face everything while it took from her new formed hope succeeding object her first anxiety left her at least comfort telling whole story her own way after listening this full description mr elliot anne could not but express some surprise at mrs smith s having spoken him so favourably beginning their conversation she had seemed recommend praise him my dear was mrs smith s reply there was nothing else be done i considered your marrying him as certain though he might not yet have made offer i could no more speak truth him than if he had been your husband my heart bled for you as i talked happiness yet he is sensible he is agreeable with such woman as you it was not absolutely hopeless he was very unkind his first wife they were wretched together but she was too ignorant giddy for respect he had never loved her i was willing hope that you must fare better anne could just acknowledge within herself such possibility having been induced marry him as made her shudder at idea misery which must have followed it was just possible that she might have been persuaded by lady russell under such supposition which would have been most miserable when time had disclosed all too late it was very desirable that lady russell should be no longer deceived one concluding arrangements this important conference which carried them through greater part morning was that anne had full liberty communicate her friend everything relative mrs smith which his conduct was involved chapter xxii anne went home think over all that she had heard one point her feelings were relieved by this knowledge mr elliot there was no longer anything tenderness due him he stood as opposed captain wentworth all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness evil his attentions last night irremediable mischief he might have done was considered with sensations unqualified unperplexed pity for him was all over but this was only point relief every other respect looking around her or penetrating forward she saw more distrust apprehend she was concerned for disappointment pain lady russell would be feeling for mortifications which must be hanging over her father sister had all distress foreseeing many evils without knowing how avert any one them she was most thankful for her own knowledge him she had never considered herself as entitled reward for not slighting old friend like mrs smith but here was reward indeed springing from it mrs smith had been able tell her what no one else could have done could knowledge have been extended through her family but this was vain idea she must talk lady russell tell her consult with her having done her best wait event with as much composure as possible after all her greatest want composure would be that quarter mind which could not be opened lady russell that flow anxieties fears which must be all herself she found on reaching home that she had as she intended escaped seeing mr elliot that he had called paid them long morning visit but hardly had she congratulated herself felt safe when she heard that he was coming again evening i had not smallest intention asking him said elizabeth with affected carelessness but he gave so many hints so mrs clay says at least indeed i do say it i never saw anybody my life spell harder for invitation poor man i was really pain for him for your hard hearted sister miss anne seems bent on cruelty oh cried elizabeth i have been rather too much used game be soon overcome by gentleman s hints however when i found how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this morning i gave way immediately for i would never really omit opportunity bringing him sir walter together they appear so much advantage company with each other each behaving so pleasantly mr elliot looking up with so much respect quite delightful cried mrs clay not daring however turn her eyes towards anne exactly like father son dear miss elliot may i not say father son oh i lay no embargo on any body s words if you will have such ideas but upon my word i am scarcely sensible his attentions being beyond those other men my dear miss elliot exclaimed mrs clay lifting her hands eyes sinking all rest her astonishment convenient silence well my dear penelope you need not be so alarmed about him i did invite him you know i sent him away with smiles when i found he was really going his friends at thornberry park for whole day morrow i had compassion on him anne admired good acting friend being able shew such pleasure as she did expectation actual arrival very person whose presence must really be interfering with her prime object it was impossible but that mrs clay must hate sight mr elliot yet she could assume most obliging placid look appear quite satisfied with curtailed license devoting herself only half as much sir walter as she would have done otherwise anne herself it was most distressing see mr elliot enter room quite painful have him approach speak her she had been used before feel that he could not be always quite sincere but now she saw insincerity everything his attentive deference her father contrasted with his former language was odious when she thought his cruel conduct towards mrs smith she could hardly bear sight his present smiles mildness or sound his artificial good sentiments she meant avoid any such alteration manners as might provoke remonstrance on his side it was great object her escape all enquiry or eclat but it was her intention be as decidedly cool him as might be compatible with their relationship retrace as quietly as she could few steps unnecessary intimacy she had been gradually led along she was accordingly more guarded more cool than she had been night before he wanted animate her curiosity again as how where he could have heard her formerly praised wanted very much be gratified by more solicitation but charm was broken he found that heat animation public room was necessary kindle his modest cousin s vanity he found at least that it was not be done now by any those attempts which he could hazard among too commanding claims others he little surmised that it was subject acting now exactly against his interest bringing immediately her thoughts all those parts his conduct which were least excusable she had some satisfaction finding that he was really going out bath next morning going early that he would be gone greater part two days he was invited again camden place very evening his return but from thursday saturday evening his absence was certain it was bad enough that mrs clay should be always before her but that deeper hypocrite should be added their party seemed destruction everything like peace comfort it was so humiliating reflect on constant deception practised on her father elizabeth consider various sources mortification preparing for them mrs clay s selfishness was not so complicate nor so revolting as his anne would have compounded for marriage at once with all its evils be clear mr elliot s subtleties endeavouring prevent it on friday morning she meant go very early lady russell accomplish necessary communication she would have gone directly after breakfast but that mrs clay was also going out on some obliging purpose saving her sister trouble which determined her wait till she might be safe from such companion she saw mrs clay fairly off therefore before she began talk spending morning rivers street very well said elizabeth i have nothing send but my love oh you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me pretend i have read it through i really cannot be plaguing myself for ever with all new poems states nation that come out lady russell quite bores one with her new publications you need not tell her so but i thought her dress hideous other night i used think she had some taste dress but i was ashamed her at concert something so formal arrang her air she sits so upright my best love course mine added sir walter kindest regards you may say that i mean call upon her soon make civil message but i shall only leave my card morning visits are never fair by women at her time life who make themselves up so little if she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid being seen but last time i called i observed blinds were let down immediately while her father spoke there was knock at door who could it be anne remembering preconcerted visits at all hours mr elliot would have expected him but for his known engagement seven miles off after usual period suspense usual sounds approach were heard mr mrs charles musgrove were ushered into room surprise was strongest emotion raised by their appearance but anne was really glad see them others were not so sorry but that they could put on decent air welcome as soon as it became clear that these their nearest relations were not arrived with any views accommodation that house sir walter elizabeth were able rise cordiality do honours it very well they were come bath for few days with mrs musgrove were at white hart so much was pretty soon understood but till sir walter elizabeth were walking mary into other drawing room regaling themselves with her admiration anne could not draw upon charles s brain for regular history their coming or explanation some smiling hints particular business which had been ostentatiously dropped by mary as well as some apparent confusion as whom their party consisted she then found that it consisted mrs musgrove henrietta captain harville beside their two selves he gave her very plain intelligible account whole narration which she saw great deal most characteristic proceeding scheme had received its first impulse by captain harville s wanting come bath on business he had begun talk it week ago by way doing something as shooting was over charles had proposed coming with him mrs harville had seemed like idea it very much as advantage her husband but mary could not bear be left had made herself so unhappy about it that for day or two everything seemed be suspense or at end but then it had been taken up by his father mother his mother had some old friends bath whom she wanted see it was thought good opportunity for henrietta come buy wedding clothes for herself her sister short it ended being his mother s party that everything might be comfortable easy captain harville he mary were included it by way general convenience they had arrived late night before mrs harville her children captain benwick remained with mr musgrove louisa at uppercross anne s only surprise was that affairs should be forwardness enough for henrietta s wedding clothes be talked she had imagined such difficulties fortune exist there as must prevent marriage from being near at hand but she learned from charles that very recently since mary s last letter herself charles hayter had been applied by friend hold living for youth who could not possibly claim it under many years that on strength his present income with almost certainty something more permanent long before term question two families had consented young people s wishes that their marriage was likely take place few months quite as soon as louisa s very good living it was charles added only five twenty miles from uppercross very fine country fine part dorsetshire centre some best preserves kingdom surrounded by three great proprietors each more careful jealous than other two three at least charles hayter might get special recommendation not that he will value it as he ought he observed charles is too cool about sporting that s worst him i am extremely glad indeed cried anne particularly glad that this should happen that two sisters who both deserve equally well who have always been such good friends pleasant prospect one should not be dimming those other that they should be so equal their prosperity comfort i hope your father mother are quite happy with regard both oh yes my father would be well pleased if gentlemen were richer but he has no other fault find money you know coming down with money two daughters at once it cannot be very agreeable operation it streightens him as many things however i do not mean say they have not right it it is very fit they should have daughters shares i am sure he has always been very kind liberal father me mary does not above half like henrietta s match she never did you know but she does not do him justice nor think enough about winthrop i cannot make her attend value property it is very fair match as times go i have liked charles hayter all my life i shall not leave off now such excellent parents as mr mrs musgrove exclaimed anne should be happy their children s marriages they do everything confer happiness i am sure what blessing young people be such hands your father mother seem so totally free from all those ambitious feelings which have led so much misconduct misery both young old i hope you think louisa perfectly recovered now he answered rather hesitatingly yes i believe i do very much recovered but she is altered there is no running or jumping about no laughing or dancing it is quite different if one happens only shut door little hard she starts wriggles like young dab chick water benwick sits at her elbow reading verses or whispering her all day long anne could not help laughing that cannot be much your taste i know said she but i do believe him be excellent young man be sure he is nobody doubts it i hope you do not think i am so illiberal as want every man have same objects pleasures as myself i have great value for benwick when one can but get him talk he has plenty say his reading has done him no harm for he has fought as well as read he is brave fellow i got more acquainted with him last monday than ever i did before we had famous set at rat hunting all morning my father s great barns he played his part so well that i have liked him better ever since here they were interrupted by absolute necessity charles s following others admire mirrors china but anne had heard enough understand present state uppercross rejoice its happiness though she sighed as she rejoiced her sigh had none ill will envy it she would certainly have risen their blessings if she could but she did not want lessen theirs visit passed off altogether high good humour mary was excellent spirits enjoying gaiety change so well satisfied with journey her mother law s carriage with four horses with her own complete independence camden place that she was exactly temper admire everything as she ought enter most readily into all superiorities house as they were detailed her she had no demands on her father or sister her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome drawing rooms elizabeth was for short time suffering good deal she felt that mrs musgrove all her party ought be asked dine with them but she could not bear have difference style reduction servants which dinner must betray witnessed by those who had been always so inferior elliots kellynch it was struggle between propriety vanity but vanity got better then elizabeth was happy again these were her internal persuasions old fashioned notions country hospitality we do not profess give dinners few people bath do lady alicia never does did not even ask her own sister s family though they were here month i dare say it would be very inconvenient mrs musgrove put her quite out her way i am sure she would rather not come she cannot feel easy with us i will ask them all for evening that will be much better that will be novelty treat they have not seen two such drawing rooms before they will be delighted come morrow evening it shall be regular party small but most elegant this satisfied elizabeth when invitation was given two present promised for absent mary was as completely satisfied she was particularly asked meet mr elliot be introduced lady dalrymple miss carteret who were fortunately already engaged come she could not have received more gratifying attention miss elliot was have honour calling on mrs musgrove course morning anne walked off with charles mary go see her henrietta directly her plan sitting with lady russell must give way for present they all three called rivers street for couple minutes but anne convinced herself that day s delay intended communication could be no consequence hastened forward white hart see again friends companions last autumn with eagerness good will which many associations contributed form they found mrs musgrove her daughter within by themselves anne had kindest welcome from each henrietta was exactly that state recently improved views fresh formed happiness which made her full regard interest for everybody she had ever liked before at all mrs musgrove s real affection had been won by her usefulness when they were distress it was heartiness warmth sincerity which anne delighted more from sad want such blessings at home she was entreated give them as much her time as possible invited for every day all day long or rather claimed as part family return she naturally fell into all her wonted ways attention assistance on charles s leaving them together was listening mrs musgrove s history louisa henrietta s herself giving opinions on business recommendations shops with intervals every help which mary required from altering her ribbon settling her accounts from finding her keys assorting her trinkets trying convince her that she was not ill used by anybody which mary well amused as she generally was her station at window overlooking entrance pump room could not but have her moments imagining morning thorough confusion was be expected large party hotel ensured quick changing unsettled scene one five minutes brought note next parcel anne had not been there half hour when their dining room spacious as it was seemed more than half filled party steady old friends were seated around mrs musgrove charles came back with captains harville wentworth appearance latter could not be more than surprise moment it was impossible for her have forgotten feel that this arrival their common friends must be soon bringing them together again their last meeting had been most important opening his feelings she had derived from it delightful conviction but she feared from his looks that same unfortunate persuasion which had hastened him away from concert room still governed he did not seem want be near enough for conversation she tried be calm leave things take their course tried dwell much on this argument rational dependence surely if there be constant attachment on each side our hearts must understand each other ere long we are not boy girl be captiously irritable misled by every moment s inadvertence wantonly playing with our own happiness yet few minutes afterwards she felt as if their being company with each other under their present circumstances could only be exposing them inadvertencies misconstructions most mischievous kind anne cried mary still at her window there is mrs clay i am sure standing under colonnade gentleman with her i saw them turn corner from bath street just now they seemed deep talk who is it come tell me good heavens i recollect it is mr elliot himself no cried anne quickly it cannot be mr elliot i assure you he was leave bath at nine this morning does not come back till morrow as she spoke she felt that captain wentworth was looking at her consciousness which vexed embarrassed her made her regret that she had said so much simple as it was mary resenting that she should be supposed not know her own cousin began talking very warmly about family features protesting still more positively that it was mr elliot calling again upon anne come look for herself but anne did not mean stir tried be cool unconcerned her distress returned however on perceiving smiles intelligent glances pass between two or three lady visitors as if they believed themselves quite secret it was evident that report concerning her had spread short pause succeeded which seemed ensure that it would now spread farther do come anne cried mary come look yourself you will be too late if you do not make haste they are parting they are shaking hands he is turning away not know mr elliot indeed you seem have forgot all about lyme pacify mary perhaps screen her own embarrassment anne did move quietly window she was just time ascertain that it really was mr elliot which she had never believed before he disappeared on one side as mrs clay walked quickly off on other checking surprise which she could not but feel at such appearance friendly conference between two persons totally opposite interest she calmly said yes it is mr elliot certainly he has changed his hour going i suppose that is all or i may be mistaken i might not attend walked back her chair recomposed with comfortable hope having acquitted herself well visitors took their leave charles having civilly seen them off then made face at them abused them for coming began with well mother i have done something for you that you will like i have been theatre secured box for morrow night n t i good boy i know you love play there is room for us all it holds nine i have engaged captain wentworth anne will not be sorry join us i am sure we all like play have not i done well mother mrs musgrove was good humouredly beginning express her perfect readiness for play if henrietta all others liked it when mary eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming good heavens charles how can you think such thing take box for morrow night have you forgot that we are engaged camden place morrow night that we were most particularly asked meet lady dalrymple her daughter mr elliot all principal family connexions on purpose be introduced them how can you be so forgetful phoo phoo replied charles what s evening party never worth remembering your father might have asked us dinner i think if he had wanted see us you may do as you like but i shall go play oh charles i declare it will be too abominable if you do when you promised go no i did not promise i only smirked bowed said word happy there was no promise but you must go charles it would be unpardonable fail we were asked on purpose be introduced there was always such great connexion between dalrymples ourselves nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately we are quite near relations you know mr elliot too whom you ought so particularly be acquainted with every attention is due mr elliot consider my father s heir future representative family don t talk me about heirs representatives cried charles i am not one those who neglect reigning power bow rising sun if i would not go for sake your father i should think it scandalous go for sake his heir what is mr elliot me careless expression was life anne who saw that captain wentworth was all attention looking listening with his whole soul that last words brought his enquiring eyes from charles herself charles mary still talked on same style he half serious half jesting maintaining scheme for play she invariably serious most warmly opposing it not omitting make it known that however determined go camden place herself she should not think herself very well used if they went play without her mrs musgrove interposed we had better put it off charles you had much better go back change box for tuesday it would be pity be divided we should be losing miss anne too if there is party at her father s i am sure neither henrietta nor i should care at all for play if miss anne could not be with us anne felt truly obliged her for such kindness quite as much so for opportunity it gave her decidedly saying if it depended only on my inclination ma am party at home excepting on mary s account would not be smallest impediment i have no pleasure sort meeting should be too happy change it for play with you but it had better not be attempted perhaps she had spoken it but she trembled when it was done conscious that her words were listened daring not even try observe their effect it was soon generally agreed that tuesday should be day charles only reserving advantage still teasing his wife by persisting that he would go play morrow if nobody else would captain wentworth left his seat walked fire place probably for sake walking away from it soon afterwards taking station with less bare faced design by anne you have not been long enough bath said he enjoy evening parties place oh no usual character them has nothing for me i am no card player you were not formerly i know you did not use like cards but time makes many changes i am not yet so much changed cried anne stopped fearing she hardly knew what misconstruction after waiting few moments he said as if it were result immediate feeling it is period indeed eight years half is period whether he would have proceeded farther was left anne s imagination ponder over calmer hour for while still hearing sounds he had uttered she was startled other subjects by henrietta eager make use present leisure for getting out calling on her companions lose no time lest somebody else should come they were obliged move anne talked being perfectly ready tried look it but she felt that could henrietta have known regret reluctance her heart quitting that chair preparing quit room she would have found all her own sensations for her cousin very security his affection wherewith pity her their preparations however were stopped short alarming sounds were heard other visitors approached door was thrown open for sir walter miss elliot whose entrance seemed give general chill anne felt instant oppression wherever she looked saw symptoms same comfort freedom gaiety room was over hushed into cold composure determined silence or insipid talk meet heartless elegance her father sister how mortifying feel that it was so her jealous eye was satisfied one particular captain wentworth was acknowledged again by each by elizabeth more graciously than before she even addressed him once looked at him more than once elizabeth was fact revolving great measure sequel explained it after waste few minutes saying proper nothings she began give invitation which was comprise all remaining dues musgroves morrow evening meet few friends no formal party it was all said very gracefully cards with which she had provided herself miss elliot at home were laid on table with courteous comprehensive smile all one smile one card more decidedly for captain wentworth truth was that elizabeth had been long enough bath understand importance man such air appearance as his past was nothing present was that captain wentworth would move about well her drawing room card was pointedly given sir walter elizabeth arose disappeared interruption had been short though severe ease animation returned most those they left as door shut them out but not anne she could think only invitation she had with such astonishment witnessed manner which it had been received manner doubtful meaning surprise rather than gratification polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance she knew him she saw disdain his eye could not venture believe that he had determined accept such offering as atonement for all insolence past her spirits sank he held card his hand after they were gone as if deeply considering it only think elizabeth s including everybody whispered mary very audibly i do not wonder captain wentworth is delighted you see he cannot put card out his hand anne caught his eye saw his cheeks glow his mouth form itself into momentary expression contempt turned away that she might neither see nor hear more vex her party separated gentlemen had their own pursuits ladies proceeded on their own business they met no more while anne belonged them she was earnestly begged return dine give them all rest day but her spirits had been so long exerted that at present she felt unequal more fit only for home where she might be sure being as silent as she chose promising be with them whole following morning therefore she closed fatigues present by toilsome walk camden place there spend evening chiefly listening busy arrangements elizabeth mrs clay for morrow s party frequent enumeration persons invited continually improving detail all embellishments which were make it most completely elegant its kind bath while harassing herself with never ending question whether captain wentworth would come or not they were reckoning him as certain but with her it was gnawing solicitude never appeased for five minutes together she generally thought he would come because she generally thought he ought but it was case which she could not so shape into any positive act duty or discretion as inevitably defy suggestions very opposite feelings she only roused herself from broodings this restless agitation let mrs clay know that she had been seen with mr elliot three hours after his being supposed be out bath for having watched vain for some intimation interview from lady herself she determined mention it it seemed her there was guilt mrs clay s face as she listened it was transient cleared away instant but anne could imagine she read there consciousness having by some complication mutual trick or some overbearing authority his been obliged attend perhaps for half hour his lectures restrictions on her designs on sir walter she exclaimed however with very tolerable imitation nature oh dear very true only think miss elliot my great surprise i met with mr elliot bath street i was never more astonished he turned back walked with me pump yard he had been prevented setting off for thornberry but i really forget by what for i was hurry could not much attend i can only answer for his being determined not be delayed his return he wanted know how early he might be admitted morrow he was full morrow it is very evident that i have been full it too ever since i entered house learnt extension your plan all that had happened or my seeing him could never have gone so entirely out my head chapter xxiii one day only had passed since anne s conversation with mrs smith but keener interest had succeeded she was now so little touched by mr elliot s conduct except by its effects one quarter that it became matter course next morning still defer her explanatory visit rivers street she had promised be with musgroves from breakfast dinner her faith was plighted mr elliot s character like sultaness scheherazade s head must live another day she could not keep her appointment punctually however weather was unfavourable she had grieved over rain on her friends account felt it very much on her own before she was able attempt walk when she reached white hart made her way proper apartment she found herself neither arriving quite time nor first arrive party before her were mrs musgrove talking mrs croft captain harville captain wentworth she immediately heard that mary henrietta too impatient wait had gone out moment it had cleared but would be back again soon that strictest injunctions had been left with mrs musgrove keep her there till they returned she had only submit sit down be outwardly composed feel herself plunged at once all agitations which she had merely laid her account tasting little before morning closed there was no delay no waste time she was deep happiness such misery or misery such happiness instantly two minutes after her entering room captain wentworth said we will write letter we were talking harville now if you will give me materials materials were at hand on separate table he went it nearly turning his back them all was engrossed by writing mrs musgrove was giving mrs croft history her eldest daughter s engagement just that inconvenient tone voice which was perfectly audible while it pretended be whisper anne felt that she did not belong conversation yet as captain harville seemed thoughtful not disposed talk she could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars such as how mr musgrove my brother hayter had met again again talk it over what my brother hayter had said one day what mr musgrove had proposed next what had occurred my sister hayter what young people had wished what i said at first i never could consent but was afterwards persuaded think might do very well great deal same style open hearted communication minutiae which even with every advantage taste delicacy which good mrs musgrove could not give could be properly interesting only principals mrs croft was attending with great good humour whenever she spoke at all it was very sensibly anne hoped gentlemen might each be too much self occupied hear so ma am all these thing considered said mrs musgrove her powerful whisper though we could have wished it different yet altogether we did not think it fair stand out any longer for charles hayter was quite wild about it henrietta was pretty near as bad so we thought they had better marry at once make best it as many others have done before them at any rate said i it will be better than long engagement that is precisely what i was going observe cried mrs croft i would rather have young people settle on small income at once have struggle with few difficulties together than be involved long engagement i always think that no mutual oh dear mrs croft cried mrs musgrove unable let her finish her speech there is nothing i so abominate for young people as long engagement it is what i always protested against for my children it is all very well i used say for young people be engaged if there is certainty their being able marry six months or even twelve but long engagement yes dear ma am said mrs croft or uncertain engagement engagement which may be long begin without knowing that at such time there will be means marrying i hold be very unsafe unwise what i think all parents should prevent as far as they can anne found unexpected interest here she felt its application herself felt it nervous thrill all over her at same moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards distant table captain wentworth s pen ceased move his head was raised pausing listening he turned round next instant give look one quick conscious look at her two ladies continued talk re urge same admitted truths enforce them with such examples ill effect contrary practice as had fallen within their observation but anne heard nothing distinctly it was only buzz words her ear her mind was confusion captain harville who had truth been hearing none it now left his seat moved window anne seeming watch him though it was from thorough absence mind became gradually sensible that he was inviting her join him where he stood he looked at her with smile little motion head which expressed come me i have something say unaffected easy kindness manner which denoted feelings older acquaintance than he really was strongly enforced invitation she roused herself went him window at which he stood was at other end room from where two ladies were sitting though nearer captain wentworth s table not very near as she joined him captain harville s countenance re assumed serious thoughtful expression which seemed its natural character look here said he unfolding parcel his hand displaying small miniature painting do you know who that is certainly captain benwick yes you may guess who it is for but deep tone it was not done for her miss elliot do you remember our walking together at lyme grieving for him i little thought then but no matter this was drawn at cape he met with clever young german artist at cape compliance with promise my poor sister sat him was bringing it home for her i have now charge getting it properly set for another it was commission me but who else was there employ i hope i can allow for him i am not sorry indeed make it over another he undertakes it looking towards captain wentworth he is writing about it now with quivering lip he wound up whole by adding poor fanny she would not have forgotten him so soon no replied anne low feeling voice that i can easily believe it was not her nature she doted on him it would not be nature any woman who truly loved captain harville smiled as much as say do you claim that for your sex she answered question smiling also yes we certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us it is perhaps our fate rather than our merit we cannot help ourselves we live at home quiet confined our feelings prey upon us you are forced on exertion you have always profession pursuits business some sort or other take you back into world immediately continual occupation change soon weaken impressions granting your assertion that world does all this so soon for men which however i do not think i shall grant it does not apply benwick he has not been forced upon any exertion peace turned him on shore at very moment he has been living with us our little family circle ever since true said anne very true i did not recollect but what shall we say now captain harville if change be not from outward circumstances it must be from within it must be nature man s nature which has done business for captain benwick no no it is not man s nature i will not allow it be more man s nature than woman s be inconstant forget those they do love or have loved i believe reverse i believe true analogy between our bodily frames our mental that as our bodies are strongest so are our feelings capable bearing most rough usage riding out heaviest weather your feelings may be strongest replied anne but same spirit analogy will authorise me assert that ours are most tender man is more robust than woman but he is not longer lived which exactly explains my view nature their attachments nay it would be too hard upon you if it were otherwise you have difficulties privations dangers enough struggle with you are always labouring toiling exposed every risk hardship your home country friends all quitted neither time nor health nor life be called your own it would be hard indeed with faltering voice if woman s feelings were be added all this we shall never agree upon this question captain harville was beginning say when slight noise called their attention captain wentworth s hitherto perfectly quiet division room it was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down but anne was startled at finding him nearer than she had supposed half inclined suspect that pen had only fallen because he had been occupied by them striving catch sounds which yet she did not think he could have caught have you finished your letter said captain harville not quite few lines more i shall have done five minutes there is no hurry on my side i am only ready whenever you are i am very good anchorage here smiling at anne well supplied want for nothing no hurry for signal at all well miss elliot lowering his voice as i was saying we shall never agree i suppose upon this point no man woman would probably but let me observe that all histories are against you all stories prose verse if i had such memory as benwick i could bring you fifty quotations moment on my side argument i do not think i ever opened book my life which had not something say upon woman s inconstancy songs proverbs all talk woman s fickleness but perhaps you will say these were all written by men perhaps i shall yes yes if you please no reference examples books men have had every advantage us telling their own story education has been theirs so much higher degree pen has been their hands i will not allow books prove anything but how shall we prove anything we never shall we never can expect prove any thing upon such point it is difference opinion which does not admit proof we each begin probably with little bias towards our own sex upon that bias build every circumstance favour it which has occurred within our own circle many which circumstances perhaps those very cases which strike us most may be precisely such as cannot be brought forward without betraying confidence or some respect saying what should not be said ah cried captain harville tone strong feeling if i could but make you comprehend what man suffers when he takes last look at his wife children watches boat that he has sent them off as long as it is sight then turns away says god knows whether we ever meet again then if i could convey you glow his soul when he does see them again when coming back after twelvemonth s absence perhaps obliged put into another port he calculates how soon it be possible get them there pretending deceive himself saying they cannot be here till such day but all while hoping for them twelve hours sooner seeing them arrive at last as if heaven had given them wings by many hours sooner still if i could explain you all this all that man can bear do glories do for sake these treasures his existence i speak you know only such men as have hearts pressing his own with emotion oh cried anne eagerly i hope i do justice all that is felt by you by those who resemble you god forbid that i should undervalue warm faithful feelings any my fellow creatures i should deserve utter contempt if i dared suppose that true attachment constancy were known only by woman no i believe you capable everything great good your married lives i believe you equal every important exertion every domestic forbearance so long as if i may be allowed expression so long as you have object i mean while woman you love lives lives for you all privilege i claim for my own sex it is not very enviable one you need not covet it is that loving longest when existence or when hope is gone she could not immediately have uttered another sentence her heart was too full her breath too much oppressed you are good soul cried captain harville putting his hand on her arm quite affectionately there is no quarrelling with you when i think benwick my tongue is tied their attention was called towards others mrs croft was taking leave here frederick you i part company i believe said she i am going home you have engagement with your friend night we may have pleasure all meeting again at your party turning anne we had your sister s card yesterday i understood frederick had card too though i did not see it you are disengaged frederick are you not as well as ourselves captain wentworth was folding up letter great haste either could not or would not answer fully yes said he very true here we separate but harville i shall soon be after you that is harville if you are ready i am half minute i know you will not be sorry be off i shall be at your service half minute mrs croft left them captain wentworth having sealed his letter with great rapidity was indeed ready had even hurried agitated air which shewed impatience be gone anne knew not how understand it she had kindest good morning god bless you from captain harville but from him not word nor look he had passed out room without look she had only time however move closer table where he had been writing when footsteps were heard returning door opened it was himself he begged their pardon but he had forgotten his gloves instantly crossing room writing table he drew out letter from under scattered paper placed it before anne with eyes glowing entreaty fixed on her for time hastily collecting his gloves was again out room almost before mrs musgrove was aware his being it work instant revolution which one instant had made anne was almost beyond expression letter with direction hardly legible miss e was evidently one which he had been folding so hastily while supposed be writing only captain benwick he had been also addressing her on contents that letter depended all which this world could do for her anything was possible anything might be defied rather than suspense mrs musgrove had little arrangements her own at her own table their protection she must trust sinking into chair which he had occupied succeeding very spot where he had leaned written her eyes devoured following words i can listen no longer silence i must speak you by such means as are within my reach you pierce my soul i am half agony half hope tell me not that i am too late that such precious feelings are gone for ever i offer myself you again with heart even more your own than when you almost broke it eight years half ago dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman that his love has earlier death i have loved none but you unjust i may have been weak resentful i have been but never inconstant you alone have brought me bath for you alone i think plan have you not seen this can you fail have understood my wishes i had not waited even these ten days could i have read your feelings as i think you must have penetrated mine i can hardly write i am every instant hearing something which overpowers me you sink your voice but i can distinguish tones that voice when they would be lost on others too good too excellent creature you do us justice indeed you do believe that there is true attachment constancy among men believe it be most fervent most undeviating f w i must go uncertain my fate but i shall return hither or follow your party as soon as possible word look will be enough decide whether i enter your father s house this evening or never such letter was not be soon recovered from half hour s solitude reflection might have tranquillized her but ten minutes only which now passed before she was interrupted with all restraints her situation could do nothing towards tranquillity every moment rather brought fresh agitation it was overpowering happiness before she was beyond first stage full sensation charles mary henrietta all came absolute necessity seeming like herself produced then immediate struggle but after while she could do no more she began not understand word they said was obliged plead indisposition excuse herself they could then see that she looked very ill were shocked concerned would not stir without her for world this was dreadful would they only have gone away left her quiet possession that room it would have been her cure but have them all standing or waiting around her was distracting desperation she said she would go home by all means my dear cried mrs musgrove go home directly take care yourself that you may be fit for evening i wish sarah was here doctor you but i am no doctor myself charles ring order chair she must not walk but chair would never do worse than all lose possibility speaking two words captain wentworth course her quiet solitary progress up town she felt almost certain meeting him could not be borne chair was earnestly protested against mrs musgrove who thought only one sort illness having assured herself with some anxiety that there had been no fall case that anne had not at any time lately slipped down got blow on her head that she was perfectly convinced having had no fall could part with her cheerfully depend on finding her better at night anxious omit no possible precaution anne struggled said i am afraid ma am that it is not perfectly understood pray be so good as mention other gentlemen that we hope see your whole party this evening i am afraid there had been some mistake i wish you particularly assure captain harville captain wentworth that we hope see them both oh my dear it is quite understood i give you my word captain harville has no thought but going do you think so but i am afraid i should be so very sorry will you promise me mention it when you see them again you will see them both this morning i dare say do promise me be sure i will if you wish it charles if you see captain harville anywhere remember give miss anne s message but indeed my dear you need not be uneasy captain harville holds himself quite engaged i ll answer for it captain wentworth same i dare say anne could do no more but her heart prophesied some mischance damp perfection her felicity it could not be very lasting however even if he did not come camden place himself it would be her power send intelligible sentence by captain harville another momentary vexation occurred charles his real concern good nature would go home with her there was no preventing him this was almost cruel but she could not be long ungrateful he was sacrificing engagement at gunsmith s be use her she set off with him with no feeling but gratitude apparent they were on union street when quicker step behind something familiar sound gave her two moments preparation for sight captain wentworth he joined them but as if irresolute whether join or pass on said nothing only looked anne could command herself enough receive that look not repulsively cheeks which had been pale now glowed movements which had hesitated were decided he walked by her side presently struck by sudden thought charles said captain wentworth which way are you going only gay street or farther up town i hardly know replied captain wentworth surprised are you going as high as belmont are you going near camden place because if you are i shall have no scruple asking you take my place give anne your arm her father s door she is rather done for this morning must not go so far without help i ought be at that fellow s market place he promised me sight capital gun he is just going send off said he would keep it unpacked last possible moment that i might see it if i do not turn back now i have no chance by his description good deal like second size double barrel mine which you shot with one day round winthrop there could not be objection there could be only most proper alacrity most obliging compliance for public view smiles reined spirits dancing private rapture half minute charles was at bottom union street again other two proceeding together soon words enough had passed between them decide their direction towards comparatively quiet retired gravel walk where power conversation would make present hour blessing indeed prepare it for all immortality which happiest recollections their own future lives could bestow there they exchanged again those feelings those promises which had once before seemed secure everything but which had been followed by so many many years division estrangement there they returned again into past more exquisitely happy perhaps their re union than when it had been first projected more tender more tried more fixed knowledge each other s character truth attachment more equal act more justified acting there as they slowly paced gradual ascent heedless every group around them seeing neither sauntering politicians bustling housekeepers flirting girls nor nursery maids children they could indulge those retrospections acknowledgements especially those explanations what had directly preceded present moment which were so poignant so ceaseless interest all little variations last week were gone through yesterday day there could scarcely be end she had not mistaken him jealousy mr elliot had been retarding weight doubt torment that had begun operate very hour first meeting her bath that had returned after short suspension ruin concert that had influenced him everything he had said done or omitted say do last four twenty hours it had been gradually yielding better hopes which her looks or words or actions occasionally encouraged it had been vanquished at last by those sentiments those tones which had reached him while she talked with captain harville under irresistible governance which he had seized sheet paper poured out his feelings what he had then written nothing was be retracted or qualified he persisted having loved none but her she had never been supplanted he never even believed himself see her equal thus much indeed he was obliged acknowledge that he had been constant unconsciously nay unintentionally that he had meant forget her believed it be done he had imagined himself indifferent when he had only been angry he had been unjust her merits because he had been sufferer from them her character was now fixed on his mind as perfection itself maintaining loveliest medium fortitude gentleness but he was obliged acknowledge that only at uppercross had he learnt do her justice only at lyme had he begun understand himself at lyme he had received lessons more than one sort passing admiration mr elliot had at least roused him scenes on cobb at captain harville s had fixed her superiority his preceding attempts attach himself louisa musgrove attempts angry pride he protested that he had for ever felt it be impossible that he had not cared could not care for louisa though till that day till leisure for reflection which followed it he had not understood perfect excellence mind with which louisa s could so ill bear comparison or perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own there he had learnt distinguish between steadiness principle obstinacy self will between darings heedlessness resolution collected mind there he had seen everything exalt his estimation woman he had lost there begun deplore pride folly madness resentment which had kept him from trying regain her when thrown his way from that period his penance had become severe he had no sooner been free from horror remorse attending first few days louisa s accident no sooner begun feel himself alive again than he had begun feel himself though alive not at liberty i found said he that i was considered by harville engaged man that neither harville nor his wife entertained doubt our mutual attachment i was startled shocked degree i could contradict this instantly but when i began reflect that others might have felt same her own family nay perhaps herself i was no longer at my own disposal i was hers honour if she wished it i had been unguarded i had not thought seriously on this subject before i had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its danger ill consequence many ways that i had no right be trying whether i could attach myself either girls at risk raising even unpleasant report were there no other ill effects i had been grossly wrong must abide consequences he found too late short that he had entangled himself that precisely as he became fully satisfied his not caring for louisa at all he must regard himself as bound her if her sentiments for him were what harvilles supposed it determined him leave lyme await her complete recovery elsewhere he would gladly weaken by any fair means whatever feelings or speculations concerning him might exist he went therefore his brother s meaning after while return kellynch act as circumstances might require i was six weeks with edward said he saw him happy i could have no other pleasure i deserved none he enquired after you very particularly asked even if you were personally altered little suspecting that my eye you could never alter anne smiled let it pass it was too pleasing blunder for reproach it is something for woman be assured her eight twentieth year that she has not lost one charm earlier youth but value such homage was inexpressibly increased anne by comparing it with former words feeling it be result not cause revival his warm attachment he had remained shropshire lamenting blindness his own pride blunders his own calculations till at once released from louisa by astonishing felicitous intelligence her engagement with benwick here said he ended worst my state for now i could at least put myself way happiness i could exert myself i could do something but be waiting so long inaction waiting only for evil had been dreadful within first five minutes i said i will be at bath on wednesday i was was it unpardonable think it worth my while come arrive with some degree hope you were single it was possible that you might retain feelings past as i did one encouragement happened be mine i could never doubt that you would be loved sought by others but i knew certainty that you had refused one man at least better pretensions than myself i could not help often saying was this for me their first meeting milsom street afforded much be said but concert still more that evening seemed be made up exquisite moments moment her stepping forward octagon room speak him moment mr elliot s appearing tearing her away one or two subsequent moments marked by returning hope or increasing despondency were dwelt on with energy see you cried he midst those who could not be my well wishers see your cousin close by you conversing smiling feel all horrible eligibilities proprieties match consider it as certain wish every being who could hope influence you even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent consider what powerful supports would be his was it not enough make fool me which i appeared how could i look on without agony was not very sight friend who sat behind you was not recollection what had been knowledge her influence indelible immoveable impression what persuasion had once done was it not all against me you should have distinguished replied anne you should not have suspected me now case is so different my age is so different if i was wrong yielding persuasion once remember that it was persuasion exerted on side safety not risk when i yielded i thought it was duty but no duty could be called aid here marrying man indifferent me all risk would have been incurred all duty violated perhaps i ought have reasoned thus he replied but i could not i could not derive benefit from late knowledge i had acquired your character i could not bring it into play it was overwhelmed buried lost those earlier feelings which i had been smarting under year after year i could think you only as one who had yielded who had given me up who had been influenced by any one rather than by me i saw you with very person who had guided you that year misery i had no reason believe her less authority now force habit was be added i should have thought said anne that my manner yourself might have spared you much or all this no no your manner might be only ease which your engagement another man would give i left you this belief yet i was determined see you again my spirits rallied with morning i felt that i had still motive for remaining here at last anne was at home again happier than any one that house could have conceived all surprise suspense every other painful part morning dissipated by this conversation she re entered house so happy as be obliged find alloy some momentary apprehensions its being impossible last interval meditation serious grateful was best corrective everything dangerous such high wrought felicity she went her room grew steadfast fearless thankfulness her enjoyment evening came drawing rooms were lighted up company assembled it was but card party it was but mixture those who had never met before those who met too often commonplace business too numerous for intimacy too small for variety but anne had never found evening shorter glowing lovely sensibility happiness more generally admired than she thought about or cared for she had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her mr elliot was there she avoided but she could pity him wallises she had amusement understanding them lady dalrymple miss carteret they would soon be innoxious cousins her she cared not for mrs clay had nothing blush for public manners her father sister with musgroves there was happy chat perfect ease with captain harville kind hearted intercourse brother sister with lady russell attempts at conversation which delicious consciousness cut short with admiral mrs croft everything peculiar cordiality fervent interest which same consciousness sought conceal with captain wentworth some moments communications continually occurring always hope more always knowledge his being there it was one these short meetings each apparently occupied admiring fine display greenhouse plants that she said i have been thinking over past trying impartially judge right wrong i mean with regard myself i must believe that i was right much as i suffered from it that i was perfectly right being guided by friend whom you will love better than you do now me she was place parent do not mistake me however i am not saying that she did not err her advice it was perhaps one those cases which advice is good or bad only as event decides for myself i certainly never should any circumstance tolerable similarity give such advice but i mean that i was right submitting her that if i had done otherwise i should have suffered more continuing engagement than i did even giving it up because i should have suffered my conscience i have now as far as such sentiment is allowable human nature nothing reproach myself with if i mistake not strong sense duty is no bad part woman s portion he looked at her looked at lady russell looking again at her replied as if cool deliberation not yet but there are hopes her being forgiven time i trust being charity with her soon but i too have been thinking over past question has suggested itself whether there may not have been one person more my enemy even than that lady my own self tell me if when i returned england year eight with few thousand pounds was posted into laconia if i had then written you would you have answered my letter would you short have renewed engagement then would i was all her answer but accent was decisive enough good god he cried you would it is not that i did not think it or desire it as what could alone crown all my other success but i was proud too proud ask again i did not understand you i shut my eyes would not understand you or do you justice this is recollection which ought make me forgive every one sooner than myself six years separation suffering might have been spared it is sort pain too which is new me i have been used gratification believing myself earn every blessing that i enjoyed i have valued myself on honourable toils just rewards like other great men under reverses he added with smile i must endeavour subdue my mind my fortune i must learn brook being happier than i deserve chapter xxiv who can be doubt what followed when any two young people take it into their heads marry they are pretty sure by perseverance carry their point be they ever so poor or ever so imprudent or ever so little likely be necessary each other s ultimate comfort this may be bad morality conclude with but i believe it be truth if such parties succeed how should captain wentworth anne elliot with advantage maturity mind consciousness right one independent fortune between them fail bearing down every opposition they might fact have borne down great deal more than they met with for there was little distress them beyond want graciousness warmth sir walter made no objection elizabeth did nothing worse than look cold unconcerned captain wentworth with five twenty thousand pounds as high his profession as merit activity could place him was no longer nobody he was now esteemed quite worthy address daughter foolish spendthrift baronet who had not had principle or sense enough maintain himself situation which providence had placed him who could give his daughter at present but small part share ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter sir walter indeed though he had no affection for anne no vanity flattered make him really happy on occasion was very far from thinking it bad match for her on contrary when he saw more captain wentworth saw him repeatedly by daylight eyed him well he was very much struck by his personal claims felt that his superiority appearance might be not unfairly balanced against her superiority rank all this assisted by his well sounding name enabled sir walter at last prepare his pen with very good grace for insertion marriage volume honour only one among them whose opposition feeling could excite any serious anxiety was lady russell anne knew that lady russell must be suffering some pain understanding relinquishing mr elliot be making some struggles become truly acquainted with do justice captain wentworth this however was what lady russell had now do she must learn feel that she had been mistaken with regard both that she had been unfairly influenced by appearances each that because captain wentworth s manners had not suited her own ideas she had been too quick suspecting them indicate character dangerous impetuosity that because mr elliot s manners had precisely pleased her their propriety correctness their general politeness suavity she had been too quick receiving them as certain result most correct opinions well regulated mind there was nothing less for lady russell do than admit that she had been pretty completely wrong take up new set opinions hopes there is quickness perception some nicety discernment character natural penetration short which no experience others can equal lady russell had been less gifted this part understanding than her young friend but she was very good woman if her second object was be sensible well judging her first was see anne happy she loved anne better than she loved her own abilities when awkwardness beginning was over found little hardship attaching herself as mother man who was securing happiness her other child all family mary was probably one most immediately gratified by circumstance it was creditable have sister married she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental connexion by keeping anne with her autumn as her own sister must be better than her husband s sisters it was very agreeable that captain wentworth should be richer man than either captain benwick or charles hayter she had something suffer perhaps when they came into contact again seeing anne restored rights seniority mistress very pretty landaulette but she had future look forward powerful consolation anne had no uppercross hall before her no landed estate no headship family if they could but keep captain wentworth from being made baronet she would not change situations with anne it would be well for eldest sister if she were equally satisfied with her situation for change is not very probable there she had soon mortification seeing mr elliot withdraw no one proper condition has since presented himself raise even unfounded hopes which sunk with him news his cousin anne s engagement burst on mr elliot most unexpectedly it deranged his best plan domestic happiness his best hope keeping sir walter single by watchfulness which son law s rights would have given but though discomfited disappointed he could still do something for his own interest his own enjoyment he soon quitted bath on mrs clay s quitting it soon afterwards being next heard as established under his protection london it was evident how double game he had been playing how determined he was save himself from being cut out by one artful woman at least mrs clay s affections had overpowered her interest she had sacrificed for young man s sake possibility scheming longer for sir walter she has abilities however as well as affections it is now doubtful point whether his cunning or hers may finally carry day whether after preventing her from being wife sir walter he may not be wheedled caressed at last into making her wife sir william it cannot be doubted that sir walter elizabeth were shocked mortified by loss their companion discovery their deception her they had their great cousins be sure resort for comfort but they must long feel that flatter follow others without being flattered followed turn is but state half enjoyment anne satisfied at very early period lady russell s meaning love captain wentworth as she ought had no other alloy happiness her prospects than what arose from consciousness having no relations bestow on him which man sense could value there she felt her own inferiority very keenly disproportion their fortune was nothing it did not give her moment s regret but have no family receive estimate him properly nothing respectability harmony good will offer return for all worth all prompt welcome which met her his brothers sisters was source as lively pain as her mind could well be sensible under circumstances otherwise strong felicity she had but two friends world add his list lady russell mrs smith those however he was very well disposed attach himself lady russell spite all her former transgressions he could now value from his heart while he was not obliged say that he believed her have been right originally dividing them he was ready say almost everything else her favour as for mrs smith she had claims various kinds recommend her quickly permanently her recent good offices by anne had been enough themselves their marriage instead depriving her one friend secured her two she was their earliest visitor their settled life captain wentworth by putting her way recovering her husband s property west indies by writing for her acting for her seeing her through all petty difficulties case with activity exertion fearless man determined friend fully requited services which she had rendered or ever meant render his wife mrs smith s enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement income with some improvement health acquisition such friends be often with for her cheerfulness mental alacrity did not fail her while these prime supplies good remained she might have bid defiance even greater accessions worldly prosperity she might have been absolutely rich perfectly healthy yet be happy her spring felicity was glow her spirits as her friend anne s was warmth her heart anne was tenderness itself she had full worth it captain wentworth s affection his profession was all that could ever make her friends wish that tenderness less dread future war all that could dim her sunshine she gloried being sailor s wife but she must pay tax quick alarm for belonging that

himself increase fortunes his sisters by present thousand pounds piece he then really thought himself equal it prospect four thousand year addition his present income besides remaining half his own mother s fortune warmed his heart made him feel capable generosity yes he would give them three thousand pounds it would be liberal handsome it would be enough make them completely easy three thousand pounds he could spare so considerable sum with little inconvenience he thought it all day long for many days successively he did not repent no sooner was his father s funeral over than mrs john dashwood without sending any notice her intention her mother law arrived with her child their attendants no one could dispute her right come house was her husband s from moment his father s decease but indelicacy her conduct was so much greater woman mrs dashwood s situation with only common feelings must have been highly unpleasing but her mind there was sense honor so keen generosity so romantic that any offence kind by whomsoever given or received was her source immovable disgust mrs john dashwood had never been favourite with any her husband s family but she had had no opportunity till present showing them with how little attention comfort other people she could act when occasion required it so acutely did mrs dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour so earnestly did she despise her daughter law for it that on arrival latter she would have quitted house for ever had not entreaty her eldest girl induced her first reflect on propriety going her own tender love for all her three children determined her afterwards stay for their sakes avoid breach with their brother elinor this eldest daughter whose advice was so effectual possessed strength understanding coolness judgment which qualified her though only nineteen be counsellor her mother enabled her frequently counteract advantage them all that eagerness mind mrs dashwood which must generally have led imprudence she had excellent heart her disposition was affectionate her feelings were strong but she knew how govern them it was knowledge which her mother had yet learn which one her sisters had resolved never be taught marianne s abilities were many respects quite equal elinor s she was sensible clever but eager everything her sorrows her joys could have no moderation she was generous amiable interesting she was everything but prudent resemblance between her her mother was strikingly great elinor saw with concern excess her sister s sensibility but by mrs dashwood it was valued cherished they encouraged each other now violence their affliction agony grief which overpowered them at first was voluntarily renewed was sought for was created again again they gave themselves up wholly their sorrow seeking increase wretchedness every reflection that could afford it resolved against ever admitting consolation future elinor too was deeply afflicted but still she could struggle she could exert herself she could consult with her brother could receive her sister law on her arrival treat her with proper attention could strive rouse her mother similar exertion encourage her similar forbearance margaret other sister was good humored well disposed girl but as she had already imbibed good deal marianne s romance without having much her sense she did not at thirteen bid fair equal her sisters at more advanced period life chapter ii mrs john dashwood now installed herself mistress norland her mother sisters law were degraded condition visitors as such however they were treated by her with quiet civility by her husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody beyond himself his wife their child he really pressed them with some earnestness consider norland as their home as no plan appeared so eligible mrs dashwood as remaining there till she could accommodate herself with house neighbourhood his invitation was accepted continuance place where everything reminded her former delight was exactly what suited her mind seasons cheerfulness no temper could be more cheerful than hers or possess greater degree that sanguine expectation happiness which is happiness itself but sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy as far beyond consolation as pleasure she was beyond alloy mrs john dashwood did not at all approve what her husband intended do for his sisters take three thousand pounds from fortune their dear little boy would be impoverishing him most dreadful degree she begged him think again on subject how could he answer it himself rob his child his only child too so large sum what possible claim could miss dashwoods who were related him only by half blood which she considered as no relationship at all have on his generosity so large amount it was very well known that no affection was ever supposed exist between children any man by different marriages why was he ruin himself their poor little harry by giving away all his money his half sisters it was my father s last request me replied her husband that i should assist his widow daughters he did not know what he was talking i dare say ten one but he was light headed at time had he been his right senses he could not have thought such thing as begging you give away half your fortune from your own child he did not stipulate for any particular sum my dear fanny he only requested me general terms assist them make their situation more comfortable than it was his power do perhaps it would have been as well if he had left it wholly myself he could hardly suppose i should neglect them but as he required promise i could not do less than give it at least i thought so at time promise therefore was given must be performed something must be done for them whenever they leave norland settle new home well then let something be done for them but that something need not be three thousand pounds consider she added that when money is once parted with it never can return your sisters will marry it will be gone for ever if indeed it could be restored our poor little boy why be sure said her husband very gravely that would make great difference time may come when harry will regret that so large sum was parted with if he should have numerous family for instance it would be very convenient addition be sure it would perhaps then it would be better for all parties if sum were diminished one half five hundred pounds would be prodigious increase their fortunes oh beyond anything great what brother on earth would do half so much for his sisters even if really his sisters as it is only half blood but you have such generous spirit i would not wish do any thing mean he replied one had rather on such occasions do too much than too little no one at least can think i have not done enough for them even themselves they can hardly expect more there is no knowing what they may expect said lady but we are not think their expectations question is what you can afford do certainly i think i may afford give them five hundred pounds piece as it is without any addition mine they will each have about three thousand pounds on their mother s death very comfortable fortune for any young woman be sure it is indeed it strikes me that they can want no addition at all they will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them if they marry they will be sure doing well if they do not they may all live very comfortably together on interest ten thousand pounds that is very true therefore i do not know whether upon whole it would not be more advisable do something for their mother while she lives rather than for them something annuity kind i mean my sisters would feel good effects it as well as herself hundred year would make them all perfectly comfortable his wife hesitated little however giving her consent this plan be sure said she it is better than parting with fifteen hundred pounds at once but then if mrs dashwood should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken fifteen years my dear fanny her life cannot be worth half that purchase certainly not but if you observe people always live for ever when there is annuity be paid them she is very stout healthy hardly forty annuity is very serious business it comes over over every year there is no getting rid it you are not aware what you are doing i have known great deal trouble annuities for my mother was clogged with payment three old superannuated servants by my father s will it is amazing how disagreeable she found it twice every year these annuities were be paid then there was trouble getting it them then one them was said have died afterwards it turned out be no such thing my mother was quite sick it her income was not her own she said with such perpetual claims on it it was more unkind my father because otherwise money would have been entirely at my mother s disposal without any restriction whatever it has given me such abhorrence annuities that i am sure i would not pin myself down payment one for all world it is certainly unpleasant thing replied mr dashwood have those kind yearly drains on one s income one s fortune as your mother justly says is not one s own be tied down regular payment such sum on every rent day is by no means desirable it takes away one s independence undoubtedly after all you have no thanks for it they think themselves secure you do no more than what is expected it raises no gratitude at all if i were you whatever i did should be done at my own discretion entirely i would not bind myself allow them any thing yearly it may be very inconvenient some years spare hundred or even fifty pounds from our own expenses i believe you are right my love it will be better that there should be no annuity case whatever i may give them occasionally will be far greater assistance than yearly allowance because they would only enlarge their style living if they felt sure larger income would not be sixpence richer for it at end year it will certainly be much best way present fifty pounds now then will prevent their ever being distressed for money will i think be amply discharging my promise my father be sure it will indeed say truth i am convinced within myself that your father had no idea your giving them any money at all assistance he thought i dare say was only such as might be reasonably expected you for instance such as looking out for comfortable small house for them helping them move their things sending them presents fish game so forth whenever they are season i ll lay my life that he meant nothing farther indeed it would be very strange unreasonable if he did do but consider my dear mr dashwood how excessively comfortable your mother law her daughters may live on interest seven thousand pounds besides thousand pounds belonging each girls which brings them fifty pounds year piece course they will pay their mother for their board out it altogether they will have five hundred year amongst them what on earth can four women want for more than that they will live so cheap their housekeeping will be nothing at all they will have no carriage no horses hardly any servants they will keep no company can have no expenses any kind only conceive how comfortable they will be five hundred year i am sure i cannot imagine how they will spend half it as your giving them more it is quite absurd think it they will be much more able give you something upon my word said mr dashwood i believe you are perfectly right my father certainly could mean nothing more by his request me than what you say i clearly understand it now i will strictly fulfil my engagement by such acts assistance kindness them as you have described when my mother removes into another house my services shall be readily given accommodate her as far as i can some little present furniture too may be acceptable then certainly returned mrs john dashwood but however one thing must be considered when your father mother moved norland though furniture stanhill was sold all china plate linen was saved is now left your mother her house will therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it that is material consideration undoubtedly valuable legacy indeed yet some plate would have been very pleasant addition our own stock here yes set breakfast china is twice as handsome as what belongs this house great deal too handsome my opinion for any place they can ever afford live but however so it is your father thought only them i must say this that you owe no particular gratitude him nor attention his wishes for we very well know that if he could he would have left almost everything world them this argument was irresistible it gave his intentions whatever decision was wanting before he finally resolved that it would be absolutely unnecessary if not highly indecorous do more for widow children his father than such kind neighbourly acts as his own wife pointed out chapter iii mrs dashwood remained at norland several months not from any disinclination move when sight every well known spot ceased raise violent emotion which it produced for while for when her spirits began revive her mind became capable some other exertion than that heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances she was impatient be gone indefatigable her inquiries for suitable dwelling neighbourhood norland for remove far from that beloved spot was impossible but she could hear no situation that at once answered her notions comfort ease suited prudence her eldest daughter whose steadier judgment rejected several houses as too large for their income which her mother would have approved mrs dashwood had been informed by her husband solemn promise on part his son their favour which gave comfort his last earthly reflections she doubted sincerity this assurance no more than he had doubted it himself she thought it for her daughters sake with satisfaction though as for herself she was persuaded that much smaller provision than 7000 would support her affluence for their brother s sake too for sake his own heart she rejoiced she reproached herself for being unjust his merit before believing him incapable generosity his attentive behaviour herself his sisters convinced her that their welfare was dear him for long time she firmly relied on liberality his intentions contempt which she had very early their acquaintance felt for her daughter law was very much increased by farther knowledge her character which half year s residence her family afforded perhaps spite every consideration politeness or maternal affection on side former two ladies might have found it impossible have lived together so long had not particular circumstance occurred give still greater eligibility according opinions mrs dashwood her daughters continuance at norland this circumstance was growing attachment between her eldest girl brother mrs john dashwood gentleman like pleasing young man who was introduced their acquaintance soon after his sister s establishment at norland who had since spent greatest part his time there some mothers might have encouraged intimacy from motives interest for edward ferrars was eldest son man who had died very rich some might have repressed it from motives prudence for except trifling sum whole his fortune depended on will his mother but mrs dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either consideration it was enough for her that he appeared be amiable that he loved her daughter that elinor returned partiality it was contrary every doctrine hers that difference fortune should keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance disposition that elinor s merit should not be acknowledged by every one who knew her was her comprehension impossible edward ferrars was not recommended their good opinion by any peculiar graces person or address he was not handsome his manners required intimacy make them pleasing he was too diffident do justice himself but when his natural shyness was overcome his behaviour gave every indication open affectionate heart his understanding was good his education had given it solid improvement but he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition answer wishes his mother sister who longed see him distinguished as they hardly knew what they wanted him make fine figure world some manner or other his mother wished interest him political concerns get him into parliament or see him connected with some great men day mrs john dashwood wished it likewise but mean while till one these superior blessings could be attained it would have quieted her ambition see him driving barouche but edward had no turn for great men or barouches all his wishes centered domestic comfort quiet private life fortunately he had younger brother who was more promising edward had been staying several weeks house before he engaged much mrs dashwood s attention for she was at that time such affliction as rendered her careless surrounding objects she saw only that he was quiet unobtrusive she liked him for it he did not disturb wretchedness her mind by ill timed conversation she was first called observe approve him farther by reflection which elinor chanced one day make on difference between him his sister it was contrast which recommended him most forcibly her mother it is enough said she say that he is unlike fanny is enough it implies everything amiable i love him already i think you will like him said elinor when you know more him like him replied her mother with smile i feel no sentiment approbation inferior love you may esteem him i have never yet known what it was separate esteem love mrs dashwood now took pains get acquainted with him her manners were attaching soon banished his reserve she speedily comprehended all his merits persuasion his regard for elinor perhaps assisted her penetration but she really felt assured his worth even that quietness manner which militated against all her established ideas what young man s address ought be was no longer uninteresting when she knew his heart be warm his temper affectionate no sooner did she perceive any symptom love his behaviour elinor than she considered their serious attachment as certain looked forward their marriage as rapidly approaching few months my dear marianne said she elinor will all probability be settled for life we shall miss her but she will be happy oh mama how shall we do without her my love it will be scarcely separation we shall live within few miles each other shall meet every day our lives you will gain brother real affectionate brother i have highest opinion world edward s heart but you look grave marianne do you disapprove your sister s choice perhaps said marianne i may consider it with some surprise edward is very amiable i love him tenderly but yet he is not kind young man there is something wanting his figure is not striking it has none that grace which i should expect man who could seriously attach my sister his eyes want all that spirit that fire which at once announce virtue intelligence besides all this i am afraid mama he has no real taste music seems scarcely attract him though he admires elinor s drawings very much it is not admiration person who can understand their worth it is evident spite his frequent attention her while she draws that fact he knows nothing matter he admires as lover not as connoisseur satisfy me those characters must be united i could not be happy with man whose taste did not every point coincide with my own he must enter into all my feelings same books same music must charm us both oh mama how spiritless how tame was edward s manner reading us last night i felt for my sister most severely yet she bore it with so much composure she seemed scarcely notice it i could hardly keep my seat hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild pronounced with such impenetrable calmness such dreadful indifference he would certainly have done more justice simple elegant prose i thought so at time but you would give him cowper nay mama if he is not be animated by cowper but we must allow for difference taste elinor has not my feelings therefore she may overlook it be happy with him but it would have broke my heart had i loved him hear him read with so little sensibility mama more i know world more am i convinced that i shall never see man whom i can really love i require so much he must have all edward s virtues his person manners must ornament his goodness with every possible charm remember my love that you are not seventeen it is yet too early life despair such happiness why should you be less fortunate than your mother one circumstance only my marianne may your destiny be different from hers chapter iv what pity it is elinor said marianne that edward should have no taste for drawing no taste for drawing replied elinor why should you think so he does not draw himself indeed but he has great pleasure seeing performances other people i assure you he is by no means deficient natural taste though he has not had opportunities improving it had he ever been way learning i think he would have drawn very well he distrusts his own judgment such matters so much that he is always unwilling give his opinion on any picture but he has innate propriety simplicity taste which general direct him perfectly right marianne was afraid offending said no more on subject but kind approbation which elinor described as excited him by drawings other people was very far from that rapturous delight which her opinion could alone be called taste yet though smiling within herself at mistake she honoured her sister for that blind partiality edward which produced it i hope marianne continued elinor you do not consider him as deficient general taste indeed i think i may say that you cannot for your behaviour him is perfectly cordial if that were your opinion i am sure you could never be civil him marianne hardly knew what say she would not wound feelings her sister on any account yet say what she did not believe was impossible at length she replied do not be offended elinor if my praise him is not every thing equal your sense his merits i have not had so many opportunities estimating minuter propensities his mind his inclinations tastes as you have but i have highest opinion world his goodness sense i think him every thing that is worthy amiable i am sure replied elinor with smile that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that i do not perceive how you could express yourself more warmly marianne was rejoiced find her sister so easily pleased his sense his goodness continued elinor no one can i think be doubt who has seen him often enough engage him unreserved conversation excellence his understanding his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent you know enough him do justice his solid worth but his minuter propensities as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself he i have been at times thrown good deal together while you have been wholly engrossed on most affectionate principle by my mother i have seen great deal him have studied his sentiments heard his opinion on subjects literature taste upon whole i venture pronounce that his mind is well informed enjoyment books exceedingly great his imagination lively his observation just correct his taste delicate pure his abilities every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners person at first sight his address is certainly not striking his person can hardly be called handsome till expression his eyes which are uncommonly good general sweetness his countenance is perceived at present i know him so well that i think him really handsome or at least almost so what say you marianne i shall very soon think him handsome elinor if i do not now when you tell me love him as brother i shall no more see imperfection his face than i now do his heart elinor started at this declaration was sorry for warmth she had been betrayed into speaking him she felt that edward stood very high her opinion she believed regard be mutual but she required greater certainty it make marianne s conviction their attachment agreeable her she knew that what marianne her mother conjectured one moment they believed next that with them wish was hope hope was expect she tried explain real state case her sister i do not attempt deny said she that i think very highly him that i greatly esteem that i like him marianne here burst forth with indignation esteem him like him cold hearted elinor oh worse than cold hearted ashamed being otherwise use those words again i will leave room this moment elinor could not help laughing excuse me said she be assured that i meant no offence you by speaking so quiet way my own feelings believe them be stronger than i have declared believe them short be such as his merit suspicion hope his affection for me may warrant without imprudence or folly but farther than this you must not believe i am by no means assured his regard for me there are moments when extent it seems doubtful till his sentiments are fully known you cannot wonder at my wishing avoid any encouragement my own partiality by believing or calling it more than it is my heart i feel little scarcely any doubt his preference but there are other points be considered besides his inclination he is very far from being independent what his mother really is we cannot know but from fanny s occasional mention her conduct opinions we have never been disposed think her amiable i am very much mistaken if edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties his way if he were wish marry woman who had not either great fortune or high rank marianne was astonished find how much imagination her mother herself had outstripped truth you really are not engaged him said she yet it certainly soon will happen but two advantages will proceed from this delay i shall not lose you so soon edward will have greater opportunity improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be so indispensably necessary your future felicity oh if he should be so far stimulated by your genius as learn draw himself how delightful it would be elinor had given her real opinion her sister she could not consider her partiality for edward so prosperous state as marianne had believed it there was at times want spirits about him which if it did not denote indifference spoke something almost as unpromising doubt her regard supposing him feel it need not give him more than inquietude it would not be likely produce that dejection mind which frequently attended him more reasonable cause might be found dependent situation which forbade indulgence his affection she knew that his mother neither behaved him so as make his home comfortable at present nor give him any assurance that he might form home for himself without strictly attending her views for his aggrandizement with such knowledge as this it was impossible for elinor feel easy on subject she was far from depending on that result his preference her which her mother sister still considered as certain nay longer they were together more doubtful seemed nature his regard sometimes for few painful minutes she believed it be no more than friendship but whatever might really be its limits it was enough when perceived by his sister make her uneasy at same time which was still more common make her uncivil she took first opportunity affronting her mother law on occasion talking her so expressively her brother s great expectations mrs ferrars s resolution that both her sons should marry well danger attending any young woman who attempted draw him that mrs dashwood could neither pretend be unconscious nor endeavor be calm she gave her answer which marked her contempt instantly left room resolving that whatever might be inconvenience or expense so sudden removal her beloved elinor should not be exposed another week such insinuations this state her spirits letter was delivered her from post which contained proposal particularly well timed it was offer small house on very easy terms belonging relation her own gentleman consequence property devonshire letter was from this gentleman himself written true spirit friendly accommodation he understood that she was need dwelling though house he now offered her was merely cottage he assured her that everything should be done it which she might think necessary if situation pleased her he earnestly pressed her after giving particulars house garden come with her daughters barton park place his own residence from whence she might judge herself whether barton cottage for houses were same parish could by any alteration be made comfortable her he seemed really anxious accommodate them whole his letter was written so friendly style as could not fail giving pleasure his cousin more especially at moment when she was suffering under cold unfeeling behaviour her nearer connections she needed no time for deliberation or inquiry her resolution was formed as she read situation barton county so far distant from sussex as devonshire which but few hours before would have been sufficient objection outweigh every possible advantage belonging place was now its first recommendation quit neighbourhood norland was no longer evil it was object desire it was blessing comparison misery continuing her daughter law s guest remove for ever from that beloved place would be less painful than inhabit or visit it while such woman was its mistress she instantly wrote sir john middleton her acknowledgment his kindness her acceptance his proposal then hastened show both letters her daughters that she might be secure their approbation before her answer were sent elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them settle at some distance from norland than immediately amongst their present acquaintance on that head therefore it was not for her oppose her mother s intention removing into devonshire house too as described by sir john was on so simple scale rent so uncommonly moderate as leave her no right objection on either point therefore though it was not plan which brought any charm her fancy though it was removal from vicinity norland beyond her wishes she made no attempt dissuade her mother from sending letter acquiescence chapter v no sooner was her answer dispatched than mrs dashwood indulged herself pleasure announcing her son law his wife that she was provided with house should incommode them no longer than till every thing were ready for her inhabiting it they heard her with surprise mrs john dashwood said nothing but her husband civilly hoped that she would not be settled far from norland she had great satisfaction replying that she was going into devonshire edward turned hastily towards her on hearing this voice surprise concern which required no explanation her repeated devonshire are you indeed going there so far from hence what part it she explained situation it was within four miles northward exeter it is but cottage she continued but i hope see many my friends it room or two can easily be added if my friends find no difficulty travelling so far see me i am sure i will find none accommodating them she concluded with very kind invitation mr mrs john dashwood visit her at barton edward she gave one with still greater affection though her late conversation with her daughter law had made her resolve on remaining at norland no longer than was unavoidable it had not produced smallest effect on her that point which it principally tended separate edward elinor was as far from being her object as ever she wished show mrs john dashwood by this pointed invitation her brother how totally she disregarded her disapprobation match mr john dashwood told his mother again again how exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken house at such distance from norland as prevent his being any service her removing her furniture he really felt conscientiously vexed on occasion for very exertion which he had limited performance his promise his father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable furniture was all sent around by water it chiefly consisted household linen plate china books with handsome pianoforte marianne s mrs john dashwood saw packages depart with sigh she could not help feeling it hard that as mrs dashwood s income would be so trifling comparison with their own she should have any handsome article furniture mrs dashwood took house for twelvemonth it was ready furnished she might have immediate possession no difficulty arose on either side agreement she waited only for disposal her effects at norland determine her future household before she set off for west this as she was exceedingly rapid performance everything that interested her was soon done horses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after his death opportunity now offering disposing her carriage she agreed sell that likewise at earnest advice her eldest daughter for comfort her children had she consulted only her own wishes she would have kept it but discretion elinor prevailed her wisdom too limited number their servants three two maids man with whom they were speedily provided from amongst those who had formed their establishment at norland man one maids were sent off immediately into devonshire prepare house for their mistress s arrival for as lady middleton was entirely unknown mrs dashwood she preferred going directly cottage being visitor at barton park she relied so undoubtingly on sir john s description house as feel no curiosity examine it herself till she entered it as her own her eagerness be gone from norland was preserved from diminution by evident satisfaction her daughter law prospect her removal satisfaction which was but feebly attempted be concealed under cold invitation her defer her departure now was time when her son law s promise his father might with particular propriety be fulfilled since he had neglected do it on first coming estate their quitting his house might be looked on as most suitable period for its accomplishment but mrs dashwood began shortly give over every hope kind be convinced from general drift his discourse that his assistance extended no farther than their maintenance for six months at norland he so frequently talked increasing expenses housekeeping perpetual demands upon his purse which man any consequence world was beyond calculation exposed that he seemed rather stand need more money himself than have any design giving money away very few weeks from day which brought sir john middleton s first letter norland every thing was so far settled their future abode as enable mrs dashwood her daughters begin their journey many were tears shed by them their last adieus place so much beloved dear dear norland said marianne as she wandered alone before house on last evening their being there when shall i cease regret you when learn feel home elsewhere oh happy house could you know what i suffer now viewing you from this spot from whence perhaps i may view you no more you ye well known trees but you will continue same no leaf will decay because we are removed nor any branch become motionless although we can observe you no longer no you will continue same unconscious pleasure or regret you occasion insensible any change those who walk under your shade but who will remain enjoy you chapter vi first part their journey was performed too melancholy disposition be otherwise than tedious unpleasant but as they drew towards end it their interest appearance country which they were inhabit overcame their dejection view barton valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness it was pleasant fertile spot well wooded rich pasture after winding along it for more than mile they reached their own house small green court was whole its demesne front neat wicket gate admitted them into it as house barton cottage though small was comfortable compact but as cottage it was defective for building was regular roof was tiled window shutters were not painted green nor were walls covered with honeysuckles narrow passage led directly through house into garden behind on each side entrance was sitting room about sixteen feet square beyond them were offices stairs four bed rooms two garrets formed rest house it had not been built many years was good repair comparison norland it was poor small indeed but tears which recollection called forth as they entered house were soon dried away they were cheered by joy servants on their arrival each for sake others resolved appear happy it was very early september season was fine from first seeing place under advantage good weather they received impression its favour which was material service recommending it their lasting approbation situation house was good high hills rose immediately behind at no great distance on each side some which were open downs others cultivated woody village barton was chiefly on one these hills formed pleasant view from cottage windows prospect front was more extensive it commanded whole valley reached into country beyond hills which surrounded cottage terminated valley that direction under another name another course it branched out again between two steepest them with size furniture house mrs dashwood was upon whole well satisfied for though her former style life rendered many additions latter indispensable yet add improve was delight her she had at this time ready money enough supply all that was wanted greater elegance apartments as for house itself be sure said she it is too small for our family but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for present as it is too late year for improvements perhaps spring if i have plenty money as i dare say i shall we may think about building these parlors are both too small for such parties our friends as i hope see often collected here i have some thoughts throwing passage into one them with perhaps part other so leave remainder that other for entrance this with new drawing room which may be easily added bed chamber garret above will make it very snug little cottage i could wish stairs were handsome but one must not expect every thing though i suppose it would be no difficult matter widen them i shall see how much i am before hand with world spring we will plan our improvements accordingly mean time till all these alterations could be made from savings income five hundred year by woman who never saved her life they were wise enough be contented with house as it was each them was busy arranging their particular concerns endeavoring by placing around them books other possessions form themselves home marianne s pianoforte was unpacked properly disposed elinor s drawings were affixed walls their

followed before end day by present game he insisted moreover on conveying all their letters from post for them would not be denied satisfaction sending them his newspaper every day lady middleton had

wishes lady middleton was not more than six or seven twenty her face was handsome her figure tall striking her address graceful her manners had all elegance which her husband s wanted but they would have been improved by some share his frankness warmth her visit was long enough detract something from their first admiration by showing that though perfectly well bred she was reserved cold had

formal visit child ought be party by way provision for discourse present case it took up ten minutes determine whether boy were most like his father or mother what particular he resembled either for course every body differed every body was astonished at opinion others opportunity was soon be given dashwoods debating on rest children as sir john would not leave house without securing their promise dining at park next day chapter vii barton park was about half mile from cottage ladies had passed near it their way along valley but it was screened from their view at home by projection hill

charmed with inhabitants he had now procured for his cottage at barton miss dashwoods were young pretty unaffected it was enough secure his good opinion for be unaffected was all that pretty girl could want make her mind as captivating as her person friendliness his disposition made him happy accommodating those whose situation might be considered comparison with past as unfortunate showing kindness his cousins therefore he had real satisfaction good heart settling family females only his cottage he had all satisfaction sportsman for sportsman though he esteems only those his sex who are sportsmen likewise is not often desirous encouraging their taste by admitting them residence within his own manor mrs dashwood her daughters were met at door house by sir john who welcomed them barton park with unaffected sincerity as he attended them drawing room repeated young ladies concern which same subject had drawn from him day before at being unable get any smart young men meet them they would see he said only one gentleman there besides himself particular friend who was staying at park but who was neither very young nor very gay he hoped they would all excuse smallness party could assure them it should never happen so again he had been several families that morning hopes procuring some addition their number but it was moonlight every body was full engagements luckily lady middleton s mother had arrived at barton within last hour as she was very cheerful agreeable woman he hoped young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might imagine young ladies as well as their mother were perfectly satisfied with having two entire strangers party wished for no more mrs jennings lady middleton s mother was good humoured merry fat elderly woman who talked great deal seemed very happy rather vulgar she was full jokes laughter before dinner was over had said many witty things on subject lovers husbands hoped they had not left their hearts behind them sussex pretended see them blush whether they did or not marianne was vexed at it for her sister s sake turned her eyes towards elinor see how she bore these attacks with earnestness which gave elinor far more pain than could arise from such common place raillery as mrs jennings s colonel brandon friend sir john seemed no more adapted by resemblance manner be his friend than lady middleton was be his wife or mrs jennings be lady middleton s mother he was silent grave his appearance however was not unpleasing spite his being opinion marianne margaret absolute old bachelor for he was on wrong side five thirty but though his face was not handsome his countenance was sensible his address was particularly gentlemanlike there was nothing any party which could recommend them as companions dashwoods but cold insipidity lady middleton was so particularly repulsive that comparison it gravity colonel brandon even boisterous mirth sir john his mother law was interesting lady middleton seemed be roused enjoyment only by entrance her four noisy children after dinner who pulled her about tore her clothes put end every kind discourse except what related themselves evening as marianne was discovered be musical she was invited play instrument was unlocked every body prepared be charmed marianne who sang very well at their request went through chief songs which lady middleton had brought into family on her marriage which perhaps had lain ever since same position on pianoforte for her ladyship had celebrated that event by giving up music although by her mother s account she had played extremely well by her own was very fond it marianne s performance was highly applauded sir john was loud his admiration at end every song as loud his conversation with others while every song lasted lady middleton frequently called him order wondered how any one s attention could be diverted from music for moment asked marianne sing particular song which marianne had just finished colonel brandon alone all party heard her without being raptures he paid her only compliment attention she felt respect for him on occasion which others had reasonably forfeited by their shameless want taste his pleasure music though it amounted not that ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own was estimable when contrasted against horrible insensibility others she was reasonable enough allow that man five thirty might well have outlived all acuteness feeling every exquisite power enjoyment she was perfectly disposed make every allowance for colonel s advanced state life which humanity required chapter viii mrs jennings was widow with ample jointure she had only two daughters both whom she had lived see respectably married she had now therefore nothing do but marry all rest world promotion this object she was zealously active as far as her ability reached missed no opportunity projecting weddings among all young people her acquaintance she was remarkably quick discovery attachments had enjoyed advantage raising blushes vanity many young lady by insinuations her power over such young man this kind discernment enabled her soon after her arrival at barton decisively pronounce that colonel brandon was very much love with marianne dashwood she rather suspected it be so on very first evening their being together from his listening so attentively while she sang them when visit was returned by middletons dining at cottage fact was ascertained by his listening her again it must be so she was perfectly convinced it it would be excellent match for he was rich she was handsome mrs jennings had been anxious see colonel brandon well married ever since her connection with sir john first brought him her knowledge she was always anxious get good husband for every pretty girl immediate advantage herself was by no means inconsiderable for it supplied her with endless jokes against them both at park she laughed at colonel cottage at marianne former her raillery was probably as far as it regarded only himself perfectly indifferent but latter it was at first incomprehensible when its object was understood she hardly knew whether most laugh at its absurdity or censure its impertinence for she considered it as unfeeling reflection on colonel s advanced years on his forlorn condition as old bachelor mrs dashwood who could not think man five years younger than herself so exceedingly ancient as he appeared youthful fancy her daughter ventured clear mrs jennings from probability wishing throw ridicule on his age but at least mama you cannot deny absurdity accusation though you may not think it intentionally ill natured colonel brandon is certainly younger than mrs jennings but he is old enough be my father if he were ever animated enough be love must have long outlived every sensation kind it is too ridiculous when is man be safe from such wit if age infirmity will not protect him infirmity said elinor do you call colonel brandon infirm i can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater you than my mother but you can hardly deceive yourself as his having use his limbs did not you hear him complain rheumatism is not that commonest infirmity declining life my dearest child said her mother laughing at this rate you must be continual terror my decay it must seem you miracle that my life has been extended advanced age forty mama you are not doing me justice i know very well that colonel brandon is not old enough make his friends yet apprehensive losing him course nature he may live twenty years longer but thirty five has nothing do with matrimony perhaps said elinor thirty five seventeen had better not have any thing do with matrimony together but if there should by any chance happen be woman who is single at seven twenty i should not think colonel brandon s being thirty five any objection his marrying her woman seven twenty said marianne after pausing moment can never hope feel or inspire affection again if her home be uncomfortable or her fortune small i can suppose that she might bring herself submit offices nurse for sake provision security wife his marrying such woman therefore there would be nothing unsuitable it would be compact convenience world would be satisfied my eyes it would be no marriage at all but that would be nothing me it would seem only commercial exchange which each wished be benefited at expense other it would be impossible i know replied elinor convince you that woman seven twenty could feel for man thirty five anything near enough love make him desirable companion her but i must object your dooming colonel brandon his wife constant confinement sick chamber merely because he chanced complain yesterday very cold damp day slight rheumatic feel one his shoulders but he talked flannel waistcoats said marianne with me flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches cramps rheumatisms every species ailment that can afflict old feeble had he been only violent fever you would not have despised him half so much confess marianne is not there something interesting you flushed cheek hollow eye quick pulse fever soon after this upon elinor s leaving room mama said marianne i have alarm on subject illness which i cannot conceal from you i am sure edward ferrars is not well we have now been here almost fortnight yet he does not come nothing but real indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay what else can detain him at norland had you any idea his coming so soon said mrs dashwood i had none on contrary if i have felt any anxiety at all on subject it has been recollecting that he sometimes showed want pleasure readiness accepting my invitation when i talked his coming barton does elinor expect him already i have never mentioned it her but course she must i rather think you are mistaken for when i was talking her yesterday getting new grate for spare bedchamber she observed that there was no immediate hurry for it as it was not likely that room would be wanted for some time how strange this is what can be meaning it but whole their behaviour each other has been unaccountable how cold how composed were their last adieus how languid their conversation last evening their being together edward s farewell there was no distinction between elinor me it was good wishes affectionate brother both twice did i leave them purposely together course last morning each time did he most unaccountably follow me out room elinor quitting norland edward cried not as i did even now her self command is invariable when is she dejected or melancholy when does she try avoid society or appear restless dissatisfied it chapter ix dashwoods were now settled at barton with tolerable comfort themselves house garden with all objects surrounding them were now become familiar ordinary pursuits which had given norland half its charms were engaged again with far greater enjoyment than norland had been able afford since loss their father sir john middleton who called on them every day for first fortnight who was not habit seeing much occupation at home could not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed their visitors except those from barton park were not many for spite sir john s urgent entreaties that they would mix more neighbourhood repeated assurances his carriage being always at their service independence mrs dashwood s spirit overcame wish society for her children she was resolute declining visit any family beyond distance walk there were but few who could be so classed it was not all them that were attainable about mile half from cottage along narrow winding valley allenham which issued from that barton as formerly described girls had one their earliest walks discovered ancient respectable looking mansion which by reminding them little norland interested their imagination made them wish be better acquainted with it but they learnt on enquiry that its possessor elderly lady very good character was unfortunately too infirm mix with world never stirred from home whole country about them abounded beautiful walks high downs which invited them from almost every window cottage seek exquisite enjoyment air on their summits were happy alternative when dirt valleys beneath shut up their superior beauties towards one these hills did marianne margaret one memorable morning direct their steps attracted by partial sunshine showery sky unable longer bear confinement which settled rain two preceding days had occasioned weather was not tempting enough draw two others from their pencil their book spite marianne s declaration that day would be lastingly fair that every threatening cloud would be drawn off from their hills two girls set off together they gaily ascended downs rejoicing their own penetration at every glimpse blue sky when they caught their faces animating gales high south westerly wind they pitied fears which had prevented their mother elinor from sharing such delightful sensations is there felicity world said marianne superior this margaret we will walk here at least two hours margaret agreed they pursued their way against wind resisting it with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer when suddenly clouds united over their heads driving rain set full their face chagrined surprised they were obliged though unwillingly turn back for no shelter was nearer than their own house one consolation however remained for them which exigence moment gave more than usual propriety it was that running with all possible speed down steep side hill which led immediately their garden gate they set off marianne had at first advantage but false step brought her suddenly ground margaret unable stop herself assist her was involuntarily hurried along reached bottom safety gentleman carrying gun with two pointers playing round him was passing up hill within few yards marianne when her accident happened he put down his gun ran her assistance she had raised herself from ground but her foot had been twisted her fall she was scarcely able stand gentleman offered his services perceiving that her modesty declined what her situation rendered necessary took her up his arms without farther delay carried her down hill then passing through garden gate which had been left open by margaret he bore her directly into house whither margaret was just arrived quitted not his hold till he had seated her chair parlour elinor her mother rose up amazement at their entrance while eyes both were fixed on him with evident wonder secret admiration which equally sprung from his appearance he apologized for his intrusion by relating its cause manner so frank so graceful that his person which was uncommonly handsome received additional charms from his voice expression had he been even old ugly vulgar gratitude kindness mrs dashwood would have been secured by any act attention her child but influence youth beauty elegance gave interest action which came home her feelings she thanked him again again with sweetness address which always attended her invited him be seated but this he declined as he was dirty wet mrs dashwood then begged know whom she was obliged his name he replied was willoughby his present home was at allenham from whence he hoped she would allow him honour calling tomorrow enquire after miss dashwood honour was readily granted he then departed make himself still more interesting midst heavy rain his manly beauty more than common gracefulness were instantly theme general admiration laugh which his gallantry raised against marianne received particular spirit from his exterior attractions marianne herself had seen less his person than rest for confusion which crimsoned over her face on his lifting her up had robbed her power regarding him after their entering house but she had seen enough him join all admiration others with energy which always adorned her praise his person air were equal what her fancy had ever drawn for hero favourite story his carrying her into house with so little previous formality there was rapidity thought which particularly recommended action her every circumstance belonging him was interesting his name was good his residence was their favourite village she soon found out that all manly dresses shooting jacket was most becoming her imagination was busy her reflections were pleasant pain sprained ankle was disregarded sir john called on them as soon as next interval fair weather that morning allowed him get out doors marianne s accident being related him he was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman name willoughby at allenham willoughby cried sir john what is he country that is good news however i will ride over tomorrow ask him dinner on thursday you know him then said mrs dashwood know him be sure i do why he is down here every year what sort young man is he as good kind fellow as ever lived i assure you very decent shot there is not bolder rider england is that all you can say for him cried marianne indignantly but what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance what his pursuits his talents genius sir john was rather puzzled upon my soul said he i do not know much about him as all that but he is pleasant good humoured fellow has got nicest little black bitch pointer i ever saw was she out with him today but marianne could no more satisfy him as colour mr willoughby s pointer than he could describe her shades his mind but who is he said elinor where does he come from has he house at allenham on this point sir john could give more certain intelligence he told them that mr willoughby had no property his own country that he resided there only while he was visiting old lady at allenham court whom he was related whose possessions he was inherit adding yes yes he is very well worth catching i can tell you miss dashwood he has pretty little estate his own somersetshire besides if i were you i would not give him up my younger sister spite all this tumbling down hills miss marianne must not expect have all men herself brandon will be jealous if she does not take care i do not believe said mrs dashwood with good humoured smile that mr willoughby will be incommoded by attempts either my daughters towards what you call catching him it is not employment which they have been brought up men are very safe with us let them be ever so rich i am glad find however from what you say that he is respectable young man one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible he is as good sort fellow i believe as ever lived repeated sir john i remember last christmas at little hop at park he danced from eight o clock till four without once sitting down did he indeed cried marianne with sparkling eyes with elegance with spirit yes he was up again at eight ride covert that is what i like that is what young man ought be whatever be his pursuits his eagerness them should know no moderation leave him no sense fatigue aye aye i see how it will be said sir john i see how it will be you will be setting your cap at him now never think poor brandon that is expression sir john said marianne warmly which i particularly dislike i abhor every common place phrase by which wit is intended setting one s cap at man or making conquest are most odious all their tendency is gross illiberal if their construction could ever be deemed clever time has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity sir john did not much understand this reproof but he laughed as heartily as if he did then replied ay you will make conquests enough i dare say one way or other poor brandon he is quite smitten already he is very well worth setting your cap at i can tell you spite all this tumbling about spraining ankles chapter x marianne s preserver as margaret with more elegance than precision styled willoughby called at cottage early next morning make his personal enquiries he was received by mrs dashwood with more than politeness with kindness which sir john s account him her own gratitude prompted every thing that passed during visit tended assure him sense elegance mutual affection domestic comfort family whom accident had now introduced him their personal charms he had not required second interview be convinced miss dashwood had delicate complexion regular features remarkably pretty figure marianne was still handsomer her form though not so correct as her sister s having advantage height was more striking her face was so lovely that when common cant praise she was called beautiful girl truth was less violently outraged than usually happens her skin was very brown but from its transparency her complexion was uncommonly brilliant her features were all good her smile was sweet attractive her eyes which were very dark there was life spirit eagerness which could hardly be seen without delight from willoughby their expression was at first held back by embarrassment which remembrance his assistance created but when this passed away when her spirits became collected when she saw that perfect good breeding gentleman he united frankness vivacity above all when she heard him declare that music dancing he was passionately fond she gave him such look approbation as secured largest share his discourse herself for rest his stay it was only necessary mention any favourite amusement engage her talk she could not be silent when such points were introduced she had neither shyness nor reserve their discussion they speedily discovered that their enjoyment dancing music was mutual that it arose from general conformity judgment all that related either encouraged by this further examination his opinions she proceeded question him on subject books her favourite authors were brought forward dwelt upon with so rapturous delight that any young man five twenty must have been insensible indeed not become immediate convert excellence such works however disregarded before their taste was strikingly alike same books same passages were idolized by each or if any difference appeared any objection arose it lasted no longer than till force her arguments brightness her eyes could be displayed he acquiesced all her decisions caught all her enthusiasm long before his visit concluded they conversed with familiarity long established acquaintance well marianne said elinor as soon as he had left them for one morning i think you have done pretty well you have already ascertained mr willoughby s opinion almost every matter importance you know what he thinks cowper scott you are certain his estimating their beauties as he ought you have received every assurance his admiring pope no more than is proper but how is your acquaintance be long supported under such extraordinary despatch every subject for discourse you will soon have exhausted each favourite topic another meeting will suffice explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty second marriages then you can have nothing farther ask elinor cried marianne is this fair is this just are my ideas so scanty but i see what you mean i have been too much at my ease too happy too frank i have erred against every common place notion decorum i have been open sincere where i ought have been reserved spiritless dull deceitful had i talked only weather roads had i spoken only once ten minutes this reproach would have been spared my love said her mother you must not be offended with elinor she was only jest i should scold her myself if she were capable wishing check delight your conversation with our new friend marianne was softened moment willoughby on his side gave every proof his pleasure their acquaintance which evident wish improving it could offer he came them every day enquire after marianne was at first his excuse but encouragement his reception which every day gave greater kindness made such excuse unnecessary before it had ceased be possible by marianne s perfect recovery she was confined for some days house but never had any confinement been less irksome willoughby was young man good abilities quick imagination lively spirits open affectionate manners he was exactly formed engage marianne s heart for with all this he joined not only captivating person but natural ardour mind which was now roused increased by example her own which recommended him her affection beyond every thing else his society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment they read they talked they sang together his musical talents were considerable he read with all sensibility spirit which edward had unfortunately wanted mrs dashwood s estimation he was as faultless as marianne s elinor saw nothing censure him but propensity which he strongly resembled peculiarly delighted her sister saying too much what he thought on every occasion without attention persons or circumstances hastily forming giving his opinion other people sacrificing general politeness enjoyment undivided attention where his heart was engaged slighting too easily forms worldly propriety he displayed want caution which elinor could not approve spite all that he marianne could say its support marianne began now perceive that desperation which had seized her at sixteen half ever seeing man who could satisfy her ideas perfection had been rash unjustifiable willoughby was all that her fancy had delineated that unhappy hour every brighter period as capable attaching her his behaviour declared his wishes be that respect as earnest as his abilities were strong her mother too whose mind not one speculative thought their marriage had been raised by his prospect riches was led before end week hope expect it secretly congratulate herself on having gained two such sons law as edward willoughby colonel brandon s partiality for marianne which had so early been discovered by his friends now first became perceptible elinor when it ceased be noticed by them their attention wit were drawn off his more fortunate rival raillery which other had incurred before any partiality arose was removed when his feelings began really call for ridicule so justly annexed sensibility elinor was obliged though unwillingly believe that sentiments which mrs jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction were now actually excited by her sister that however general resemblance disposition between parties might forward affection mr willoughby equally striking opposition character was no hindrance regard colonel brandon she saw it with concern for what could silent man five thirty hope when opposed very lively one five twenty as she could not even wish him successful she heartily wished him indifferent she liked him spite his gravity reserve she beheld him object interest his manners though serious were mild his reserve appeared rather result some oppression spirits than any natural gloominess temper sir john had dropped hints past injuries disappointments which justified her belief his being unfortunate man she regarded him with respect compassion perhaps she pitied esteemed him more because he was slighted by willoughby marianne who prejudiced against him for being neither lively nor young seemed resolved undervalue his merits brandon is just kind man said willoughby one day when they were talking him together whom every body speaks well nobody cares about whom all are delighted see nobody remembers talk that is exactly what i think him cried marianne do not boast it however said elinor for it is injustice both you he is highly esteemed by all family at park i never see him myself without taking pains converse with him that he is patronised by you replied willoughby is certainly his favour but as for esteem others it is reproach itself who would submit indignity being approved by such woman as lady middleton mrs jennings that could command indifference any body else but perhaps abuse such people as yourself marianne will make amends for regard lady middleton her mother if their praise is censure your censure may be praise for they are not more undiscerning than you are prejudiced unjust defence your prot g you can even be saucy my prot g as you call him is sensible man sense will always have attractions for me yes marianne even man between thirty forty he has seen great deal world has been abroad has read has thinking mind i have found him capable giving me much information on various subjects he has always answered my inquiries with readiness good breeding good nature that is say cried marianne contemptuously he has told you that east indies climate is hot mosquitoes are troublesome he would have told me so i doubt not had i made any such inquiries but they happened be points on which i had been previously informed perhaps said willoughby his observations may have extended existence nabobs gold mohrs palanquins i may venture say that his observations have stretched much further than your candour but why should you dislike him i do not dislike him i consider him on contrary as very respectable man who has every body s good word nobody s notice who has more money than he can spend more time than he knows how employ two new coats every year add which cried marianne that he has neither genius taste nor spirit that his understanding has no brilliancy his feelings no ardour his voice no expression you decide on his imperfections so much mass replied elinor so much on strength your own imagination that commendation i am able give him is comparatively cold insipid i can only pronounce him be sensible man well bred well informed gentle address i believe possessing amiable heart miss dashwood cried willoughby you are now using me unkindly you are endeavouring disarm me by reason convince me against my will but it will not do you shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful i have three unanswerable reasons for disliking colonel brandon he threatened me with rain when i wanted it be fine he has found fault with hanging my curricle i cannot persuade him buy my brown mare if it will be any satisfaction you however be told that i believe his character be other respects irreproachable i am ready confess it return for acknowledgment which must give me some pain you cannot deny me privilege disliking him as much as ever chapter xi little had mrs dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first came into devonshire that so many engagements would arise occupy their time as shortly presented themselves or that they should have such frequent invitations such constant visitors as leave them little leisure for serious employment yet such was case when marianne was recovered schemes amusement at home abroad which sir john had been previously forming were put into execution private balls at park then began parties on water were made accomplished as often as showery october would allow every meeting kind willoughby was included ease familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly calculated give increasing intimacy his acquaintance with dashwoods afford him opportunity witnessing excellencies marianne marking his animated admiration her receiving her behaviour himself most pointed assurance her affection elinor could not be surprised at their attachment she only wished that it were less openly shown once or twice did venture suggest propriety some self command marianne but marianne abhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve aim at restraint sentiments which were not themselves illaudable appeared her not merely unnecessary effort but disgraceful subjection reason common place mistaken notions willoughby thought same their behaviour at all times was illustration their opinions when he was present she had no eyes for any one else every thing he did was right every thing he said was clever if their evenings at park were concluded with cards he cheated himself all rest party get her good hand if dancing formed amusement night they were partners for half time when obliged separate for couple dances were careful stand together scarcely spoke word any body else such conduct made them course most exceedingly laughed at but ridicule could not shame seemed hardly provoke them mrs dashwood entered into all their feelings with warmth which left her no inclination for checking this excessive display them her it was but natural consequence strong affection young ardent mind this was season happiness marianne her heart was devoted willoughby fond attachment norland which she brought with her from sussex was more likely be softened than she had thought it possible before by charms which his society bestowed on her present home elinor s happiness was not so great her heart was not so much at ease nor her satisfaction their amusements so pure they afforded her no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind nor that could teach her think norland with less regret than ever neither lady middleton nor mrs jennings could supply her conversation she missed although latter was everlasting talker from first had regarded her with kindness which ensured her large share her discourse she had already repeated her own history elinor three or four times had elinor s memory been equal her means improvement she might have known very early their acquaintance all particulars mr jennings s last illness what he said his wife few minutes before he died lady middleton was more agreeable than her mother only being more silent elinor needed little observation perceive that her reserve was mere calmness manner with which sense had nothing do towards her husband mother she was same as them intimacy was therefore neither be looked for nor desired she had nothing say one day that she had not said day before her insipidity was invariable for even her spirits were always same though she did not oppose parties arranged by her husband provided every thing were conducted style her two eldest children attended her she never appeared receive more enjoyment from them than she might have experienced sitting at home so little did her presence add pleasure others by any share their conversation that they were sometimes only reminded her being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys colonel brandon alone all her new acquaintance did elinor find person who could any degree claim respect abilities excite interest friendship or give pleasure as companion willoughby was out question her admiration regard even her sisterly regard was all his own but he was lover his attentions were wholly marianne s far less agreeable man might have been more generally pleasing colonel brandon unfortunately for himself had no such encouragement think only marianne conversing with elinor he found greatest consolation for indifference her sister elinor s compassion for him increased as she had reason suspect that misery disappointed love had already been known him this suspicion was given by some words which accidentally dropped from him one evening at park when they were sitting down together by mutual consent while others were dancing his eyes were fixed on marianne after silence some minutes he said with faint smile your sister i understand does not approve second attachments no replied elinor her opinions are all romantic or rather as i believe she considers them impossible exist i believe she does but how she contrives it without reflecting on character her own father who had himself two wives i know not few years however will settle her opinions on reasonable basis common sense observation then they may be more easy define justify than they now are by any body but herself this will probably be case he replied yet there is something so amiable prejudices young mind that one is sorry see them give way reception more general opinions i cannot agree with you there said elinor there are inconveniences attending such feelings as marianne s which all charms enthusiasm ignorance world cannot atone for her systems have all unfortunate tendency setting propriety at nought better acquaintance with world is what i look forward as her greatest possible advantage after short pause he resumed conversation by saying does your sister make no distinction her objections against second attachment or is it equally criminal every body are those who have been disappointed their first choice whether from inconstancy its object or perverseness circumstances be equally indifferent during rest their lives upon my word i am not acquainted with minutiae her principles i only know that i never yet heard her admit any instance second attachment s being pardonable this said he cannot hold but change total change sentiments no no do not desire it for when romantic refinements young mind are obliged give way how frequently are they succeeded by such opinions as are but too common too dangerous i speak from experience i once knew lady who temper mind greatly resembled your sister who thought judged like her but who from enforced change from series unfortunate circumstances here he stopt suddenly appeared think that he had said too much by his countenance gave rise conjectures which might not otherwise have entered elinor s head lady would probably have passed without suspicion had he not convinced miss dashwood that what concerned her ought not escape his lips as it was it required but slight effort fancy connect his emotion with tender recollection past regard elinor attempted no more but marianne her place would not have done so little whole story would have been speedily formed under her active imagination every thing established most melancholy order disastrous love chapter xii as elinor marianne were walking together next morning latter communicated piece news her sister which spite all that she knew before marianne s imprudence want thought surprised her by its extravagant testimony both marianne told her with greatest delight that willoughby had given her horse one that he had bred himself on his estate somersetshire which was exactly calculated carry woman without considering that it was not her mother s plan keep any horse that if she were alter her resolution favour this gift she must buy another for servant keep servant ride it after all build stable receive them she had accepted present without hesitation told her sister it raptures he intends send his groom into somersetshire immediately for it she added when it arrives we will ride every day you shall share its use with me imagine yourself my dear elinor delight gallop on some these downs most unwilling was she awaken from such dream felicity comprehend all unhappy truths which attended affair for some time she refused submit them as additional servant expense would be trifle mama she was sure would never object it any horse would do for him he might always get one at park as stable merest shed would be sufficient elinor then ventured doubt propriety her receiving such present from man so little or at least so lately known her this was too much you are mistaken elinor said she warmly supposing i know very little willoughby i have not known him long indeed but i am much better acquainted with him than i am with any other creature world except yourself mama it is not time or opportunity that is determine intimacy it is disposition alone seven years would be insufficient make some people acquainted with each other seven days are more than enough for others i should hold myself guilty greater impropriety accepting horse from my brother than from willoughby john i know very little though we have lived together for years but willoughby my judgment has long been formed elinor thought it wisest touch that point no more she knew her sister s temper opposition on so tender subject would only attach her more her own opinion but by appeal her affection for her mother by representing inconveniences which that indulgent mother must draw on herself if as would probably be case she consented this increase establishment marianne was shortly subdued she promised not tempt her mother such imprudent kindness by mentioning offer tell willoughby when she saw him next that it must be declined she was faithful her word when willoughby called at cottage same day elinor heard her express her disappointment him low voice on being obliged forego acceptance his present reasons for this alteration were at same time related they were such as make further entreaty on his side impossible his concern however was very apparent after expressing it with earnestness he added same low voice but marianne horse is still yours though you cannot use it now i shall keep it only till you can claim it when you leave barton form your own establishment more lasting home queen mab shall receive you this was all overheard by miss dashwood whole sentence his manner pronouncing it his addressing her sister by her christian name alone she instantly saw intimacy so decided meaning so direct as marked perfect agreement between them from that moment she doubted not their being engaged each other belief it created no other surprise than that she or any their friends should be left by tempers so frank discover it by accident margaret related something her next day which placed this matter still clearer light willoughby had spent preceding evening with them margaret by being left some time parlour with only him marianne had had opportunity for observations which with most important face she communicated her eldest sister when they were next by themselves oh elinor she cried i have such secret tell you about marianne i am sure she will be married mr willoughby very soon you have said so replied elinor almost every day since they first met on high church down they had not known each other week i believe before you were certain that marianne wore his picture round her neck but it turned out be only miniature our great uncle but indeed this is quite another thing i am sure they will be married very soon for he has got lock her hair take care margaret it may be only hair some great uncle his but indeed elinor it is marianne s i am almost sure it is for i saw him cut it off last night after tea when you mama went out room they were whispering talking together as fast as could be he seemed be begging something her presently he took up her scissors cut off long lock her hair for it was all tumbled down her back he kissed it folded it up piece white paper put it into his pocket book for such particulars stated on such authority elinor could not withhold her credit nor was she disposed it for circumstance was perfect unison with what she had heard seen herself margaret s sagacity was not always displayed way so satisfactory her sister when mrs jennings attacked her one evening at park give name young man who was elinor s particular favourite which had been long matter great curiosity her margaret answered by looking at her sister saying i must not tell may i elinor this course made every body laugh elinor tried laugh too but effort was painful she was convinced that margaret had fixed on person whose name she could not bear with composure become standing joke with mrs jennings marianne felt for her most sincerely but she did more harm than good cause by turning very red saying angry manner margaret remember that whatever your conjectures may be you have no right repeat them i never had any conjectures about it replied margaret it was you who told me it yourself this increased mirth company margaret was eagerly pressed say something more oh pray miss margaret let us know all about it said mrs jennings what is gentleman s name i must not tell ma am but i know very well what it is i know where he is too yes yes we can guess where he is at his own house at norland be sure he is curate parish i dare say no that he is not he is no profession at all margaret said marianne with great warmth you know that all this is invention your own that there is no such person existence well then he is lately dead marianne for i am sure there was such man once his name begins with f most grateful did elinor feel lady middleton for observing at this moment that it rained very hard though she believed interruption proceed less from any attention her than from her ladyship s great dislike all such inelegant subjects raillery as delighted her husband mother idea however started by her was immediately pursued by colonel brandon who was on every occasion mindful feelings others much was said on subject rain by both them willoughby opened piano forte asked marianne sit down it thus amidst various endeavours different people quit topic it fell ground but not so easily did elinor recover from alarm into which it had thrown her party was formed this evening for going on following day see very fine place about twelve miles from barton belonging brother law colonel brandon without whose interest it could not be seen as proprietor who was then abroad had left strict orders on that head grounds were declared be highly beautiful sir john who was particularly warm their praise might be allowed be tolerable judge for he had formed parties visit them at least twice every summer for last ten years they contained noble piece water sail on which was form great part morning s amusement cold provisions were be taken open carriages only be employed every thing conducted usual style complete party pleasure some few company it appeared rather bold undertaking considering time year that it had rained every day for last fortnight mrs dashwood who had already cold was persuaded by elinor stay at home chapter xiii their intended excursion whitwell turned out very different from what elinor had expected she was prepared be wet through fatigued frightened but event was still more unfortunate for they did not go at all by ten o clock whole party was assembled at park where they were breakfast morning was rather favourable though it had rained all night as clouds were then dispersing across sky sun frequently appeared they were all high spirits good humour eager be happy determined submit greatest inconveniences hardships rather than be otherwise while they were at breakfast letters were brought among rest there was one for colonel brandon he took it looked at direction changed colour immediately left room what is matter with brandon said sir john nobody could tell i hope he has had no bad news said lady middleton it must be something extraordinary that could make colonel brandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly about five minutes he returned no bad news colonel i hope said mrs jennings as soon as he entered room none at all ma am i thank you was it from avignon i hope it is not say that your sister is worse no ma am it came from town is merely letter business but how came hand discompose you so much if it was only letter business come come this won t do colonel so let us hear truth it my dear madam said lady middleton recollect what you are saying perhaps it is tell you that your cousin fanny is married said mrs jennings without attending her daughter s reproof no indeed it is not well then i know who it is from colonel i hope she is well whom do you mean ma am said he colouring little oh you know who i mean i am particularly sorry ma am said he addressing lady middleton that i should receive this letter today for it is on business which requires my immediate attendance town town cried mrs jennings what can you have do town at this time year my own loss is great he continued being obliged leave so agreeable party but i am more concerned as i fear my presence is necessary gain your admittance at whitwell what blow upon them all was this but if you write note housekeeper mr brandon said marianne eagerly will it not be sufficient he shook his head we must go said sir john it shall not be put off when we are so near it you cannot go town till tomorrow brandon that is all i wish it could be so easily settled but it is not my power delay my journey for one day if you would but let us know what your business is said mrs jennings we might see whether it could be put off or not you would not be six hours later said willoughby if you were defer your journey till our return i cannot afford lose one hour elinor then heard willoughby say low voice marianne there are some people who cannot bear party pleasure brandon is one them he was afraid catching cold i dare say invented this trick for getting out it i would lay fifty guineas letter was his own writing i have no doubt it replied marianne there is no persuading you change your mind brandon i know old said sir john when once you are determined on anything but however i hope you will think better it consider here are two miss careys come over from newton three miss dashwoods walked up from cottage mr willoughby got up two hours before his usual time on purpose go whitwell colonel brandon again repeated his sorrow at being cause disappointing party but at same time declared it be unavoidable well then when will you come back again i hope we shall see you at barton added her ladyship as soon as you can conveniently leave town we must put off party whitwell till you return you are very obliging but it is so uncertain when i may have it my power return that i dare not engage for it at all oh he must shall come back cried sir john if he is not here by end week i shall go after him ay so do sir john cried mrs jennings then perhaps you may find out what his business is i do not want pry into other men s concerns i suppose it is something he is ashamed colonel brandon s horses were announced you do not go town on horseback do you added sir john no only honiton i shall then go post well as you are resolved go i wish you good journey but you had better change your mind i assure you it is not my power he then took leave whole party is there no chance my seeing you your sisters town this winter miss dashwood i am afraid none at all then i must bid you farewell for longer time than i should wish do marianne he merely bowed said nothing come colonel said mrs jennings before you go do let us know what you are going about he wished her good morning attended by sir john left room complaints lamentations which politeness had hitherto restrained now burst forth universally they all agreed again again how provoking it was be so disappointed i can guess what his business is however said mrs jennings exultingly can you ma am said almost every body yes it is about miss williams i am sure who is miss williams asked marianne what do not you know who miss williams is i am sure you must have heard her before she is relation colonel s my dear very near relation we will not say how near for fear shocking young ladies then lowering her voice little she said elinor she is his natural daughter indeed oh yes as like him as she can stare i dare say colonel will leave her all his fortune when sir john returned he joined most heartily general regret on so unfortunate event concluding however by observing that as they were all got together they must do something by way being happy after some consultation it was agreed that although happiness could only be enjoyed at whitwell they might procure tolerable composure mind by driving about country carriages were then ordered willoughby s was first marianne never looked happier than when she got into it he drove through park very fast they were soon out sight nothing more them was seen till their return which did not happen till after return all rest they both seemed delighted with their drive but said only general terms that they had kept lanes while others went on downs it was settled that there should be dance evening that every body should be extremely merry all day long some more careys came dinner they had pleasure sitting down nearly twenty table which sir john observed with great contentment willoughby took his usual place between two elder miss dashwoods mrs jennings sat on elinor s right hand they had not been long seated before she leant behind her willoughby said marianne loud enough for them both hear i have found you out spite all your tricks i know where you spent morning marianne coloured replied very hastily where pray did not you know said willoughby that we had been out my curricle yes yes mr impudence i know that very well i was determined find out where you had been i hope you like your house miss marianne it is very large one i know when i come see you i hope you will have new furnished it for it wanted it very much when i was there six years ago marianne turned away great confusion mrs jennings laughed heartily elinor found that her resolution know where they had been she had actually made her own woman enquire mr willoughby s groom that she had by that method been informed that they had gone allenham spent considerable time there walking about garden going all over house elinor could hardly believe this be true as it seemed very unlikely that willoughby should propose or marianne consent enter house while mrs smith was it with whom marianne had not smallest acquaintance as soon as they left dining room elinor enquired her about it great was her surprise when she found that every circumstance related by mrs jennings was perfectly true marianne was quite angry with her for doubting it why should you imagine elinor that we did not go there or that we did not see house is not it what you have often wished do yourself yes marianne but i would not go while mrs smith was there with no other companion than mr willoughby mr willoughby however is only person who can have right show that house as he went open carriage it was impossible have any other companion i never spent pleasanter morning my life i am afraid replied elinor that pleasantness employment does not always evince its propriety on contrary nothing can be stronger proof it elinor for if there had been any real impropriety what i did i should have been sensible it at time for we always know when we are acting wrong with such conviction i could have had no pleasure but my dear marianne as it has already exposed you some very impertinent remarks do you not now begin doubt discretion your own conduct if impertinent remarks mrs jennings are be proof impropriety conduct we are all offending every moment our lives i value not her censure any more than i should do her commendation i am not sensible having done anything wrong walking over mrs smith s grounds or seeing her house they will one day be mr willoughby s if they were one day be your own marianne you would not be justified what you have done she blushed at this hint but it was even visibly gratifying her after ten minutes interval earnest thought she came her sister again said with great good humour perhaps elinor it was rather ill judged me go allenham but mr willoughby wanted particularly show me place it is charming house i assure you there is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs nice comfortable size for constant use with modern furniture it would be delightful it is corner room has windows on two sides on one side you look across bowling green behind house beautiful hanging wood on other you have view church village beyond them those fine bold hills that we have so often admired i did not see it advantage for nothing could be more forlorn than furniture but if it were newly fitted up couple hundred pounds willoughby says would make it one pleasantest summer rooms england could elinor have listened her without interruption from others she would have described every room house with equal delight chapter xiv sudden termination colonel brandon s visit at park with his steadiness concealing its cause filled mind raised wonder mrs jennings for two or three days she was great wonderer as every one must be who takes very lively interest all comings goings all their acquaintance she wondered with little intermission what could be reason it was sure there must be some bad news thought over every kind distress that could have befallen him with fixed determination that he should not escape them all something very melancholy must be matter i am sure said she i could see it his face poor man i am afraid his circumstances may be bad estate at delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand year his brother left everything sadly involved i do think he must have been sent for about money matters for what else can it be i wonder whether it is so i would give anything know truth it perhaps it is about miss williams by bye i dare say it is because he looked so conscious when i mentioned her may be she is ill town nothing world more likely for i have notion she is always rather sickly i would lay any wager it is about miss williams it is not so very likely he should be distressed his circumstances now for he is very prudent man be sure must have cleared estate by this time i wonder what it can be may be his sister is worse at avignon has sent for him over his setting off such hurry seems very like it well i wish him out all his trouble with all my heart good wife into bargain so wondered so talked mrs jennings her opinion varying with every fresh conjecture all seeming equally probable as they arose elinor though she felt really interested welfare colonel brandon could not bestow all wonder on his going so suddenly away which mrs jennings was desirous her feeling for besides that circumstance did not her opinion justify such lasting amazement or variety speculation her wonder was otherwise disposed it was engrossed by extraordinary silence her sister willoughby on subject which they must know be peculiarly interesting them all as this silence continued every day made it appear more strange more incompatible with disposition both why they should not openly acknowledge her mother herself what their constant behaviour each other declared have taken place elinor could not imagine she could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately their power for though willoughby was independent there was no reason believe him rich his estate had been rated by sir john at about six or seven hundred year but he lived at expense which that income could hardly be equal he had himself often complained his poverty but for this strange kind secrecy maintained by them relative their engagement which fact concealed nothing at all she could not account it was so wholly contradictory their general opinions practice that doubt sometimes entered her mind their being really engaged this doubt was enough prevent her making any inquiry marianne nothing could be more expressive attachment them all than willoughby s behaviour marianne it had all distinguishing tenderness which lover s heart could give rest family it was affectionate attention son brother cottage seemed be considered loved by him as his home many more his hours were spent there than at allenham if no general engagement collected them at park exercise which called him out morning was almost certain ending there where rest day was spent by himself at side marianne by his favourite pointer at her feet one evening particular about week after colonel brandon left country his heart seemed more than usually open every feeling attachment objects around him on mrs dashwood s happening mention her design improving cottage spring he warmly opposed every alteration place which affection had established as perfect with him what he exclaimed improve this dear cottage no that i will never consent not stone must be added its walls not inch its size if my feelings are regarded do not be alarmed said miss dashwood nothing kind will be done for my mother will never have money enough attempt it i am heartily glad it he cried may she always be poor if she can employ her riches no better thank you willoughby but you may be assured that i would not sacrifice one sentiment local attachment yours or any one whom i loved for all improvements world depend upon it that whatever unemployed sum may remain when i make up my accounts spring i would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose it manner so painful you but are you really so attached this place as see no defect it i am said he me it is faultless nay more i consider it as only form building which happiness is attainable were i rich enough i would instantly pull combe down build it up again exact plan this cottage with dark narrow stairs kitchen that smokes i suppose said elinor yes cried he same eager tone with all every thing belonging it no one convenience or inconvenience about it should least variation be perceptible then then only under such roof i might perhaps be as happy at combe as i have been at barton i flatter myself replied elinor that even under disadvantage better rooms broader staircase you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you now do this there certainly are circumstances said willoughby which might greatly endear it me but this place will always have one claim my affection which no other can possibly share mrs dashwood looked with pleasure at marianne whose fine eyes were fixed so expressively on willoughby as plainly denoted how well she understood him how often did i wish added he when i was at allenham this time twelvemonth that barton cottage were inhabited i never passed within view it without admiring its situation grieving that no one should live it how little did i then think that very first news i should hear from mrs smith when i next came into country would be that barton cottage was taken i felt immediate satisfaction interest event which nothing but kind prescience what happiness i should experience from it can account for must it not have been so marianne speaking her lowered voice then continuing his former tone he said yet this house you would spoil mrs dashwood you would rob it its simplicity by imaginary improvement this dear parlour which our acquaintance first began which so many happy hours have been since spent by us together you would degrade condition common entrance every body would be eager pass through room which has hitherto contained within itself more real accommodation comfort than any other apartment handsomest dimensions world could possibly afford mrs dashwood again assured him that no alteration kind should be attempted you are good woman he warmly replied your promise makes me easy extend it little farther it will make me happy tell me that not only your house will remain same but that i shall ever find you yours as unchanged as your dwelling that you will always consider me with kindness which has made everything belonging you so dear me promise was readily given willoughby s behaviour during whole evening declared at once his affection happiness shall we see you tomorrow dinner said mrs dashwood when he was leaving them i do not ask you come morning for we must walk park call on lady middleton he engaged be with them by four o clock chapter xv mrs dashwood s visit lady middleton took place next day two her daughters went with her but marianne excused herself from being party under some trifling pretext employment her mother who concluded that promise had been made by willoughby night before calling on her while they were absent was perfectly satisfied with her remaining at home on their return from park they found willoughby s curricle servant waiting at cottage mrs dashwood was convinced that her conjecture had been just so far it was all as she had foreseen but on entering house she beheld what no foresight had taught her expect they were no sooner passage than marianne came hastily out parlour apparently violent affliction with her handkerchief at her eyes without noticing them ran up stairs surprised alarmed they proceeded directly into room she had just quitted where they found only willoughby who was leaning against mantel piece with his back towards them he turned round on their coming his countenance showed that he strongly partook emotion which over powered marianne is anything matter with her cried mrs dashwood as she entered is she ill i hope not he replied trying look cheerful with forced smile presently added it is i who may rather expect be ill for i am now suffering under very heavy disappointment disappointment yes for i am unable keep my engagement with you mrs smith has this morning exercised privilege riches upon poor dependent cousin by sending me on business london i have just received my dispatches taken my farewell allenham by way exhilaration i am now come take my farewell you london are you going this morning almost this moment this is very unfortunate but mrs smith must be obliged her business will not detain you from us long i hope he coloured as he replied you are very kind but i have no idea returning into devonshire immediately my visits mrs smith are never repeated within twelvemonth is mrs smith your only friend is allenham only house neighbourhood which you will be welcome for shame willoughby can you wait for invitation here his colour increased with his eyes fixed on ground he only replied you are too good mrs dashwood looked at elinor with surprise elinor felt equal amazement for few moments every one was silent mrs dashwood first spoke i have only add my dear willoughby that at barton cottage you will always be welcome for i will not press you return here immediately because you only can judge how far that might be pleasing mrs smith on this head i shall be no more disposed question your judgment than doubt your inclination my engagements at present replied willoughby confusedly are such nature that i dare not flatter myself he stopped mrs dashwood was too much astonished speak another pause succeeded this was broken by willoughby who said with faint smile it is folly linger this manner i will not torment myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is impossible for me now enjoy he then hastily took leave them all left room they saw him step into his carriage minute it was out sight mrs dashwood felt too much for speech instantly quitted parlour give way solitude concern alarm which this sudden departure occasioned elinor s uneasiness was at least equal her mother s she thought what had just passed with anxiety distrust willoughby s behaviour taking leave them his embarrassment affectation cheerfulness above all his unwillingness accept her mother s invitation backwardness so unlike lover so unlike himself greatly disturbed her one moment she feared that no serious design had ever been formed on his side next that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him her sister distress which marianne had quitted room was such as serious quarrel could most reasonably account for though when she considered what marianne s love for him was quarrel seemed almost impossible but whatever might be particulars their separation her sister s affliction was indubitable she thought with tenderest compassion that violent sorrow which marianne was all probability not merely giving way as relief but feeding encouraging as duty about half hour her mother returned though her eyes were red her countenance was not uncheerful our dear willoughby is now some miles from barton elinor said she as she sat down work with how heavy heart does he travel it is all very strange so suddenly be gone it seems but work moment last night he was with us so happy so cheerful so affectionate now after only ten minutes notice gone too without intending return something more than what he owned us must have happened he did not speak he did not behave like himself you must have seen difference as well as i what can it be can they have quarrelled why else should he have shown such unwillingness accept your invitation here it was not inclination that he wanted elinor i could plainly see that he had not power accepting it i have thought it all over i assure you i can perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed strange me as well as you can you indeed yes i have explained it myself most satisfactory way but you elinor who love doubt where you can it will not satisfy you i know but you shall not talk me out my trust it i am persuaded that mrs smith suspects his regard for marianne disapproves it perhaps because she has other views for him on that account is eager get him away that business which she sends him off transact is invented as excuse dismiss him this is what i believe have happened he is moreover aware that she does disapprove connection he dares not therefore at present confess her his engagement with marianne he feels himself obliged from his dependent situation give into her schemes absent himself from devonshire for while you will tell me i know that this may or may not have happened but i will listen no cavil unless you can point out any other method understanding affair as satisfactory at this now elinor what have you say nothing for you have anticipated my answer then you would have told me that it might or might not have happened oh elinor how incomprehensible are your feelings you had rather take evil upon credit than good you had rather look out for misery for marianne guilt for poor willoughby than apology for latter you are resolved think him blameable because he took leave us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shown is no allowance be made for inadvertence or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment are no probabilities be accepted merely because they are not certainties is nothing due man whom we have all such reason love no reason world think ill possibility motives unanswerable themselves though unavoidably secret for while after all what is it you suspect him i can hardly tell myself but suspicion something unpleasant is inevitable consequence such alteration as we just witnessed him there is great truth however what you have now urged allowances which ought be made for him it is my wish be candid my judgment every body willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient reasons for his conduct i will hope that he has but it would have been more like willoughby acknowledge them at once secrecy may be advisable but still i cannot help wondering at its being practiced by him do not blame him however for departing from his character where deviation is necessary but you really do admit justice what i have said his defence i am happy he is acquitted not entirely it may be proper conceal their engagement if they are engaged from mrs smith if that is case it must be highly expedient for willoughby be but little devonshire at present but this is no excuse for their concealing it from us concealing it from us my dear child do you accuse willoughby marianne concealment this is strange indeed when your eyes have been reproaching them every day for incautiousness i want no proof their affection said elinor but their engagement i do i am perfectly satisfied both yet not syllable has been said you on subject by either them i have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly has not his behaviour marianne all us for at least last fortnight declared that he loved considered her as his future wife that he felt for us attachment nearest relation have we not perfectly understood each other has not my consent been daily asked by his looks his manner his attentive affectionate respect my elinor is it possible doubt their engagement how could such thought occur you how is it be supposed that willoughby persuaded as he must be your sister s love should leave her leave her perhaps for months without telling her his affection that they should part without mutual exchange confidence i confess replied elinor that every circumstance except one is favour their engagement but that one is total silence both on subject with me it almost outweighs every other how strange this is you must think wretchedly indeed willoughby if after all that has openly passed between them you can doubt nature terms on which they are together has he been acting part his behaviour your sister all this time do you suppose him really indifferent her no i cannot think that he must does love her i am sure but with strange kind tenderness if he can leave her with such indifference such carelessness future as you attribute him you must remember my dear mother that i have never considered this matter as certain i have had my doubts i confess but they are fainter than they were they may soon be entirely done away if we find they correspond every fear mine will be removed mighty concession indeed if you were see them at altar you would suppose they were going be married ungracious girl but i require no such proof nothing my opinion has ever passed justify doubt no secrecy has been attempted all has been uniformly open unreserved you cannot doubt your sister s wishes it must be willoughby therefore whom you suspect but why is he not man honour feeling has there been any inconsistency on his side create alarm can he be deceitful i hope not i believe not cried elinor i love willoughby sincerely love him suspicion his integrity cannot be more painful yourself than me it has been involuntary i will not encourage it i was startled i confess by alteration his manners this morning he did not speak like himself did not return your kindness with any cordiality but all this may be explained by such situation his affairs as you have supposed he had just parted from my sister had seen her leave him greatest affliction if he felt obliged from fear offending mrs smith resist temptation returning here soon yet aware that by declining your invitation by saying that he was going away for some time he should seem act ungenerous suspicious part by our family he might well be embarrassed disturbed such case plain open avowal his difficulties would have been more his honour i think as well as more consistent with his general character but i will not raise objections against any one s conduct on so illiberal foundation as difference judgment from myself or deviation from what i may think right consistent you speak very properly willoughby certainly does not deserve be suspected though we have not known him long he is no stranger this part world who has ever spoken his disadvantage had he been situation act independently marry immediately it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging everything me at once but this is not case it is engagement some respects not prosperously begun for their marriage must be at very uncertain distance even secrecy as far as it can be observed may now be very advisable they were interrupted by entrance margaret elinor was then at liberty think over representations her mother acknowledge probability many hope for justice all they saw nothing marianne till dinner time when she entered room took her place at table without saying word her eyes were red swollen it seemed as if her tears were even then restrained with difficulty she avoided looks them all could neither eat nor speak after some time on her mother s silently pressing her hand with tender compassion her small degree fortitude was quite overcome she burst into tears left room this violent oppression spirits continued whole evening she was without any power because she was without any desire command over herself slightest mention anything relative willoughby overpowered her instant though her family were most anxiously attentive her comfort it was impossible for them if they spoke at all keep clear every subject which her feelings connected with him chapter xvi marianne would have thought herself very inexcusable had she been able sleep at all first night after parting from willoughby she would have been ashamed look her family face next morning had she not risen from her bed more need repose than when she lay down it but feelings which made such composure disgrace left her no danger incurring it she was awake whole night she wept greatest part it she got up with headache was unable talk unwilling take any nourishment giving pain every moment her mother sisters forbidding all attempt at consolation from either her sensibility was potent enough when breakfast was over she walked out by herself wandered about village allenham indulging recollection past enjoyment crying over present reverse for chief morning evening passed off equal indulgence feeling she played over every favourite song that she had been used play willoughby every air which their voices had been oftenest joined sat at instrument gazing on every line music that he had written out for her till her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness could be gained this nourishment grief was every day applied she spent whole hours at pianoforte alternately singing crying her voice often totally suspended by her tears books too as well as music she courted misery which contrast between past present was certain giving she read nothing but what they had been used read together such violence affliction indeed could not be supported for ever it sunk within few days into calmer melancholy but these employments which she daily recurred her solitary walks silent meditations still produced occasional effusions sorrow as lively as ever no letter from willoughby came none seemed expected by marianne her mother was surprised elinor again became uneasy but mrs dashwood could find explanations whenever she wanted them which at least satisfied herself remember elinor said she how very often sir john fetches our letters himself from post carries them it we have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary we must acknowledge that it could not be maintained if their correspondence were pass through sir john s hands elinor could not deny truth this she tried find it motive sufficient for their silence but there was one method so direct so simple her opinion so eligible knowing real state affair instantly removing all mystery that she could not help suggesting it her mother why do you not ask marianne at once said she whether she is or she is not engaged willoughby from you her mother so kind so indulgent mother question could not give offence it would be natural result your affection for her she used be all unreserve you more especially i would not ask such question for world supposing it possible that they are not engaged what distress would not such enquiry inflict at any rate it would be most ungenerous i should never deserve her confidence again after forcing from her confession what is meant at present be unacknowledged any one i know marianne s heart i know that she dearly loves me that i shall not be last whom affair is made known when circumstances make revealment it eligible i would not attempt force confidence any one child much less because sense duty would prevent denial which her wishes might direct elinor thought this generosity overstrained considering her sister s youth urged matter farther but vain common sense common care common prudence were all sunk mrs dashwood s romantic delicacy it was several days before willoughby s name was mentioned before marianne by any her family sir john mrs jennings indeed were not so nice their witticisms added pain many painful hour but one evening mrs dashwood accidentally taking up volume shakespeare exclaimed we have never finished hamlet marianne our dear willoughby went away before we could get through it we will put it by that when he comes again but it may be months perhaps before that happens months cried marianne with strong surprise no nor many weeks mrs dashwood was sorry for what she had said but it gave elinor pleasure as it produced reply from marianne so expressive confidence willoughby knowledge his intentions one morning about week after his leaving country marianne was prevailed on join her sisters their usual walk instead wandering away by herself hitherto she had carefully avoided every companion her rambles if her sisters intended walk on downs she directly stole away towards lanes if they talked valley she was as speedy climbing hills could never be found when others set off but at length she was secured by exertions elinor who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion they walked along road through valley chiefly silence for marianne s mind could not be controlled elinor satisfied with gaining one point would not then attempt more beyond entrance valley where country though still rich was less wild more open long stretch road which they had travelled on first coming barton lay before them on reaching that point they stopped look around them examine prospect which formed distance their view from cottage from spot which they had never happened reach any their walks before amongst objects scene they soon discovered animated one it was man on horseback riding towards them few minutes they could distinguish him be gentleman moment afterwards marianne rapturously exclaimed it is he it is indeed i know it is was hastening meet him when elinor cried out indeed marianne i think you are mistaken it is not willoughby person is not tall enough for him has not his air he has he has cried marianne i am sure he has his air his coat his horse i knew how soon he would come she walked eagerly on as she spoke elinor screen marianne from particularity as she felt almost certain its not being willoughby quickened her pace kept up with her they were soon within thirty yards gentleman marianne looked again her heart sunk within her abruptly turning round she was hurrying back when voices both her sisters were raised detain her third almost as well known as willoughby s joined them begging her stop she turned round with surprise see welcome edward ferrars he was only person world who could at that moment be forgiven for not being willoughby only one who could have gained smile from her but she dispersed her tears smile on him her sister s happiness forgot for time her own disappointment he dismounted giving his horse his servant walked back with them barton whither he was purposely coming visit them he was welcomed by them all with great cordiality but especially by marianne who showed more warmth regard her reception him than even elinor herself marianne indeed meeting between edward her sister was but continuation that unaccountable coldness which she had often observed at norland their mutual behaviour on edward s side more particularly there was deficiency all that lover ought look say on such occasion he was confused seemed scarcely sensible pleasure seeing them looked neither rapturous nor gay said little but what was forced from him by questions distinguished elinor by no mark affection marianne saw listened with increasing surprise she began almost feel dislike edward it ended as every feeling must end with her by carrying back her thoughts willoughby whose manners formed contrast sufficiently striking those his brother elect after short silence which succeeded first surprise enquiries meeting marianne asked edward if he came directly from london no he had been devonshire fortnight fortnight she repeated surprised at his being so long same county with elinor without seeing her before he looked rather distressed as he added that he had been staying with some friends near plymouth have you been lately sussex said elinor i was at norland about month ago how does dear dear norland look cried marianne dear dear norland said elinor probably looks much as it always does at this time year woods walks thickly covered with dead leaves oh cried marianne with what transporting sensation have i formerly seen them fall how have i delighted as i walked see them driven showers about me by wind what feelings have they season air altogether inspired now there is no one regard them they are seen only as nuisance swept hastily off driven as much as possible from sight it is not every one said elinor who has your passion for dead leaves no my feelings are not often shared not often understood but sometimes they are as she said this she sunk into reverie for few moments but rousing herself again now edward said she calling his attention prospect here is barton valley look up it be tranquil if you can look at those hills did you ever see their equals left is barton park amongst those woods plantations you may see end house there beneath that farthest hill which rises with such grandeur is our cottage it is beautiful country he replied but these bottoms must be dirty winter how can you think dirt with such objects before you because replied he smiling among rest objects before me i see very dirty lane how strange said marianne herself as she walked on have you agreeable neighbourhood here are middletons pleasant people no not all answered marianne we could not be more unfortunately situated marianne cried her sister how can you say so how can you be so unjust they are very respectable family mr ferrars towards us have behaved friendliest manner have you forgot marianne how many pleasant days we have owed them no said marianne low voice nor how many painful moments elinor took no notice this directing her attention their visitor endeavoured support something like discourse with him by talking their present residence its conveniences c extorting from him occasional questions remarks his coldness reserve mortified her severely she was vexed half angry but resolving regulate her behaviour him by past rather than present she avoided every appearance resentment or displeasure treated him as she thought he ought be treated from family connection chapter xvii mrs dashwood was surprised only for moment at seeing him for his coming barton was her opinion all things most natural her joy expression regard long outlived her wonder he received kindest welcome from her shyness coldness reserve could not stand against such reception they had begun fail him before he entered house they were quite overcome by captivating manners mrs dashwood indeed man could not very well be love with either her daughters without extending passion her elinor had satisfaction seeing him soon become more like himself his affections seemed reanimate towards them all his interest their welfare again became perceptible he was not spirits however he praised their house admired its prospect was attentive kind but still he was not spirits whole family perceived it mrs dashwood attributing it some want liberality his mother sat down table indignant against all selfish parents what are mrs ferrars s views for you at present edward said she when dinner was over they had drawn round fire are you still be great orator spite yourself no i hope my mother is now convinced that i have no more talents than inclination for public life but how is your fame be established for famous you must be satisfy all your family with no inclination for expense no affection for strangers no profession no assurance you may find it difficult matter i shall not attempt it i have no wish be distinguished have every reason hope i never shall thank heaven i cannot be forced into genius eloquence you have no ambition i well know your wishes are all moderate as moderate as those rest world i believe i wish as well as every body else be perfectly happy but like every body else it must be my own way greatness will not make me so strange that it would cried marianne what have wealth or grandeur do with happiness grandeur has but little said elinor but wealth has much do with it elinor for shame said marianne money can only give happiness where there is nothing else give it beyond competence it can afford no real satisfaction as far as mere self is concerned perhaps said elinor smiling we may come same point your competence my wealth are very much alike i dare say without them as world goes now we shall both agree that every kind external comfort must be wanting your ideas are only more noble than mine come what is your competence about eighteen hundred or two thousand year not more than that elinor laughed two thousand year one is my wealth i guessed how it would end yet two thousand year is very moderate income said marianne family cannot well be maintained on smaller i am sure i am not extravagant my demands proper establishment servants carriage perhaps two hunters cannot be supported on less elinor smiled again hear her sister describing so accurately their future expenses at combe magna hunters repeated edward but why must you have hunters every body does not hunt marianne coloured as she replied but most people do i wish said margaret striking out novel thought that somebody would give us all large fortune apiece oh that they would cried marianne her eyes sparkling with animation her cheeks glowing with delight such imaginary happiness we are all unanimous that wish i suppose said elinor spite insufficiency wealth oh dear cried margaret how happy i should be i wonder what i should do with it marianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point i should be puzzled spend so large fortune myself said mrs dashwood if my children were all be rich without my help you must begin your improvements on this house observed elinor your difficulties will soon vanish what magnificent orders would travel from this family london said edward such event what happy day for booksellers music sellers print shops you miss dashwood would give general commission for every new print merit be sent you as for marianne i know her greatness soul there would not be music enough london content her books thomson cowper scott she would buy them all over over again she would buy up every copy i believe prevent their falling into unworthy hands she would have every book that tells her how admire old twisted tree should not you marianne forgive me if i am very saucy but i was willing show you that i had not forgot our old disputes i love be reminded past edward whether it be melancholy or gay i love recall it you will never offend me by talking former times you are very right supposing how my money would be spent some it at least my loose cash would certainly be employed improving my collection music books bulk your fortune would be laid out annuities on authors or their heirs no edward i should have something else do with it perhaps then you would bestow it as reward on that person who wrote ablest defence your favourite maxim that no one can ever be love more than once their life your opinion on that point is unchanged i presume undoubtedly at my time life opinions are tolerably fixed it is not likely that i should now see or hear any thing change them marianne is as steadfast as ever you see said elinor she is not at all altered she is only grown little more grave than she was nay edward said marianne you need not reproach me you are not very gay yourself why should you think so replied he with sigh but gaiety never was part my character nor do i think it part marianne s said elinor i should hardly call her lively girl she is very earnest very eager all she does sometimes talks great deal always with animation but she is not often really merry i believe you are right he replied yet i have always set her down as lively girl i have frequently detected myself such kind mistakes said elinor total misapprehension character some point or other fancying people so much more gay or grave or ingenious or stupid than they really are i can hardly tell why or what deception originated sometimes one is guided by what they say themselves very frequently by what other people say them without giving oneself time deliberate judge but i thought it was right elinor said marianne be guided wholly by opinion other people i thought our judgments were given us merely be subservient those neighbours this has always been your doctrine i am sure no marianne never my doctrine has never aimed at subjection understanding all i have ever attempted influence has been behaviour you must not confound my meaning i am guilty i confess having often wished you treat our acquaintance general with greater attention but when have i advised you adopt their sentiments or conform their judgment serious matters you have not been able bring your sister over your plan general civility said edward elinor do you gain no ground quite contrary replied elinor looking expressively at marianne my judgment he returned is all on your side question but i am afraid my practice is much more on your sister s i never wish offend but i am so foolishly shy that i often seem negligent when i am only kept back by my natural awkwardness i have frequently thought that i must have been intended by nature be fond low company i am so little at my ease among strangers gentility marianne has not shyness excuse any inattention hers said elinor she knows her own worth too well for false shame replied edward shyness is only effect sense inferiority some way or other if i could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy graceful i should not be shy but you would still be reserved said marianne that is worse edward started reserved am i reserved marianne yes very i do not understand you replied he colouring reserved how what manner what am i tell you what can you suppose elinor looked surprised at his emotion but trying laugh off subject she said him do not you know my sister well enough understand what she means do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast admire what she admires as rapturously as herself edward made no answer his gravity thoughtfulness returned on him their fullest extent he sat for some time silent dull chapter xviii elinor saw with great uneasiness low spirits her friend his visit afforded her but very partial satisfaction while his own enjoyment it appeared so imperfect it was evident that he was unhappy she wished it were equally evident that he still distinguished her by same affection which once she had felt no doubt inspiring but hitherto continuance his preference seemed very uncertain reservedness his manner towards her contradicted one moment what more animated look had intimated preceding one he joined her marianne breakfast room next morning before others were down marianne who was always eager promote their happiness as far as she could soon left them themselves but before she was half way upstairs she heard parlour door open turning round was astonished see edward himself come out i am going into village see my horses said he as you are not yet ready for breakfast i shall be back again presently edward returned them with fresh admiration surrounding country his walk village he had seen many parts valley advantage village itself much higher situation than cottage afforded general view whole which had exceedingly pleased him this was subject which ensured marianne s attention she was beginning describe her own admiration these scenes question him more minutely on objects that had particularly struck him when edward interrupted her by saying you must not enquire too far marianne remember i have no knowledge picturesque i shall offend you by my ignorance want taste if we come particulars i shall call hills steep which ought be bold surfaces strange uncouth which ought be irregular rugged distant objects out sight which ought only be indistinct through soft medium hazy atmosphere you must be satisfied with such admiration as i can honestly give i call it very fine country hills are steep woods seem full fine timber valley looks comfortable snug with rich meadows several neat farm houses scattered here there it exactly answers my idea fine country because it unites beauty with utility i dare say it is picturesque one too because you admire it i can easily believe it be full rocks promontories grey moss brush wood but these are all lost on me i know nothing picturesque i am afraid it is but too true said marianne but why should you boast it i suspect said elinor that avoid one kind affectation edward here falls into another because he believes many people pretend more admiration beauties nature than they really feel is disgusted with such pretensions he affects greater indifference less discrimination viewing them himself than he possesses he is fastidious will have affectation his own it is very true said marianne that admiration landscape scenery is become mere jargon every body pretends feel tries describe with taste elegance him who first defined what picturesque beauty was i detest jargon every kind sometimes i have kept my feelings myself because i could find no language describe them but what was worn hackneyed out all sense meaning i am convinced said edward that you really feel all delight fine prospect which you profess feel but return your sister must allow me feel no more than i profess i like fine prospect but not on picturesque principles i do not like crooked twisted blasted trees i admire them much more if they are tall straight flourishing i do not like ruined tattered cottages i am not fond nettles or thistles or heath blossoms i have more pleasure snug farm house than watch tower troop tidy happy villagers please me better than finest banditti world marianne looked with amazement at edward with compassion at her sister elinor only laughed subject was continued no farther marianne remained thoughtfully silent till new object suddenly engaged her attention she was sitting by edward taking his tea from mrs dashwood his hand passed so directly before her as make ring with plait hair centre very conspicuous on one his fingers i never saw you wear ring before edward she cried is that fanny s hair i remember her promising give you some but i should have thought her hair had been darker marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt but when she saw how much she had pained edward her own vexation at her want thought could not be surpassed by his he coloured very deeply giving momentary glance at elinor replied yes it is my sister s hair setting always casts different shade on it you know elinor had met his eye looked conscious likewise that hair was her own she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as marianne only difference their conclusions was that what marianne considered as free gift from her sister elinor was conscious must have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown herself she was not humour however regard it as affront affecting take no notice what passed by instantly talking something else she internally resolved henceforward catch every opportunity eyeing hair satisfying herself beyond all doubt that it was exactly shade her own edward s embarrassment lasted some time it ended absence mind still more settled he was particularly grave whole morning marianne severely censured herself for what she had said but her own forgiveness might have been more speedy had she known how little offence it had given her sister before middle day they were visited by sir john mrs jennings who having heard arrival gentleman at cottage came take survey guest with assistance his mother law sir john was not long discovering that name ferrars began with f this prepared future mine raillery against devoted elinor which nothing but newness their acquaintance with edward could have prevented from being immediately sprung but as it was she only learned from some very significant looks how far their penetration founded on margaret s instructions extended sir john never came dashwoods without either inviting them dine at park next day or drink tea with them that evening on present occasion for better entertainment their visitor towards whose amusement he felt himself bound contribute he wished engage them for both you must drink tea with us night said he for we shall be quite alone tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us for we shall be large party mrs jennings enforced necessity who knows but you may raise dance said she that will tempt you miss marianne dance cried marianne impossible who is dance who why yourselves careys whitakers be sure what you thought nobody could dance because certain person that shall be nameless is gone i wish with all my soul cried sir john that willoughby were among us again this marianne s blushing gave new suspicions edward who is willoughby said he low voice miss dashwood by whom he was sitting she gave him brief reply marianne s countenance was more communicative edward saw enough comprehend not only meaning others but such marianne s expressions as had puzzled him before when their visitors left them he went immediately round her said whisper i have been guessing shall i tell you my guess what do you mean shall i tell you certainly well then i guess that mr willoughby hunts marianne was surprised confused yet she could not help smiling at quiet archness his manner after moment s silence said oh edward how can you but time will come i hope i am sure you will like him i do not doubt it replied he rather astonished at her earnestness warmth for had he not imagined it be joke for good her acquaintance general founded only on something or nothing between mr willoughby herself he would not have ventured mention it chapter xix edward remained week at cottage he was earnestly pressed by mrs dashwood stay longer but as if he were bent only on self mortification he seemed resolved be gone when his enjoyment among his friends was at height his spirits during last two or three days though still very unequal were greatly improved he grew more more partial house environs never spoke going away without sigh declared his time be wholly disengaged even doubted what place he should go when he left them but still go he must never had any week passed so quickly he could hardly believe it be gone he said so repeatedly other things he said too which marked turn his feelings gave lie his actions he had no pleasure at norland he detested being town but either norland or london he must go he valued their kindness beyond any thing his greatest happiness was being with them yet he must leave them at end week spite their wishes his own without any restraint on his time elinor placed all that was astonishing this way acting his mother s account it was happy for her that he had mother whose character was so imperfectly known her as be general excuse for every thing strange on part her son disappointed however vexed as she was sometimes displeased with his uncertain behaviour herself she was very well disposed on whole regard his actions with all candid allowances generous qualifications which had been rather more painfully extorted from her for willoughby s service by her mother his want spirits openness consistency were most usually attributed his want independence his better knowledge mrs ferrars s disposition designs shortness his visit steadiness his purpose leaving them originated same fettered inclination same inevitable necessity temporizing with his mother old well established grievance duty against will parent against child was cause all she would have been glad know when these difficulties were cease this opposition was yield when mrs ferrars would be reformed her son be at liberty be happy but from such vain wishes she was forced turn for comfort renewal her confidence edward s affection remembrance every mark regard look or word which fell from him while at barton above all that flattering proof it which he constantly wore round his finger i think edward said mrs dashwood as they were at breakfast last morning you would be happier man if you had any profession engage your time give interest your plans actions some inconvenience your friends indeed might result from it you would not be able give them so much your time but with smile you would be materially benefited one particular at least you would know where go when you left them i do assure you he replied that i have long thought on this point as you think now it has been is probably will always be heavy misfortune me that i have had no necessary business engage me no profession give me employment or afford me any thing like independence but unfortunately my own nicety nicety my friends have made me what i am idle helpless being we never could agree our choice profession i always preferred church as i still do but that was not smart enough for my family they recommended army that was great deal too smart for me law was allowed be genteel enough many young men who had chambers temple made very good appearance first circles drove about town very knowing gigs but i had no inclination for law even this less abstruse study it which my family approved as for navy it had fashion on its side but i was too old when subject was first started enter it at length as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all as i might be as dashing expensive without red coat on my back as with one idleness was pronounced on whole be most advantageous honourable young man eighteen is not general so earnestly bent on being busy as resist solicitations his friends do nothing i was therefore entered at oxford have been properly idle ever since consequence which i suppose will be said mrs dashwood since leisure has not promoted your own happiness that your sons will be brought up as many pursuits employments professions trades as columella s they will be brought up said he serious accent be as unlike myself as is possible feeling action condition every thing come come this is all effusion immediate want spirits edward you are melancholy humour fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy but remember that pain parting from friends will be felt by every body at times whatever be their education or state know your own happiness you want nothing but patience or give it more fascinating name call it hope your mother will secure you time that independence you are so anxious for it is her duty it will it must ere long become her happiness prevent your whole youth from being wasted discontent how much may not few months do i think replied edward that i may defy many months produce any good me this desponding turn mind though it could not be communicated mrs dashwood gave additional pain them all parting which shortly took place left uncomfortable impression on elinor s feelings especially which required some trouble time subdue but as it was her determination subdue it prevent herself from appearing suffer more than what all her family suffered on his going away she did not adopt method so judiciously employed by marianne on similar occasion augment fix her sorrow by seeking silence solitude idleness their means were as different as their objects equally suited advancement each elinor sat down her drawing table as soon as he was out house busily employed herself whole day neither sought nor avoided mention his name appeared interest herself almost as much as ever general concerns family if by this conduct she did not lessen her own grief it was at least prevented from unnecessary increase her mother sisters were spared much solicitude on her account such behaviour as this so exactly reverse her own appeared no more meritorious marianne than her own had seemed faulty her business self command she settled very easily with strong affections it was impossible with calm ones it could have no merit that her sister s affections were calm she dared not deny though she blushed acknowledge it strength her own she gave very striking proof by still loving respecting that sister spite this mortifying conviction without shutting herself up from her family or leaving house determined solitude avoid them or lying awake whole night indulge meditation elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough think edward edward s behaviour every possible variety which different state her spirits at different times could produce with tenderness pity approbation censure doubt there were moments abundance when if not by absence her mother sisters at least by nature their employments conversation was forbidden among them every effect solitude was produced her mind was inevitably at liberty her thoughts could not be chained elsewhere past future on subject so interesting must be before her must force her attention engross her memory her reflection her fancy from reverie this kind as she sat at her drawing table she was roused one morning soon after edward s leaving them by arrival company she happened be quite alone closing little gate at entrance green court front house drew her eyes window she saw large party walking up door amongst them were sir john lady middleton mrs jennings but there were two others gentleman lady who were quite unknown her she was sitting near window as soon as sir john perceived her he left rest party ceremony knocking at door stepping across turf obliged her open casement speak him though space was so short between door window as make it hardly possible speak at one without being heard at other well said he we have brought you some strangers how do you like them hush they will hear you never mind if they do it is only palmers charlotte is very pretty i can tell you you may see her if you look this way as elinor was certain seeing her couple minutes without taking that liberty she begged be excused where is marianne has she run away because we are come i see her instrument is open she is walking i believe they were now joined by mrs jennings who had not patience enough wait till door was opened before she told her story she came hallooing window how do you do my dear how does mrs dashwood do where are your sisters what all alone you will be glad little company sit with you i have brought my other son daughter see you only think their coming so suddenly i thought i heard carriage last night while we were drinking our tea but it never entered my head that it could be them i thought nothing but whether it might not be colonel brandon come back again so i said sir john i do think i hear carriage perhaps it is colonel brandon come back again elinor was obliged turn from her middle her story receive rest party lady middleton introduced two strangers mrs dashwood margaret came down stairs at same time they all sat down look at one another while mrs jennings continued her story as she walked through passage into parlour attended by sir john mrs palmer was several years younger than lady middleton totally unlike her every respect she was short plump had very pretty face finest expression good humour it that could possibly be her manners were by no means so elegant as her sister s but they were much more prepossessing she came with smile smiled all time her visit except when she laughed smiled when she went away her husband was grave looking young man five or six twenty with air more fashion sense than his wife but less willingness please or be pleased he entered room with look self consequence slightly bowed ladies without speaking word after briefly surveying them their apartments took up newspaper from table continued read it as long as he staid mrs palmer on contrary who was strongly endowed by nature with turn for being uniformly civil happy was hardly seated before her admiration parlour every thing it burst forth well what delightful room this is i never saw anything so charming only think mama how it is improved since i was here last i always thought it such sweet place ma am turning mrs dashwood but you have made it so charming only look sister how delightful every thing is how i should like such house for myself should not you mr palmer mr palmer made her no answer did not even raise his eyes from newspaper mr palmer does not hear me said she laughing he never does sometimes it is so ridiculous this was quite new idea mrs dashwood she had never been used find wit inattention any one could not help looking with surprise at them both mrs jennings meantime talked on as loud as she could continued her account their surprise evening before on seeing their friends without ceasing till every thing was told mrs palmer laughed heartily at recollection their astonishment every body agreed two or three times over that it had been quite agreeable surprise you may believe how glad we all were see them added mrs jennings leaning forward towards elinor speaking low voice as if she meant be heard by no one else though they were seated on different sides room but however i can t help wishing they had not travelled quite so fast nor made such long journey it for they came all round by london upon account some business for you know nodding significantly pointing her daughter it was wrong her situation i wanted her stay at home rest this morning but she would come with us she longed so much see you all mrs palmer laughed said it would not do her any harm she expects be confined february continued mrs jennings lady middleton could no longer endure such conversation therefore exerted herself ask mr palmer if there was any news paper no none at all he replied read on here comes marianne cried sir john now palmer you shall see monstrous pretty girl he immediately went into passage opened front door ushered her himself mrs jennings asked her as soon as she appeared if she had not been allenham mrs palmer laughed so heartily at question as show she understood it mr palmer looked up on her entering room stared at her some minutes then returned his newspaper mrs palmer s eye was now caught by drawings which hung round room she got up examine them oh dear how beautiful these are well how delightful do but look mama how sweet i declare they are quite charming i could look at them for ever then sitting down again she very soon forgot that there were any such things room when lady middleton rose go away mr palmer rose also laid down newspaper stretched himself looked at them all around my love have you been asleep said his wife laughing he made her no answer only observed after again examining room that it was very low pitched that ceiling was crooked he then made his bow departed with rest sir john had been very urgent with them all spend next day at park mrs dashwood who did not chuse dine with them oftener than they dined at cottage absolutely refused on her own account her daughters might do as they pleased but they had no curiosity see how mr mrs palmer ate their dinner no expectation pleasure from them any other way they attempted therefore likewise excuse themselves weather was uncertain not likely be good but sir john would not be satisfied carriage should be sent for them they must come lady middleton too though she did not press their mother pressed them mrs jennings mrs palmer joined their entreaties all seemed equally anxious avoid family party young ladies were obliged yield why should they ask us said marianne as soon as they were gone rent this cottage is said be low but we have it on very hard terms if we are dine at park whenever any one is staying either with them or with us they mean no less be civil kind us now said elinor by these frequent invitations than by those which we received from them few weeks ago alteration is not them if their parties are grown tedious dull we must look for change elsewhere chapter xx as miss dashwoods entered drawing room park next day at one door mrs palmer came running at other looking as good humoured merry as before she took them all most affectionately by hand expressed great delight seeing them again i am so glad see you said she seating herself between elinor marianne for it is so bad day i was afraid you might not come which would be shocking thing as we go away again tomorrow we must go for westons come us next week you know it was quite sudden thing our coming at all i knew nothing it till carriage was coming door then mr palmer asked me if i would go with him barton he is so droll he never tells me any thing i am so sorry we cannot stay longer however we shall meet again town very soon i hope they were obliged put end such expectation not go town cried mrs palmer with laugh i shall be quite disappointed if you do not i could get nicest house world for you next door ours hanover square you must come indeed i am sure i shall be very happy chaperon you at any time till i am confined if mrs dashwood should not like go into public they thanked her but were obliged resist all her entreaties oh my love cried mrs palmer her husband who just then entered room you must help me persuade miss dashwoods go town this winter her love made no answer after slightly bowing ladies began complaining weather how horrid all this is said he such weather makes every thing every body disgusting dullness is as much produced within doors as without by rain it makes one detest all one s acquaintance what devil does sir john mean by not having billiard room his house how few people know what comfort is sir john is as stupid as weather rest company soon dropt i am afraid miss marianne said sir john you have not been able take your usual walk allenham today marianne looked very grave said nothing oh don t be so sly before us said mrs palmer for we know all about it i assure you i admire your taste very much for i think he is extremely handsome we do not live great way from him country you know not above ten miles i dare say much nearer thirty said her husband ah well there is not much difference i never was at his house but they say it is sweet pretty place as vile spot as i ever saw my life said mr palmer marianne remained perfectly silent though her countenance betrayed her interest what was said is it very ugly continued mrs palmer then it must be some other place that is so pretty i suppose when they were seated dining room sir john observed with regret that they were only eight all together my dear said he his lady it is very provoking that we should be so few why did not you ask gilberts come us today did not i tell you sir john when you spoke me about it before that it could not be done they dined with us last you i sir john said mrs jennings should not stand upon such ceremony then you would be very ill bred cried mr palmer my love you contradict every body said his wife with her usual laugh do you know that you are quite rude i did not know i contradicted any body calling your mother ill bred ay you may abuse me as you please said good natured old lady you have taken charlotte off my hands cannot give her back again so there i have whip hand you charlotte laughed heartily think that her husband could not get rid her exultingly said she did not care how cross he was her as they must live together it was impossible for any one be more thoroughly good natured or more determined be happy than mrs palmer studied indifference insolence discontent her husband gave her no pain when he scolded or abused her she was highly diverted mr palmer is so droll said she whisper elinor he is always out humour elinor was not inclined after little observation give him credit for being so genuinely unaffectedly ill natured or ill bred as he wished appear his temper might perhaps be little soured by finding like many others his sex that through some unaccountable bias favour beauty he was husband very silly woman but she knew that this kind blunder was too common for any sensible man be lastingly hurt by it it was rather wish distinction she believed which produced his contemptuous treatment every body his general abuse every thing before him it was desire appearing superior other people motive was too common be wondered at but means however they might succeed by establishing his superiority ill breeding were not likely attach any one him except his wife oh my dear miss dashwood said mrs palmer soon afterwards i have got such favour ask you your sister will you come spend some time at cleveland this christmas now pray do come while westons are with us you cannot think how happy i shall be it will be quite delightful my love applying her husband don t you long have miss dashwoods come cleveland certainly he replied with sneer i came into devonshire with no other view there now said his lady you see mr palmer expects you so you cannot refuse come they both eagerly resolutely declined her invitation but indeed you must shall come i am sure you will like it all things westons will be with us it will be quite delightful you cannot think what sweet place cleveland is we are so gay now for mr palmer is always going about country canvassing against election so many people came dine with us that i never saw before it is quite charming but poor fellow it is very fatiguing him for he is forced make every body like him elinor could hardly keep her countenance as she assented hardship such obligation how charming it will be said charlotte when he is parliament won t it how i shall laugh it will be so ridiculous see all his letters directed him with m p but do you know he says he will never frank for me he declares he won t don t you mr palmer mr palmer took no notice her he cannot bear writing you know she continued he says it is quite shocking no said he i never said any thing so irrational don t palm all your abuses language upon me there now you see how droll he is this is always way with him sometimes he won t speak me for half day together then he comes out with something so droll all about any thing world she surprised elinor very much as they returned into drawing room by asking her whether she did not like mr palmer excessively certainly said elinor he seems very agreeable well i am so glad you do i thought you would he is so pleasant mr palmer is excessively pleased with you your sisters i can tell you you can t think how disappointed he will be if you don t come cleveland i can t imagine why you should object it elinor was again obliged decline her invitation by changing subject put stop her entreaties she thought it probable that as they lived same county mrs palmer might be able give some more particular account willoughby s general character than could be gathered from middletons partial acquaintance with him she was eager gain from any one such confirmation his merits as might remove possibility fear from marianne she began by inquiring if they saw much mr willoughby at cleveland whether they were intimately acquainted with him oh dear yes i know him extremely well replied mrs palmer not that i ever spoke him indeed but i have seen him for ever town somehow or other i never happened be staying at barton while he was at allenham mama saw him here once before but i was with my uncle at weymouth however i dare say we should have seen great deal him somersetshire if it had not happened very unluckily that we should never have been country together he is very little at combe i believe but if he were ever so much there i do not think mr palmer would visit him for he is opposition you know besides it is such way off i know why you inquire about him very well your sister is marry him i am monstrous glad it for then i shall have her for neighbour you know upon my word replied elinor you know much more matter than i do if you have any reason expect such match don t pretend deny it because you know it is what every body talks i assure you i heard it my way through town my dear mrs palmer upon my honour i did i met colonel brandon monday morning bond street just before we left town he told me it directly you surprise me very much colonel brandon tell you it surely you must be mistaken give such intelligence person who could not be interested it even if it were true is not what i should expect colonel brandon do but i do assure you it was so for all that i will tell you how it happened when we met him he turned back walked with us so we began talking my brother sister one thing another i said him so colonel there is new family come barton cottage i hear mama sends me word they are very pretty that one them is going be married mr willoughby combe magna is it true pray for course you must know as you have been devonshire so lately what did colonel say oh he did not say much but he looked as if he knew it be true so from that moment i set it down as certain it will be quite delightful i declare when is it take place mr brandon was very well i hope oh yes quite well so full your praises he did nothing but say fine things you i am flattered by his commendation he seems excellent man i think him uncommonly pleasing so do i he is such charming man that it is quite pity he should be so grave so dull mama says he was love with your sister too i assure you it was great compliment if he was for he hardly ever falls love with any body is mr willoughby much known your part somersetshire said elinor oh yes extremely well that is i do not believe many people are acquainted with him because combe magna is so far off but they all think him extremely agreeable i assure you nobody is more liked than mr willoughby wherever he goes so you may tell your sister she is monstrous lucky girl get him upon my honour not but that he is much more lucky getting her because she is so very handsome agreeable that nothing can be good enough for her however i don t think her hardly at all handsomer than you i assure you for i think you both excessively pretty so does mr palmer too i am sure though we could not get him own it last night mrs palmer s information respecting willoughby was not very material but any testimony his favour however small was pleasing her i am so glad we are got acquainted at last continued charlotte now i hope we shall always be great friends you can t think how much i longed see you it is so delightful that you should live at cottage nothing can be like it be sure i am so glad your sister is going be well married i hope you will be great deal at combe magna it is sweet place by all accounts you have been long acquainted with colonel brandon have not you yes great while ever since my sister married he was particular friend sir john s i believe she added low voice he would have been very glad have had me if he could sir john lady middleton wished it very much but mama did not think match good enough for me otherwise sir john would have mentioned it colonel we should have been married immediately did not colonel brandon know sir john s proposal your mother before it was made had he never owned his affection yourself oh no but if mama had not objected it i dare say he would have liked it all things he had not seen me then above twice for it was before i left school however i am much happier as i am mr palmer is kind man i like chapter xxi palmers returned cleveland next day two families at barton were again left entertain each other but this did not last long elinor had hardly got their last visitors out her head had hardly done wondering at charlotte s being so happy without cause at mr palmer s acting so simply with good abilities at strange unsuitableness which often existed between husband wife before sir john s mrs jennings s active zeal cause society procured her some other new acquaintance see observe morning s excursion exeter they had met with two young ladies whom mrs jennings had satisfaction discovering be her relations this was enough for sir john invite them directly park as soon as their present engagements at exeter were over their engagements at exeter instantly gave way before such invitation lady middleton was thrown into no little alarm on return sir john by hearing that she was very soon receive visit from two girls whom she had never seen her life whose elegance whose tolerable gentility even she could have no proof for assurances her husband mother on that subject went for nothing at all their being her relations too made it so much worse mrs jennings s attempts at consolation were therefore unfortunately founded when she advised her daughter not care about their being so fashionable because they were all cousins must put up with one another as it was impossible however now prevent their coming lady middleton resigned herself idea it with all philosophy well bred woman contenting herself with merely giving her husband gentle reprimand on subject five or six times every day young ladies arrived their appearance was by no means ungenteel or unfashionable their dress was very smart their manners very civil they were delighted with house raptures with furniture they happened be so doatingly fond children that lady middleton s good opinion was engaged their favour before they had been hour at park she declared them be very agreeable girls indeed which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration sir john s confidence his own judgment rose with this animated praise he set off directly for cottage tell miss dashwoods miss steeles arrival assure them their being sweetest girls world from such commendation as this however there was not much be learned elinor well knew that sweetest girls world were be met with every part england under every possible variation form face temper understanding sir john wanted whole family walk park directly look at his guests benevolent philanthropic man it was painful him even keep third cousin himself do come now said he pray come you must come i declare you shall come you can t think how you will like them lucy is monstrous pretty so good humoured agreeable children are all hanging about her already as if she was old acquaintance they both long see you all things for they have heard at exeter that you are most beautiful creatures world i have told them it is all very true great deal more you will be delighted with them i am sure they have brought whole coach full playthings for children how can you be so cross as not come why they are your cousins you know after fashion you are my cousins they are my wife s so you must be related but sir john could not prevail he could only obtain promise their calling at park within day or two then left them amazement at their indifference walk home boast anew their attractions miss steeles as he had been already boasting miss steeles them when their promised visit park consequent introduction these young ladies took place they found appearance eldest who was nearly thirty with very plain not sensible face nothing admire but other who was not more than two or three twenty they acknowledged considerable beauty her features were pretty she had sharp quick eye smartness air which though it did not give actual elegance or grace gave distinction her person their manners were particularly civil elinor soon allowed them credit for some kind sense when she saw with what constant judicious attention they were making themselves agreeable lady middleton with her children they were continual raptures extolling their beauty courting their notice humouring their whims such their time as could be spared from importunate demands which this politeness made on it was spent admiration whatever her ladyship was doing if she happened be doing any thing or taking patterns some elegant new dress which her appearance day before had thrown them into unceasing delight fortunately for those who pay their court through such foibles fond mother though pursuit praise for her children most rapacious human beings is likewise most credulous her demands are exorbitant but she will swallow any thing excessive affection endurance miss steeles towards her offspring were viewed therefore by lady middleton without smallest surprise or distrust she saw with maternal complacency all impertinent encroachments mischievous tricks which her cousins submitted she saw their sashes untied their hair pulled about their ears their work bags searched their knives scissors stolen away felt no doubt its being reciprocal enjoyment it suggested no other surprise than that elinor marianne should sit so composedly by without claiming share what was passing john is such spirits today said she on his taking miss steeles s pocket handkerchief throwing it out window he is full monkey tricks soon afterwards on second boy s violently pinching one same lady s fingers she fondly observed how playful william is here is my sweet little annamaria she added tenderly caressing little girl three years old who had not made noise for last two minutes she is always so gentle quiet never was there such quiet little thing but unfortunately bestowing these embraces pin her ladyship s head dress slightly scratching child s neck produced from this pattern gentleness such violent screams as could hardly be outdone by any creature professedly noisy mother s consternation was excessive but it could not surpass alarm miss steeles every thing was done by all three so critical emergency which affection could suggest as likely assuage agonies little sufferer she was seated her mother s lap covered with kisses her wound bathed with lavender water by one miss steeles who was on her knees attend her her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by other with such reward for her tears child was too wise cease crying she still screamed sobbed lustily kicked her two brothers for offering touch her all their united soothings were ineffectual till lady middleton luckily remembering that scene similar distress last week some apricot marmalade had been successfully applied for bruised temple same remedy was eagerly proposed for this unfortunate scratch slight intermission screams young lady on hearing it gave them reason hope that it would not be rejected she was carried out room therefore her mother s arms quest this medicine as two boys chose follow though earnestly entreated by their mother stay behind four young ladies were left quietness which room had not known for many hours poor little creatures said miss steele as soon as they were gone it might have been very sad accident yet i hardly know how cried marianne unless it had been under totally different circumstances but this is usual way heightening alarm where there is nothing be alarmed at reality what sweet woman lady middleton is said lucy steele marianne was silent it was impossible for her say what she did not feel however trivial occasion upon elinor therefore whole task telling lies when politeness required it always fell she did her best when thus called on by speaking lady middleton with more warmth than she felt though with far less than miss lucy sir john too cried elder sister what charming man he is here too miss dashwood s commendation being only simple just came without any eclat she merely observed that he was perfectly good humoured friendly what charming little family they have i never saw such fine children my life i declare i quite doat upon them already indeed i am always distractedly fond children i should guess so said elinor with smile from what i have witnessed this morning i have notion said lucy you think little middletons rather too much indulged perhaps they may be outside enough but it is so natural lady middleton for my part i love see children full life spirits i cannot bear them if they are tame quiet i confess replied elinor that while i am at barton park i never think tame quiet children with any abhorrence short pause succeeded this speech which was first broken by miss steele who seemed very much disposed for conversation who now said rather abruptly how do you like devonshire miss dashwood i suppose you were very sorry leave sussex some surprise at familiarity this question or at least manner which it was spoken elinor replied that she was norland is prodigious beautiful place is not it added miss steele we have heard sir john admire it excessively said lucy who seemed think some apology necessary for freedom her sister i think every one must admire it replied elinor who ever saw place though it is not be supposed that any one can estimate its beauties as we do had you great many smart beaux there i suppose you have not so many this part world for my part i think they are vast addition always but why should you think said lucy looking ashamed her sister that there are not as many genteel young men devonshire as sussex nay my dear i m sure i don t pretend say that there t i m sure there s vast many smart beaux exeter but you know how could i tell what smart beaux there might be about norland i was only afraid miss dashwoods might find it dull at barton if they had not so many as they used have but perhaps you young ladies may not care about beaux had as lief be without them as with them for my part i think they are vastly agreeable provided they dress smart behave civil but i can t bear see them dirty nasty now there s mr rose at exeter prodigious smart young man quite beau clerk mr simpson you know yet if you do but meet him morning he is not fit be seen i suppose your brother was quite beau miss dashwood before he married as he was so rich upon my word replied elinor i cannot tell you for i do not perfectly comprehend meaning word but this i can say that if he ever was beau before he married he is one still for there is not smallest alteration him oh dear one never thinks married men s being beaux they have something else do lord anne cried her sister you can talk nothing but beaux you will make miss dashwood believe you think nothing else then turn discourse she began admiring house furniture this specimen miss steeles was enough vulgar freedom folly eldest left her no recommendation as elinor was not blinded by beauty or shrewd look youngest her want real elegance artlessness she left house without any wish knowing them better not so miss steeles they came from exeter well provided with admiration for use sir john middleton his family all his relations no niggardly proportion was now dealt out his fair cousins whom they declared be most beautiful elegant accomplished agreeable girls they had ever beheld with whom they were particularly anxious be better acquainted be better acquainted therefore elinor soon found was their inevitable lot for as sir john was entirely on side miss steeles their party would be too strong for opposition that kind intimacy must be submitted which consists sitting hour or two together same room almost every day sir john could do no more but he did not know that any more was required be together was his opinion be intimate while his continual schemes for their meeting were effectual he had not doubt their being established friends do him justice he did every thing his power promote their unreserve by making miss steeles acquainted with whatever he knew or supposed his cousins situations most delicate particulars elinor had not seen them more than twice before eldest them wished her joy on her sister s having been so lucky as make conquest very smart beau since she came barton twill be fine thing have her married so young be sure said she i hear he is quite beau prodigious handsome i hope you may have as good luck yourself soon but perhaps you may have friend corner already elinor could not suppose that sir john would be more nice proclaiming his suspicions her regard for edward than he had been with respect marianne indeed it was rather his favourite joke two as being somewhat newer more conjectural since edward s visit they had never dined together without his drinking her best affections with so much significancy so many nods winks as excite general attention letter f had been likewise invariably brought forward found productive such countless jokes that its character as wittiest letter alphabet had been long established with elinor miss steeles as she expected had now all benefit these jokes eldest them they raised curiosity know name gentleman alluded which though often impertinently expressed was perfectly piece with her general inquisitiveness into concerns their family but sir john did not sport long with curiosity which he delighted raise for he had at least as much pleasure telling name as miss steele had hearing it his name is ferrars said he very audible whisper but pray do not tell it for it s great secret ferrars repeated miss steele mr ferrars is happy man is he what your sister law s brother miss dashwood very agreeable young man be sure i know him very well how can you say so anne cried lucy who generally made amendment all her sister s assertions though we have seen him once or twice at my uncle s it is rather too much pretend know him very well elinor heard all this with attention surprise who was this uncle where did he live how came they acquainted she wished very much have subject continued though she did not chuse join it herself but nothing more it was said for first time her life she thought mrs jennings deficient either curiosity after petty information or disposition communicate it manner which miss steele had spoken edward increased her curiosity for it struck her as being rather ill natured suggested suspicion that lady s knowing or fancying herself know something his disadvantage but her curiosity was unavailing for no farther notice was taken mr ferrars s name by miss steele when alluded or even openly mentioned by sir john chapter xxii marianne who had never much toleration for any thing like impertinence vulgarity inferiority parts or even difference taste from herself was at this time particularly ill disposed from state her spirits be pleased with miss steeles or encourage their advances invariable coldness her behaviour towards them which checked every endeavour at intimacy on their side elinor principally attributed that preference herself which soon became evident manners both but especially lucy who missed no opportunity engaging her conversation or striving improve their acquaintance by easy frank communication her sentiments lucy was naturally clever her remarks were often just amusing as companion for half hour elinor frequently found her agreeable but her powers had received no aid from education she was ignorant illiterate her deficiency all mental improvement her want information most common particulars could not be concealed from miss dashwood spite her constant endeavour appear advantage elinor saw pitied her for neglect abilities which education might have rendered so respectable but she saw with less tenderness feeling thorough want delicacy rectitude integrity mind which her attentions her assiduities her flatteries at park betrayed she could have no lasting satisfaction company person who joined insincerity with ignorance whose want instruction prevented their meeting conversation on terms equality whose conduct toward others made every show attention deference towards herself perfectly valueless you will think my question odd one i dare say said lucy her one day as they were walking together from park cottage but pray are you personally acquainted with your sister law s mother mrs ferrars elinor did think question very odd one her countenance expressed it as she answered that she had never seen mrs ferrars indeed replied lucy i wonder at that for i thought you must have seen her at norland sometimes then perhaps you cannot tell me what sort woman she is no returned elinor cautious giving her real opinion edward s mother not very desirous satisfying what seemed impertinent curiosity i know nothing her i am sure you think me very strange for enquiring about her such way said lucy eyeing elinor attentively as she spoke but perhaps there may be reasons i wish i might venture but however i hope you will do me justice believing that i do not mean be impertinent elinor made her civil reply they walked on for few minutes silence it was broken by lucy who renewed subject again by saying with some hesitation i cannot bear have you think me impertinently curious i am sure i would rather do any thing world than be thought so by person whose good opinion is so well worth having as yours i am sure i should not have smallest fear trusting you indeed i should be very glad your advice how manage such uncomfortable situation as i am but however there is no occasion trouble you i am sorry you do not happen know mrs ferrars i am sorry i do not said elinor great astonishment if it could be any use you know my opinion her but really i never understood that you were at all connected with that family therefore i am little surprised i confess at so serious inquiry into her character i dare say you are i am sure i do not at all wonder at it but if i dared tell you all you would not be so much surprised mrs ferrars is certainly nothing me at present but time may come how soon it will come must depend upon herself when we may be very intimately connected she looked down as she said this amiably bashful with only one side glance at her companion observe its effect on her good heavens cried elinor what do you mean are you acquainted with mr robert ferrars can you be she did not feel much delighted with idea such sister law no replied lucy not mr robert ferrars i never saw him my life but fixing her eyes upon elinor his eldest brother what felt elinor at that moment astonishment that would have been as painful as it was strong had not immediate disbelief assertion attended it she turned towards lucy silent amazement unable divine reason or object such declaration though her complexion varied she stood firm incredulity felt no danger hysterical fit or swoon you may well be surprised continued lucy for be sure you could have had no idea it before for i dare say he never dropped smallest hint it you or any your family because it was always meant be great secret i am sure has been faithfully kept so by me this hour not soul all my relations know it but anne i never should have mentioned it you if i had not felt greatest dependence world upon your secrecy i really thought my behaviour asking so many questions about mrs ferrars must seem so odd that it ought be explained i do not think mr ferrars can be displeased when he knows i have trusted you because i know he has highest opinion world all your family looks upon yourself other miss dashwoods quite as his own sisters she paused elinor for few moments remained silent her astonishment at what she heard was at first too great for words but at length forcing herself speak speak cautiously she said with calmness manner which tolerably well concealed her surprise solicitude may i ask if your engagement is long standing we have been engaged these four years four years yes elinor though greatly shocked still felt unable believe it i did not know said she that you were even acquainted till other day our acquaintance however is many years date he was under my uncle s care you know considerable while your uncle yes mr pratt did you never hear him talk mr pratt i think i have replied elinor with exertion spirits which increased with her increase emotion he was four years with my uncle who lives at longstaple near plymouth it was there our acquaintance begun for my sister me was often staying with my uncle it was there our engagement was formed though not till year after he had quitted as pupil but he was almost always with us afterwards i was very unwilling enter into it as you may imagine without knowledge approbation his mother but i was too young loved him too well be so prudent as i ought have been though you do not know him so well as me miss dashwood you must have seen enough him be sensible he is very capable making woman sincerely attached him certainly answered elinor without knowing what she said but after moment s reflection she added with revived security edward s honour love her companion s falsehood engaged mr edward ferrars i confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me that really i beg your pardon but surely there must be some mistake person or name we cannot mean same mr ferrars we can mean no other cried lucy smiling mr edward ferrars eldest son mrs ferrars park street brother your sister law mrs john dashwood is person i mean you must allow that i am not likely be deceived as name man on who all my happiness depends it is strange replied elinor most painful perplexity that i should never have heard him even mention your name no considering our situation it was not strange our first care has been keep matter secret you knew nothing me or my family therefore there could be no occasion for ever mentioning my name you as he was always particularly afraid his sister s suspecting any thing that was reason enough for his not mentioning it she was silent elinor s security sunk but her self command did not sink with it four years you have been engaged said she with firm voice yes heaven knows how much longer we may have wait poor edward it puts him quite out heart then taking small miniature from her pocket she added prevent possibility mistake be so good as look at this face it does not do him justice be sure but yet i think you cannot be deceived as person it was drew for i have had it above these three years she put it into her hands as she spoke when elinor saw painting whatever other doubts her fear too hasty decision or her wish detecting falsehood might suffer linger her mind she could have none its being edward s face she returned it almost instantly acknowledging likeness i have never been able continued lucy give him my picture return which i am very much vexed at for he has been always so anxious get it but i am determined set for it very first opportunity you are quite right replied elinor calmly they then proceeded few paces silence lucy spoke first i am sure said she i have no doubt world your faithfully keeping this secret because you must know what importance it is us not have it reach his mother for she would never approve it i dare say i shall have no fortune i fancy she is exceeding proud woman i certainly did not seek your confidence said elinor but you do me no more than justice imagining that i may be depended on your secret is safe with me but pardon me if i express some surprise at so unnecessary communication you must at least have felt that my being acquainted with it could not add its safety as she said this she looked earnestly at lucy hoping discover something her countenance perhaps falsehood greatest part what she had been saying but lucy s countenance suffered no change i was afraid you would think i was taking great liberty with you said she telling you all this i have not known you long be sure personally at least but i have known you all your family by description great while as soon as i saw you i felt almost as if you was old acquaintance besides present case i really thought some explanation was due you after my making such particular inquiries about edward s mother i am so unfortunate that i have not creature whose advice i can ask anne is only person that knows it she has no judgment at all indeed she does me great deal more harm than good for i am constant fear her betraying me she does not know how hold her tongue as you must perceive i am sure i was greatest fright world t other day when edward s name was mentioned by sir john lest she should out with it all you can t think how much i go through my mind from it altogether i only wonder that i am alive after what i have suffered for edward s sake these last four years every thing such suspense uncertainty seeing him so seldom we can hardly meet above twice year i am sure i wonder my heart is not quite broke here she took out her handkerchief but elinor did not feel very compassionate sometimes continued lucy after wiping her eyes i think whether it would not be better for us both break off matter entirely as she said this she looked directly at her companion but then at other times i have not resolution enough for it i cannot bear thoughts making him so miserable as i know very mention such thing would do on my own account too so dear as he is me i don t think i could be equal it what would you advise me do such case miss dashwood what would you do yourself pardon me replied elinor startled by question but i can give you no advice under such circumstances your own judgment must direct you be sure continued lucy after few minutes silence on both sides his mother must provide for him sometime or other but poor edward is so cast down by it did you not think him dreadful low spirited when he was at barton he was so miserable when he left us at longstaple go you that i was afraid you would think him quite ill did he come from your uncle s then when he visited us oh yes he had been staying fortnight with us did you think he came directly from town no replied elinor most feelingly sensible every fresh circumstance favour lucy s veracity i remember he told us that he had been staying fortnight with some friends near plymouth she remembered too her own surprise at time at his mentioning nothing farther those friends at his total silence with respect even their names did not you think him sadly out spirits repeated lucy we did indeed particularly so when he first arrived i begged him exert himself for fear you should suspect what was matter but it made him so melancholy not being able stay more than fortnight with us seeing me so much affected poor fellow i am afraid it is just same with him now for he writes wretched spirits i heard from him just before i left exeter taking letter from her pocket carelessly showing direction elinor you know his hand i dare say charming one it is but that is not written so well as usual he was tired i dare say for he had just filled sheet me as full as possible elinor saw that it was his hand she could doubt no longer this picture she had allowed herself believe might have been accidentally obtained it might not have been edward s gift but correspondence between them by letter could subsist only under positive engagement could be authorised by nothing else for few moments she was almost overcome her heart sunk within her she could hardly stand but exertion was indispensably necessary she struggled so resolutely against oppression her feelings that her success was speedy for time complete writing each other said lucy returning letter into her pocket is only comfort we have such long separations yes i have one other comfort his picture but poor edward has not even that if he had but my picture he says he should be easy i gave him lock my hair set ring when he was at longstaple last that was some comfort him he said but not equal picture perhaps you might notice ring when you saw him i did said elinor with composure voice under which was concealed emotion distress beyond any thing she had ever felt before she was mortified shocked confounded fortunately for her they had now reached cottage conversation could be continued no farther after sitting with them few minutes miss steeles returned park elinor was then at liberty think be wretched end first volume chapter xxiii however small elinor s general dependence on lucy s veracity might be it was impossible for her on serious reflection suspect it present case where no temptation could be answerable folly inventing falsehood such description what lucy had asserted be true therefore elinor could not dared not longer doubt supported as it was too on every side by such probabilities proofs contradicted by nothing but her own wishes their opportunity acquaintance house mr pratt was foundation for rest at once indisputable alarming edward s visit near plymouth his melancholy state mind his dissatisfaction at his own prospects his uncertain behaviour towards herself intimate knowledge miss steeles as norland their family connections which had often surprised her picture letter ring formed altogether such body evidence as overcame every fear condemning him unfairly established as fact which no partiality could set aside his ill treatment herself her resentment such behaviour her indignation at having been its dupe for short time made her feel only for herself but other ideas other considerations soon arose had edward been intentionally deceiving her had he feigned regard for her which he did not feel was his engagement lucy engagement heart no whatever it might once have been she could not believe it such at present his affection was all her own she could not be deceived that her mother sisters fanny all had been conscious his regard for her at norland it was not illusion her own vanity he certainly loved her what softener heart was this persuasion how much could it not tempt her forgive he had been blamable highly blamable remaining at norland after he first felt her influence over him be more than it ought be that he could not be defended but if he had injured her how much more had he injured himself if her case were pitiable his was hopeless his imprudence had made her miserable for while but it seemed have deprived himself all chance ever being otherwise she might time regain tranquillity but he what had he look forward could he ever be tolerably happy with lucy steele could he were his affection for herself out question with his integrity his delicacy well informed mind be satisfied with wife like her illiterate artful selfish youthful infatuation nineteen would naturally blind him every thing but her beauty good nature but four succeeding years years which if rationally spent give such improvement understanding must have opened his eyes her defects education while same period time spent on her side inferior society more frivolous pursuits had perhaps robbed her that simplicity which might once have given interesting character her beauty if supposition his seeking marry herself his difficulties from his mother had seemed great how much greater were they now likely be when object his engagement was undoubtedly inferior connections probably inferior fortune herself these difficulties indeed with heart so alienated from lucy might not press very hard upon his patience but melancholy was state person by whom expectation family opposition unkindness could be felt as relief as these considerations occurred her painful succession she wept for him more than for herself supported by conviction having done nothing merit her present unhappiness consoled by belief that edward had done nothing forfeit her esteem she thought she could even now under first smart heavy blow command herself enough guard every suspicion truth from her mother sisters so well was she able answer her own expectations that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after she had first suffered extinction all her dearest hopes no one would have supposed from appearance sisters that elinor was mourning secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever from object her love that marianne was internally dwelling on perfections man whose whole heart she felt thoroughly possessed whom she expected see every carriage which drove near their house necessity concealing from her mother marianne what had been entrusted confidence herself though it obliged her unceasing exertion was no aggravation elinor s distress on contrary it was relief her be spared communication what would give such affliction them be saved likewise from hearing that condemnation edward which would probably flow from excess their partial affection for herself which was more than she felt equal support from their counsel or their conversation she knew she could receive no assistance their tenderness sorrow must add her distress while her self command would neither receive encouragement from their example nor from their praise she was stronger alone her own good sense so well supported her that her firmness was as unshaken her appearance cheerfulness as invariable as with regrets so poignant so fresh it was possible for them be much as she had suffered from her first conversation with lucy on subject she soon felt earnest wish renewing it this for more reasons than one she wanted hear many particulars their engagement repeated again she wanted more clearly understand what lucy really felt for edward whether there were any sincerity her declaration tender regard for him she particularly wanted convince lucy by her readiness enter on matter again her calmness conversing on it that she was no otherwise interested it than as friend which she very much feared her involuntary agitation their morning discourse must have left at least doubtful that lucy was disposed be jealous her appeared very probable it was plain that edward had always spoken highly her praise not merely from lucy s assertion but from her venturing trust her on so short personal acquaintance with secret so confessedly evidently important even sir john s joking intelligence must have had some weight but indeed while elinor remained so well assured within herself being really beloved by edward it required no other consideration probabilities make it natural that lucy should be jealous that she was so her very confidence was proof what other reason for disclosure affair could there be but that elinor might be informed by it lucy s superior claims on edward be taught avoid him future she had little difficulty understanding thus much her rival s intentions while she was firmly resolved act by her as every principle honour honesty directed combat her own affection for edward see him as little as possible she could not deny herself comfort endeavouring convince lucy that her heart was unwounded as she could now have nothing more painful hear on subject than had already been told she did not mistrust her own ability going through repetition particulars with composure but it was not immediately that opportunity doing so could be commanded though lucy was as well disposed as herself take advantage any that occurred for weather was not often fine enough allow their joining walk where they might most easily separate themselves from others though they met at least every other evening either at park or cottage chiefly at former they could not be supposed meet for sake conversation such thought would never enter either sir john or lady middleton s head therefore very little leisure was ever given for general chat none at all for particular discourse they met for sake eating drinking laughing together playing at cards or consequences or any other game that was sufficiently noisy one or two meetings this kind had taken place without affording elinor any chance engaging lucy private when sir john called at cottage one morning beg name charity that they would all dine with lady middleton that day as he was obliged attend club at exeter she would otherwise be quite alone except her mother two miss steeles elinor who foresaw fairer opening for point she had view such party as this was likely be more at liberty among themselves under tranquil well bred direction lady middleton than when her husband united them together one noisy purpose immediately accepted invitation margaret with her mother s permission was equally compliant marianne though always unwilling join any their parties was persuaded by her mother who could not bear have her seclude herself from any chance amusement go likewise young ladies went lady middleton was happily preserved from frightful solitude which had threatened her insipidity meeting was exactly such as elinor had expected it produced not one novelty thought or expression nothing could be less interesting than whole their discourse both dining parlour drawing room latter children accompanied them while they remained there she was too well convinced impossibility engaging lucy s attention attempt it they quitted it only with removal tea things card table was then placed elinor began wonder at herself for having ever entertained hope finding time for conversation at park they all rose up preparation for round game i am glad said lady middleton lucy you are not going finish poor little annamaria s basket this evening for i am sure it must hurt your eyes work filigree by candlelight we will make dear little love some amends for her disappointment morrow then i hope she will not much mind it this hint was enough lucy recollected herself instantly replied indeed you are very much mistaken lady middleton i am only waiting know whether you can make your party without me or i should have been at my filigree already i would not disappoint little angel for all world if you want me at card table now i am resolved finish basket after supper you are very good i hope it won t hurt your eyes will you ring bell for some working candles my poor little girl would be sadly disappointed i know if basket was not finished tomorrow for though i told her it certainly would not i am sure she depends upon having it done lucy directly drew her work table near her reseated herself with alacrity cheerfulness which seemed infer that she could taste no greater delight than making filigree basket for spoilt child lady middleton proposed rubber casino others no one made any objection but marianne who with her usual inattention forms general civility exclaimed your ladyship will have goodness excuse me you know i detest cards i shall go piano forte i have not touched it since it was tuned without farther ceremony she turned away walked instrument lady middleton looked as if she thanked heaven that she had never made so rude speech marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know ma am said elinor endeavouring smooth away offence i do not much wonder at it for it is very best toned piano forte i ever heard remaining five were now draw their cards perhaps continued elinor if i should happen cut out i may be some use miss lucy steele rolling her papers for her there is so much still be done basket that it must be impossible i think for her labour singly finish it this evening i should like work exceedingly if she would allow me share it indeed i shall be very much obliged you for your help cried lucy for i find there is more be done it than i thought there was it would be shocking thing disappoint dear annamaria after all oh that would be terrible indeed said miss steele dear little soul how i do love her you are very kind said lady middleton elinor as you really like work perhaps you will be as well pleased not cut till another rubber or will you take your chance now elinor joyfully profited by first these proposals thus by little that address which marianne could never condescend practise gained her own end pleased lady middleton at same time lucy made room for her with ready attention two fair rivals were thus seated side by side at same table with utmost harmony engaged forwarding same work pianoforte at which marianne wrapped up her own music her own thoughts had by this time forgotten that any body was room besides herself was luckily so near them that miss dashwood now judged she might safely under shelter its noise introduce interesting subject without any risk being heard at card table chapter xxiv firm though cautious tone elinor thus began i should be undeserving confidence you have honoured me with if i felt no desire for its continuance or no farther curiosity on its subject i will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again thank you cried lucy warmly for breaking ice you have set my heart at ease by it for i was somehow or other afraid i had offended you by what i told you that monday offended me how could you suppose so believe me elinor spoke it with truest sincerity nothing could be farther from my intention than give you such idea could you have motive for trust that was not honourable flattering me yet i do assure you replied lucy her little sharp eyes full meaning there seemed me be coldness displeasure your manner that made me quite uncomfortable i felt sure that you was angry with me have been quarrelling with myself ever since for having took such liberty as trouble you with my affairs but i am very glad find it was only my own fancy that you really do not blame me if you knew what consolation it was me relieve my heart speaking you what i am always thinking every moment my life your compassion would make you overlook every thing else i am sure indeed i can easily believe that it was very great relief you acknowledge your situation me be assured that you shall never have reason repent it your case is very unfortunate one you seem me be surrounded with difficulties you will have need all your mutual affection support you under them mr ferrars i believe is entirely dependent on his mother he has only two thousand pounds his own it would be madness marry upon that though for my own part i could give up every prospect more without sigh i have been always used very small income could struggle with any poverty for him but i love him too well be selfish means robbing him perhaps all that his mother might give him if he married please her we must wait it may be for many years with almost every other man world it would be alarming prospect but edward s affection constancy nothing can deprive me i know that conviction must be every thing you he is undoubtedly supported by same trust your s if strength your reciprocal attachment had failed as between many people under many circumstances it naturally would during four years engagement your situation would have been pitiable indeed lucy here looked up but elinor was careful guarding her countenance from every expression that could give her words suspicious tendency edward s love for me said lucy has been pretty well put test by our long very long absence since we were first engaged it has stood trial so well that i should be unpardonable doubt it now i can safely say that he has never gave me one moment s alarm on that account from first elinor hardly knew whether smile or sigh at this assertion lucy went on i am rather jealous temper too by nature from our different situations life from his being so much more world than me our continual separation i was enough inclined for suspicion have found out truth instant if there had been slightest alteration his behaviour me when we met or any lowness spirits that i could not account for or if he had talked more one lady than another or seemed any respect less happy at longstaple than he used be i do not mean say that i am particularly observant or quick sighted general but such case i am sure i could not be deceived all this thought elinor is very pretty but it can impose upon neither us but what said she after short silence are your views or have you none but that waiting for mrs ferrars s death which is melancholy shocking extremity is her son determined submit this all tediousness many years suspense which it may involve you rather than run risk her displeasure for while by owning truth if we could be certain that it would be only for while but mrs ferrars is very headstrong proud woman her first fit anger upon hearing it would very likely secure every thing robert idea that for edward s sake frightens away all my inclination for hasty measures for your own sake too or you are carrying your disinterestedness beyond reason lucy looked at elinor again was silent do you know mr robert ferrars asked elinor not at all i never saw him but i fancy he is very unlike his brother silly great coxcomb great coxcomb repeated miss steele whose ear had caught those words by sudden pause marianne s music oh they are talking their favourite beaux i dare say no sister cried lucy you are mistaken there our favourite beaux are not great coxcombs i can answer for it that miss dashwood s is not said mrs jennings laughing heartily for he is one modestest prettiest behaved young men i ever saw but as for lucy she is such sly little creature there is no finding out who she likes oh cried miss steele looking significantly round at them i dare say lucy s beau is quite as modest pretty behaved as miss dashwood s elinor blushed spite herself lucy bit her lip looked angrily at her sister mutual silence took place for some time lucy first put end it by saying lower tone though marianne was then giving them powerful protection very magnificent concerto i will honestly tell you one scheme which has lately come into my head for bringing matters bear indeed i am bound let you into secret for you are party concerned i dare say you have seen enough edward know that he would prefer church every other profession now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as he can then through your interest which i am sure you would be kind enough use out friendship for him i hope out some regard me your brother might be persuaded give him norland living which i understand is very good one present incumbent not likely live great while that would be enough for us marry upon we might trust time chance for rest i should always be happy replied elinor show any mark my esteem friendship for mr ferrars but do you not perceive that my interest on such occasion would be perfectly unnecessary he is brother mrs john dashwood that must be recommendation enough her husband but mrs john dashwood would not much approve edward s going into orders then i rather suspect that my interest would do very little they were again silent for many minutes at length lucy exclaimed with deep sigh i believe it would be wisest way put end business at once by dissolving engagement we seem so beset with difficulties on every side that though it would make us miserable for time we should be happier perhaps end but you will not give me your advice miss dashwood no answered elinor with smile which concealed very agitated feelings on such subject i certainly will not you know very well that my opinion would have no weight with you unless it were on side your wishes indeed you wrong me replied lucy with great solemnity i know nobody whose judgment i think so highly as i do yours i do really believe that if you was say me i advise you by all means put end your engagement with edward ferrars it will be more for happiness both you i should resolve upon doing it immediately elinor blushed for insincerity edward s future wife replied this compliment would effectually frighten me from giving any opinion on subject had i formed one it raises my influence much too high power dividing two people so tenderly attached is too much for indifferent person tis because you are indifferent person said lucy with some pique laying particular stress on those words that your judgment might justly have such weight with me if you could be supposed be biased any respect by your own feelings your opinion would not be worth having elinor thought it wisest make no answer this lest they might provoke each other unsuitable increase ease unreserve was even partly determined never mention subject again another pause therefore many minutes duration succeeded this speech lucy was still first end it shall you be town this winter miss dashwood said she with all her accustomary complacency certainly not i am sorry for that returned other while her eyes brightened at information it would have gave me such pleasure meet you there but i dare say you will go for all that be sure your brother sister will ask you come them it will not be my power accept their invitation if they do how unlucky that is i had quite depended upon meeting you there anne me are go latter end january some relations who have been wanting us visit them these several years but i only go for sake seeing edward he will be there february otherwise london would have no charms for me i have not spirits for it elinor was soon called card table by conclusion first rubber confidential discourse two ladies was therefore at end which both them submitted without any reluctance for nothing had been said on either side make them dislike each other less than they had done before elinor sat down card table with melancholy persuasion that edward was not only without affection for person who was be his wife but that he had not even chance being tolerably happy marriage which sincere affection on her side would have given for self interest alone could induce woman keep man engagement which she seemed so thoroughly aware that he was weary from this time subject was never revived by elinor when entered on by lucy who seldom missed opportunity introducing it was particularly careful inform her confidante her happiness whenever she received letter from edward it was treated by former with calmness caution dismissed as soon as civility would allow for she felt such conversations be indulgence which lucy did not deserve which were dangerous herself visit miss steeles at barton park was lengthened far beyond what first invitation implied their favour increased they could not be spared sir john would not hear their going spite their numerous long arranged engagements exeter spite absolute necessity returning fulfill them immediately which was full force at end every week they were prevailed on stay nearly two months at park assist due celebration that festival which requires more than ordinary share private balls large dinners proclaim its importance chapter xxv though mrs jennings was habit spending large portion year at houses her children friends she was not without settled habitation her own since death her husband who had traded with success less elegant part town she had resided every winter house one streets near portman square towards this home she began on approach january turn her thoughts thither she one day abruptly very unexpectedly by them asked elder misses dashwood accompany her elinor without observing varying complexion her sister animated look which spoke no indifference plan immediately gave grateful but absolute denial for both which she believed herself be speaking their united inclinations reason alleged was their determined resolution not leaving their mother at that time year mrs jennings received refusal with some surprise repeated her invitation immediately oh lord i am sure your mother can spare you very well i do beg you will favour me with your company for i ve quite set my heart upon it don t fancy that you will be any inconvenience me for i shan t put myself at all out my way for you it will only be sending betty by coach i hope i can afford that we three shall be able go very well my chaise when we are town if you do not like go wherever i do well good you may always go with one my daughters i am sure your mother will not object it for i have had such good luck getting my own children off my hands that she will think me very fit person have charge you if i don t get one you at least well married before i have done with you it shall not be my fault i shall speak good word for you all young men you may depend upon it i have notion said sir john that miss marianne would not object such scheme if her elder sister would come into it it is very hard indeed that she should not have little pleasure because miss dashwood does not wish it so i would advise you two set off for town when you are tired barton without saying word miss dashwood about it nay cried mrs jennings i am sure i shall be monstrous glad miss marianne s company whether miss dashwood will go or not only more merrier say i i thought it would be more comfortable for them be together because if they got tired me they might talk one another laugh at my odd ways behind my back but one or other if not both them i must have lord bless me how do you think i can live poking by myself i who have been always used till this winter have charlotte with me come miss marianne let us strike hands upon bargain if miss dashwood will change her mind by bye why so much better i thank you ma am sincerely thank you said marianne with warmth your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever it would give me such happiness yes almost greatest happiness i am capable be able accept it but my mother my dearest kindest mother i feel justice what elinor has urged if she were be made less happy less comfortable by our absence oh no nothing should tempt me leave her it should not must not be struggle mrs jennings repeated her assurance that mrs dashwood could spare them perfectly well elinor who now understood her sister saw what indifference almost every thing else she was carried by her eagerness be with willoughby again made no farther direct opposition plan merely referred it her mother s decision from whom however she scarcely expected receive any support her endeavour prevent visit which she could not approve for marianne which on her own account she had particular reasons avoid whatever marianne was desirous her mother would be eager promote she could not expect influence latter cautiousness conduct affair respecting which she had never been able inspire her with distrust she dared not explain motive her own disinclination for going london that marianne fastidious as she was thoroughly acquainted with mrs jennings manners invariably disgusted by them should overlook every inconvenience that kind should disregard whatever must be most wounding her irritable feelings her pursuit one object was such proof so strong so full importance that object her as elinor spite all that had passed was not prepared witness on being informed invitation mrs dashwood persuaded that such excursion would be productive much amusement both her daughters perceiving through all her affectionate attention herself how much heart marianne was it would not hear their declining offer upon her account insisted on their both accepting it directly then began foresee with her usual cheerfulness variety advantages that would accrue them all from this separation i am delighted with plan she cried it is exactly what i could wish margaret i shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves when you middletons are gone we shall go on so quietly happily together with our books our music you will find margaret so improved when you come back again i have little plan alteration for your bedrooms too which may now be performed without any inconvenience any one it is very right that you should go town i would have every young woman your condition life acquainted with manners amusements london you will be under care motherly good sort woman whose kindness you i can have no doubt all probability you will see your brother whatever may be his faults or faults his wife when i consider whose son he is i cannot bear have you so wholly estranged from each other though with your usual anxiety for our happiness said elinor you have been obviating every impediment present scheme which occurred you there is still one objection which my opinion cannot be so easily removed marianne s countenance sunk what said mrs dashwood is my dear prudent elinor going suggest what formidable obstacle is she now bring forward do not let me hear word about expense it my objection is this though i think very well mrs jennings s heart she is not woman whose society can afford us pleasure or whose protection will give us consequence that is very true replied her mother but her society separately from that other people you will scarcely have any thing at all you will almost always appear public with lady middleton if elinor is frightened away by her dislike mrs jennings said marianne at least it need not prevent my accepting her invitation i have no such scruples i am sure i could put up with every unpleasantness that kind with very little effort elinor could not help smiling at this display indifference towards manners person whom she had often had difficulty persuading marianne behave with tolerable politeness resolved within herself that if her sister persisted going she would go likewise as she did not think it proper that marianne should be left sole guidance her own judgment or that mrs jennings should be abandoned mercy marianne for all comfort her domestic hours this determination she was more easily reconciled by recollecting that edward ferrars by lucy s account was not be town before february that their visit without any unreasonable abridgement might be previously finished i will have you both go said mrs dashwood these objections are nonsensical you will have much pleasure being london especially being together if elinor would ever condescend anticipate enjoyment she would foresee it there from variety sources she would perhaps expect some from improving her acquaintance with her sister law s family elinor had often wished for opportunity attempting weaken her mother s dependence on attachment edward herself that shock might be less when whole truth were revealed now on this attack though almost hopeless success she forced herself begin her design by saying as calmly as she could i like edward ferrars very much shall always be glad see him but as rest family it is matter perfect indifference me whether i am ever known them or not mrs dashwood smiled said nothing marianne lifted up her eyes astonishment elinor conjectured that she might as well have held her tongue after very little farther discourse it was finally settled that invitation should be fully accepted mrs jennings received information with great deal joy many assurances kindness care nor was it matter pleasure merely her sir john was delighted for man whose prevailing anxiety was dread being alone acquisition two number inhabitants london was something even lady middleton took trouble being delighted which was putting herself rather out her way as for miss steeles especially lucy they had never been so happy their lives as this intelligence made them elinor submitted arrangement which counteracted her wishes with less reluctance than she had expected feel with regard herself it was now matter unconcern whether she went town or not when she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with plan her sister exhilarated by it look voice manner restored all her usual animation elevated more than her usual gaiety she could not be dissatisfied with cause would hardly allow herself distrust consequence marianne s joy was almost degree beyond happiness so great was perturbation her spirits her impatience be gone her unwillingness quit her mother was her only restorative calmness at moment parting her grief on that score was excessive her mother s affliction was hardly less elinor was only one three who seemed consider separation as any thing short eternal their departure took place first week january middletons were follow about week miss steeles kept their station at park were quit it only with rest family chapter xxvi elinor could not find herself carriage with mrs jennings beginning journey london under her protection as her guest without wondering at her own situation so short had their acquaintance with that lady been so wholly unsuited were they age disposition so many had been her objections against such measure only few days before but these objections had all with that happy ardour youth which marianne her mother equally shared been overcome or overlooked elinor spite every occasional doubt willoughby s constancy could not witness rapture delightful expectation which filled whole soul beamed eyes marianne without feeling how blank was her own prospect how cheerless her own state mind comparison how gladly she would engage solicitude marianne s situation have same animating object view same possibility hope short very short time however must now decide what willoughby s intentions were all probability he was already town marianne s eagerness be gone declared her dependence on finding him there elinor was resolved not only upon gaining every new light as his character which her own observation or intelligence others could give her but likewise upon watching his behaviour her sister with such zealous attention as ascertain what he was what he meant before many meetings had taken place should result her observations be unfavourable she was determined at all events open eyes her sister should it be otherwise her exertions would be different nature she must then learn avoid every selfish comparison banish every regret which might lessen her satisfaction happiness marianne they were three days on their journey marianne s behaviour as they travelled was happy specimen what future complaisance companionableness mrs jennings might be expected be she sat silence almost all way wrapt her own meditations scarcely ever voluntarily speaking except when any object picturesque beauty within their view drew from her exclamation delight exclusively addressed her sister atone for this conduct therefore elinor took immediate possession post civility which she had assigned herself behaved with greatest attention mrs jennings talked with her laughed with her listened her whenever she could mrs jennings on her side treated them both with all possible kindness was solicitous on every occasion for their ease enjoyment only disturbed that she could not make them choose their own dinners at inn nor extort confession their preferring salmon cod or boiled fowls veal cutlets they reached town by three o clock third day glad be released after such journey from confinement carriage ready enjoy all luxury good fire house was handsome handsomely fitted up young ladies were immediately put possession very comfortable apartment it had formerly been charlotte s over mantelpiece still hung landscape coloured silks her performance proof her having spent seven years at great school town some effect as dinner was not be ready less than two hours from their arrival elinor determined employ interval writing her mother sat down for that purpose few moments marianne did same i am writing home marianne said elinor had not you better defer your letter for day or two i am not going write my mother replied marianne hastily as if wishing avoid any farther inquiry elinor said no more it immediately struck her that she must then be writing willoughby conclusion which as instantly followed was that however mysteriously they might wish conduct affair they must be engaged this conviction though not entirely satisfactory gave her pleasure she continued her letter with greater alacrity marianne s was finished very few minutes length it could be no more than note it was then folded up sealed directed with eager rapidity elinor thought she could distinguish large w direction no sooner was it complete than marianne ringing bell requested footman who answered it get that letter conveyed for her two penny post this decided matter at once her spirits still continued very high but there was flutter them which prevented their giving much pleasure her sister this agitation increased as evening drew on she could scarcely eat any dinner when they afterwards returned drawing room seemed anxiously listening sound every carriage it was great satisfaction elinor that mrs jennings by being much engaged her own room could see little what was passing tea things were brought already had marianne been disappointed more than once by rap at neighbouring door when loud one was suddenly heard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house elinor felt secure its announcing willoughby s approach marianne starting up moved towards door every thing was silent this could not be borne many seconds she opened door advanced few steps towards stairs after listening half minute returned into room all agitation which conviction having heard him would naturally produce ecstasy her feelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming oh elinor it is willoughby indeed it is seemed almost ready throw herself into his arms when colonel brandon appeared it was too great shock be borne with calmness she immediately left room elinor was disappointed too but at same time her regard for colonel brandon ensured his welcome with her she felt particularly hurt that man so partial her sister should perceive that she experienced nothing but grief disappointment seeing him she instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him that he even observed marianne as she quitted room with such astonishment concern as hardly left him recollection what civility demanded towards herself is your sister ill said he elinor answered some distress that she was then talked head aches low spirits over fatigues every thing which she could decently attribute her sister s behaviour he heard her with most earnest attention but seeming recollect himself said no more on subject began directly speak his pleasure at seeing them london making usual inquiries about their journey friends they had left behind this calm kind way with very little interest on either side they continued talk both them out spirits thoughts both engaged elsewhere elinor wished very much ask whether willoughby were then town but she was afraid giving him pain by any enquiry after his rival at length by way saying something she asked if he had been london ever since she had seen him last yes he replied with some embarrassment almost ever since i have been once or twice at delaford for few days but it has never been my power return barton this manner which it was said immediately brought back her remembrance all circumstances his quitting that place with uneasiness suspicions they had caused mrs jennings she was fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on subject than she had ever felt mrs jennings soon came oh colonel said she with her usual noisy cheerfulness i am monstrous glad see you sorry i could not come before beg your pardon but i have been forced look about me little settle my matters for it is long while since i have been at home you know one has always world little odd things do after one has been away for any time then i have had cartwright settle with lord i have been as busy as bee ever since dinner but pray colonel how came you conjure out that i should be town today i had pleasure hearing it at mr palmer s where i have been dining oh you did well how do they all do at their house how does charlotte do i warrant you she is fine size by this time mrs palmer appeared quite well i am commissioned tell you that you will certainly see her morrow ay be sure i thought as much well colonel i have brought two young ladies with me you see that is you see but one them now but there is another somewhere your friend miss marianne too which you will not be sorry hear i do not know what you mr willoughby will do between you about her ay it is fine thing be young handsome well i was young once but i never was very handsome worse luck for me however i got very good husband i don t know what greatest beauty can do more ah poor man he has been dead these eight years better but colonel where have you been since we parted how does your business go on come come let s have no secrets among friends he replied with his accustomary mildness all her inquiries but without satisfying her any elinor now began make tea marianne was obliged appear again after her entrance colonel brandon became more thoughtful silent than he had been before mrs jennings could not prevail on him stay long no other visitor appeared that evening ladies were unanimous agreeing go early bed marianne rose next morning with recovered spirits happy looks disappointment evening before seemed forgotten expectation what was happen that day they had not long finished their breakfast before mrs palmer s barouche stopped at door few minutes she came laughing into room so delighted see them all that it was hard say whether she received most pleasure from meeting her mother or miss dashwoods again so surprised at their coming town though it was what she had rather expected all along so angry at their accepting her mother s invitation after having declined her own though at same time she would never have forgiven them if they had not come mr palmer will be so happy see you said she what do you think he said when he heard your coming with mama i forget what it was now but it was something so droll after hour or two spent what her mother called comfortable chat or other words every variety inquiry concerning all their acquaintance on mrs jennings s side laughter without cause on mrs palmer s it was proposed by latter that they should all accompany her some shops where she had business that morning which mrs jennings elinor readily consented as having likewise some purchases make themselves marianne though declining it at first was induced go likewise wherever they went she was evidently always on watch bond street especially where much their business lay her eyes were constant inquiry whatever shop party were engaged her mind was equally abstracted from every thing actually before them from all that interested occupied others restless dissatisfied every where her sister could never obtain her opinion any article purchase however it might equally concern them both she received no pleasure from anything was only impatient be at home again could with difficulty govern her vexation at tediousness mrs palmer whose eye was caught by every thing pretty expensive or new who was wild buy all could determine on none dawdled away her time rapture indecision it was late morning before they returned home no sooner had they entered house than marianne flew eagerly up stairs when elinor followed she found her turning from table with sorrowful countenance which declared that no willoughby had been there has no letter been left here for me since we went out said she footman who then entered with parcels she was answered negative are you quite sure it she replied are you certain that no servant no porter has left any letter or note man replied that none had how very odd said she low disappointed voice as she turned away window how odd indeed repeated elinor within herself regarding her sister with uneasiness if she had not known him be town she would not have written him as she did she would have written combe magna if he is town how odd that he should neither come nor write oh my dear mother you must be wrong permitting engagement between daughter so young man so little known be carried on so doubtful so mysterious manner i long inquire how will my interference be borne she determined after some consideration that if appearances continued many days longer as unpleasant as they now were she would represent strongest manner her mother necessity some serious enquiry into affair mrs palmer two elderly ladies mrs jennings s intimate acquaintance whom she had met invited morning dined with them former left them soon after tea fulfill her evening engagements elinor was obliged assist making whist table for others marianne was no use on these occasions as she would never learn game but though her time was therefore at her own disposal evening was by no means more productive pleasure her than elinor for it was spent all anxiety expectation pain disappointment she sometimes endeavoured for few minutes read but book was soon thrown aside she returned more interesting employment walking backwards forwards across room pausing for moment whenever she came window hopes distinguishing long expected rap chapter xxvii if this open weather holds much longer said mrs jennings when they met at breakfast following morning sir john will not like leaving barton next week tis sad thing for sportsmen lose day s pleasure poor souls i always pity them when they do they seem take it so much heart that is true cried marianne cheerful voice walking window as she spoke examine day i had not thought that this weather will keep many sportsmen country it was lucky recollection all her good spirits were restored by it it is charming weather for them indeed she continued as she sat down breakfast table with happy countenance how much they must enjoy it but with little return anxiety it cannot be expected last long at this time year after such series rain we shall certainly have very little more it frosts will soon set all probability with severity another day or two perhaps this extreme mildness can hardly last longer nay perhaps it may freeze tonight at any rate said elinor wishing prevent mrs jennings from seeing her sister s thoughts as clearly as she did i dare say we shall have sir john lady middleton town by end next week ay my dear i ll warrant you we do mary always has her own way now silently conjectured elinor she will write combe by this day s post but if she did letter was written sent away with privacy which eluded all her watchfulness ascertain fact whatever truth it might be far as elinor was from feeling thorough contentment about it yet while she saw marianne spirits she could not be very uncomfortable herself marianne was spirits happy mildness weather still happier her expectation frost morning was chiefly spent leaving cards at houses mrs jennings s acquaintance inform them her being town marianne was all time busy observing direction wind watching variations sky imagining alteration air don t you find it colder than it was morning elinor there seems me very decided difference i can hardly keep my hands warm even my muff it was not so yesterday i think clouds seem parting too sun will be out moment we shall have clear afternoon elinor was alternately diverted pained but marianne persevered saw every night brightness fire every morning appearance atmosphere certain symptoms approaching frost miss dashwoods had no greater reason be dissatisfied with mrs jennings s style living set acquaintance than with her behaviour themselves which was invariably kind every thing her household arrangements was conducted on most liberal plan excepting few old city friends whom lady middleton s regret she had never dropped she visited no one whom introduction could at all discompose feelings her young companions pleased find herself more comfortably situated that particular than she had expected elinor was very willing compound for want much real enjoyment from any their evening parties which whether at home or abroad formed only for cards could have little amuse her colonel brandon who had general invitation house was with them almost every day he came look at marianne talk elinor who often derived more satisfaction from conversing with him than from any other daily occurrence but who saw at same time with much concern his continued regard for her sister she feared it was strengthening regard it grieved her see earnestness with which he often watched marianne his spirits were certainly worse than when at barton about week after their arrival it became certain that willoughby was also arrived his card was on table when they came from morning s drive good god cried marianne he has been here while we were out elinor rejoiced be assured his being london now ventured say depend upon it he will call again tomorrow but marianne seemed hardly hear her on mrs jennings s entrance escaped with precious card this event while it raised spirits elinor restored those her sister all more than all their former agitation from this moment her mind was never quiet expectation seeing him every hour day made her unfit for any thing she insisted on being left behind next morning when others went out elinor s thoughts were full what might be passing berkeley street during their absence but moment s glance at her sister when they returned was enough inform her that willoughby had paid no second visit there note was just then brought laid on table for me cried marianne stepping hastily forward no ma am for my mistress but marianne not convinced took it instantly up it is indeed for mrs jennings how provoking you are expecting letter then said elinor unable be longer silent yes little not much after short pause you have no confidence me marianne nay elinor this reproach from you you who have confidence no one me returned elinor some confusion indeed marianne i have nothing tell nor i answered marianne with energy our situations then are alike we have neither us any thing tell you because you do not communicate i because i conceal nothing elinor distressed by this charge reserve herself which she was not at liberty do away knew not how under such circumstances press for greater openness marianne mrs jennings soon appeared note being given her she read it aloud it was from lady middleton announcing their arrival conduit street night before requesting company her mother cousins following evening business on sir john s part violent cold on her own prevented their calling berkeley street invitation was accepted but when hour appointment drew near necessary as it was common civility mrs jennings that they should both attend her on such visit elinor had some difficulty persuading her sister go for still she had seen nothing willoughby therefore was not more indisposed for amusement abroad than unwilling run risk his calling again her absence elinor found when evening was over that disposition is not materially altered by change abode for although scarcely settled town sir john had contrived collect around him nearly twenty young people amuse them with ball this was affair however which lady middleton did not approve country unpremeditated dance was very allowable but london where reputation elegance was more important less easily attained it was risking too much for gratification few girls have it known that lady middleton had given small dance eight or nine couple with two violins mere side board collation mr mrs palmer were party from former whom they had not seen before since their arrival town as he was careful avoid appearance any attention his mother law therefore never came near her they received no mark recognition on their entrance he looked at them slightly without seeming know who they were merely nodded mrs jennings from other side room marianne gave one glance round apartment as she entered it was enough he was not there she sat down equally ill disposed receive or communicate pleasure after they had been assembled about hour mr palmer sauntered towards miss dashwoods express his surprise on seeing them town though colonel brandon had been first informed their arrival at his house he had himself said something very droll on hearing that they were come i thought you were both devonshire said he did you replied elinor when do you go back again i do not know thus ended their discourse never had marianne been so unwilling dance her life as she was that evening never so much fatigued by exercise she complained it as they returned berkeley street aye aye said mrs jennings we know reason all that very well if certain person who shall be nameless had been there you would not have been bit tired say truth it was not very pretty him not give you meeting when he was invited invited cried marianne so my daughter middleton told me for it seems sir john met him somewhere street this morning marianne said no more but looked exceedingly hurt impatient this situation be doing something that might lead her sister s relief elinor resolved write next morning her mother hoped by awakening her fears for health marianne procure those inquiries which had been so long delayed she was still more eagerly bent on this measure by perceiving after breakfast on morrow that marianne was again writing willoughby for she could not suppose it be any other person about middle day mrs jennings went out by herself on business elinor began her letter directly while marianne too restless for employment too anxious for conversation walked from one window other or sat down by fire melancholy meditation elinor was very earnest her application her mother relating all that had passed her suspicions willoughby s inconstancy urging her by every plea duty affection demand from marianne account her real situation with respect him her letter was scarcely finished when rap foretold visitor colonel brandon was announced marianne who had seen him from window who hated company any kind left room before he entered it he looked more than usually grave though expressing satisfaction at finding miss dashwood alone as if he had somewhat particular tell her sat for some time without saying word elinor persuaded that he had some communication make which her sister was concerned impatiently expected its opening it was not first time her feeling same kind conviction for more than once before beginning with observation your sister looks unwell day or your sister seems out spirits he had appeared on point either disclosing or inquiring something particular about her after pause several minutes their silence was broken by his asking her voice some agitation when he was congratulate her on acquisition brother elinor was not prepared for such question having no answer ready was obliged adopt simple common expedient asking what he meant he tried smile as he replied your sister s engagement mr willoughby is very generally known it cannot be generally known returned elinor for her own family do not know it he looked surprised said i beg your pardon i am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent but i had not supposed any secrecy intended as they openly correspond their marriage is universally talked how can that be by whom can you have heard it mentioned by many by some whom you know nothing by others with whom you are most intimate mrs jennings mrs palmer middletons but still i might not have believed it for where mind is perhaps rather unwilling be convinced it will always find something support its doubts if i had not when servant let me today accidentally seen letter his hand directed mr willoughby your sister s writing i came inquire but i was convinced before i could ask question is every thing finally settled is it impossible but i have no right i could have no chance succeeding excuse me miss dashwood i believe i have been wrong saying so much but i hardly know what do on your prudence i have strongest dependence tell me that it is all absolutely resolved on that any attempt that short concealment if concealment be possible is all that remains these words which conveyed elinor direct avowal his love for her sister affected her very much she was not immediately able say anything even when her spirits were recovered she debated for short time on answer it would be most proper give real state things between willoughby her sister was so little known herself that endeavouring explain it she might be as liable say too much as too little yet as she was convinced that marianne s affection for willoughby could leave no hope colonel brandon s success whatever event that affection might be at same time wished shield her conduct from censure she thought it most prudent kind after some consideration say more than she really knew or believed she acknowledged therefore that though she had never been informed by themselves terms on which they stood with each other their mutual affection she had no doubt their correspondence she was not astonished hear he listened her with silent attention on her ceasing speak rose directly from his seat after saying voice emotion your sister i wish all imaginable happiness willoughby that he may endeavour deserve her took leave went away elinor derived no comfortable feelings from this conversation lessen uneasiness her mind on other points she was left on contrary with melancholy impression colonel brandon s unhappiness was prevented even from wishing it removed by her anxiety for very event that must confirm it chapter xxviii nothing occurred during next three or four days make elinor regret what she had done applying her mother for willoughby neither came nor wrote they were engaged about end that time attend lady middleton party from which mrs jennings was kept away by indisposition her youngest daughter for this party marianne wholly dispirited careless her appearance seeming equally indifferent whether she went or staid prepared without one look hope or one expression pleasure she sat by drawing room fire after tea till moment lady middleton s arrival without once stirring from her seat or altering her attitude lost her own thoughts insensible her sister s presence when at last they were told that lady middleton waited for them at door she started as if she had forgotten that any one was expected they arrived due time at place destination as soon as string carriages before them would allow alighted ascended stairs heard their names announced from one landing place another audible voice entered room splendidly lit up quite full company insufferably hot when they had paid their tribute politeness by curtsying lady house they were permitted mingle crowd take their share heat inconvenience which their arrival must necessarily add after some time spent saying little or doing less lady middleton sat down cassino as marianne was not spirits for moving about she elinor luckily succeeding chairs placed themselves at no great distance from table they had not remained this manner long before elinor perceived willoughby standing within few yards them earnest conversation with very fashionable looking young woman she soon caught his eye he immediately bowed but without attempting speak her or approach marianne though he could not but see her then continued his discourse with same lady elinor turned involuntarily marianne see whether it could be unobserved by her at that moment she first perceived him her whole countenance glowing with sudden delight she would have moved towards him instantly had not her sister caught hold her good heavens she exclaimed he is there he is there oh why does he not look at me why cannot i speak him pray pray be composed cried elinor do not betray what you feel every body present perhaps he has not observed you yet this however was more than she could believe herself be composed at such moment was not only beyond reach marianne it was beyond her wish she sat agony impatience which affected every feature at last he turned round again regarded them both she started up pronouncing his name tone affection held out her hand him he approached addressing himself rather elinor than marianne as if wishing avoid her eye determined not observe her attitude inquired hurried manner after mrs dashwood asked how long they had been town elinor was robbed all presence mind by such address was unable say word but feelings her sister were instantly expressed her face was crimsoned over she exclaimed voice greatest emotion good god willoughby what is meaning this have you not received my letters will you not shake hands with me he could not then avoid it but her touch seemed painful him he held her hand only for moment during all this time he was evidently struggling for composure elinor watched his countenance saw its expression becoming more tranquil after moment s pause he spoke with calmness i did myself honour calling berkeley street last tuesday very much regretted that i was not fortunate enough find yourselves mrs jennings at home my card was not lost i hope but have you not received my notes cried marianne wildest anxiety here is some mistake i am sure some dreadful mistake what can be meaning it tell me willoughby for heaven s sake tell me what is matter he made no reply his complexion changed all his embarrassment returned but as if on catching eye young lady with whom he had been previously talking he felt necessity instant exertion he recovered himself again after saying yes i had pleasure receiving information your arrival town which you were so good as send me turned hastily away with slight bow joined his friend marianne now looking dreadfully white unable stand sunk into her chair elinor expecting every moment see her faint tried screen her from observation others while reviving her with lavender water go him elinor she cried as soon as she could speak force him come me tell him i must see him again must speak him instantly i cannot rest i shall not have moment s peace till this is explained some dreadful misapprehension or other oh go him this moment how can that be done no my dearest marianne you must wait this is not place for explanations wait only till tomorrow with difficulty however could she prevent her from following him herself persuade her check her agitation wait at least with appearance composure till she might speak him with more privacy more effect was impossible for marianne continued incessantly give way low voice misery her feelings by exclamations wretchedness short time elinor saw willoughby quit room by door towards staircase telling marianne that he was gone urged impossibility speaking him again that evening as fresh argument for her be calm she instantly begged her sister would entreat lady middleton take them home as she was too miserable stay minute longer lady middleton though middle rubber on being informed that marianne was unwell was too polite object for moment her wish going away making over her cards friend they departed as soon as carriage could be found scarcely word was spoken during their return berkeley street marianne was silent agony too much oppressed even for tears but as mrs jennings was luckily not come home they could go directly their own room where hartshorn restored her little herself she was soon undressed bed as she seemed desirous being alone her sister then left her while she waited return mrs jennings had leisure enough for thinking over past that some kind engagement had subsisted between willoughby marianne she could not doubt that willoughby was weary it seemed equally clear for however marianne might still feed her own wishes she could not attribute such behaviour mistake or misapprehension any kind nothing but thorough change sentiment could account for it her indignation would have been still stronger than it was had she not witnessed that embarrassment which seemed speak consciousness his own misconduct prevented her from believing him so unprincipled as have been sporting with affections her sister from first without any design that would bear investigation absence might have weakened his regard convenience might have determined him overcome it but that such regard had formerly existed she could not bring herself doubt as for marianne on pangs which so unhappy meeting must already have given her on those still more severe which might await her its probable consequence she could not reflect without deepest concern her own situation gained comparison for while she could esteem edward as much as ever however they might be divided future her mind might be always supported but every circumstance that could embitter such evil seemed uniting heighten misery marianne final separation from willoughby immediate irreconcilable rupture with him chapter xxix before housemaid had lit their fire next day or sun gained any power over cold gloomy morning january marianne only half dressed was kneeling against one window seats for sake all little light she could command from it writing as fast as continual flow tears would permit her this situation elinor roused from sleep by her agitation sobs first perceived her after observing her for few moments with silent anxiety said tone most considerate gentleness marianne may i ask no elinor she replied ask nothing you will soon know all sort desperate calmness with which this was said lasted no longer than while she spoke was immediately followed by return same excessive affliction it was some minutes before she could go on with her letter frequent bursts grief which still obliged her at intervals withhold her pen were proofs enough her feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing for last time willoughby elinor paid her every quiet unobtrusive attention her power she would have tried sooth tranquilize her still more had not marianne entreated her with all eagerness most nervous irritability not speak her for world such circumstances it was better for both that they should not be long together restless state marianne s mind not only prevented her from remaining room moment after she was dressed but requiring at once solitude continual change place made her wander about house till breakfast time avoiding sight every body at breakfast she neither ate nor attempted eat any thing elinor s attention was then all employed not urging her not pitying her nor appearing regard her but endeavouring engage mrs jennings s notice entirely herself as this was favourite meal with mrs jennings it lasted considerable time they were just setting themselves after it round common working table when letter was delivered marianne which she eagerly caught from servant turning death like paleness instantly ran out room elinor who saw as plainly by this as if she had seen direction that it must come from willoughby felt immediately such sickness at heart as made her hardly able hold up her head sat such general tremour as made her fear it impossible escape mrs jennings s notice that good lady however saw only that marianne had received letter from willoughby which appeared her very good joke which she treated accordingly by hoping with laugh that she would find it her liking elinor s distress she was too busily employed measuring lengths worsted for her rug see any thing at all calmly continuing her talk as soon as marianne disappeared she said upon my word i never saw young woman so desperately love my life my girls were nothing her yet they used be foolish enough but as for miss marianne she is quite altered creature i hope from bottom my heart he won t keep her waiting much longer for it is quite grievous see her look so ill forlorn pray when are they be married elinor though never less disposed speak than at that moment obliged herself answer such attack as this therefore trying smile replied have you really ma am talked yourself into persuasion my sister s being engaged mr willoughby i thought it had been only joke but so serious question seems imply more i must beg therefore that you will not deceive yourself any longer i do assure you that nothing would surprise me more than hear their being going be married for shame for shame miss dashwood how can you talk so don t we all know that it must be match that they were over head ears love with each other from first moment they met did not i see them together devonshire every day all day long did not i know that your sister came town with me on purpose buy wedding clothes come come this won t do because you are so sly about it yourself you think nobody else has any senses but it is no such thing i can tell you for it has been known all over town this ever so long i tell every body it so does charlotte indeed ma am said elinor very seriously you are mistaken indeed you are doing very unkind thing spreading report you will find that you have though you will not believe me now mrs jennings laughed again but elinor had not spirits say more eager at all events know what willoughby had written hurried away their room where on opening door she saw marianne stretched on bed almost choked by grief one letter her hand two or three others lying by her elinor drew near but without saying word seating herself on bed took her hand kissed her affectionately several times then gave way burst tears which at first was scarcely less violent than marianne s latter though unable speak seemed feel all tenderness this behaviour after some time thus spent joint affliction she put all letters into elinor s hands then covering her face with her handkerchief almost screamed with agony elinor who knew that such grief shocking as it was witness it must have its course watched by her till this excess suffering had somewhat spent itself then turning eagerly willoughby s letter read as follows bond street january my dear madam i have just had honour receiving your letter for which i beg return my sincere acknowledgments i am much concerned find there was anything my behaviour last night that did not meet your approbation though i am quite at loss discover what point i could be so unfortunate as offend you i entreat your forgiveness what i can assure you have been perfectly unintentional i shall never reflect on my former acquaintance with your family devonshire without most grateful pleasure flatter myself it will not be broken by any mistake or misapprehension my actions my esteem for your whole family is very sincere but if i have been so unfortunate as give rise belief more than i felt or meant express i shall reproach myself for not having been more guarded my professions that esteem that i should ever have meant more you will allow be impossible when you understand that my affections have been long engaged elsewhere it will not be many weeks i believe before this engagement is fulfilled it is with great regret that i obey your commands returning letters with which i have been honoured from you lock hair which you so obligingly bestowed on me i am dear madam your most obedient humble servant john willoughby with what indignation such letter as this must be read by miss dashwood may be imagined though aware before she began it that it must bring confession his inconstancy confirm their separation for ever she was not aware that such language could be suffered announce it nor could she have supposed willoughby capable departing so far from appearance every honourable delicate feeling so far from common decorum gentleman as send letter so impudently cruel letter which instead bringing with his desire release any professions regret acknowledged no breach faith denied all peculiar affection whatever letter which every line was insult which proclaimed its writer be deep hardened villainy she paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment then read it again again but every perusal only served increase her abhorrence man so bitter were her feelings against him that she dared not trust herself speak lest she might wound marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement not as loss her any possible good but as escape from worst most irremediable all evils connection for life with unprincipled man as deliverance most real blessing most important her earnest meditations on contents letter on depravity that mind which could dictate it probably on very different mind very different person who had no other connection whatever with affair than what her heart gave him with every thing that passed elinor forgot immediate distress her sister forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread so entirely forgot how long she had been room that when on hearing carriage drive up door she went window see who could be coming so unreasonably early she was all astonishment perceive mrs jennings s chariot which she knew had not been ordered till one determined not quit marianne though hopeless contributing at present her ease she hurried away excuse herself from attending mrs jennings on account her sister being indisposed mrs jennings with thoroughly good humoured concern for its cause admitted excuse most readily elinor after seeing her safe off returned marianne whom she found attempting rise from bed whom she reached just time prevent her from falling on floor faint giddy from long want proper rest food for it was many days since she had any appetite many nights since she had really slept now when her mind was no longer supported by fever suspense consequence all this was felt aching head weakened stomach general nervous faintness glass wine which elinor procured for her directly made her more comfortable she was at last able express some sense her kindness by saying poor elinor how unhappy i make you i only wish replied her sister there were any thing i could do which might be comfort you this as every thing else would have been was too much for marianne who could only exclaim anguish her heart oh elinor i am miserable indeed before her voice was entirely lost sobs elinor could no longer witness this torrent unresisted grief silence exert yourself dear marianne she cried if you would not kill yourself all who love you think your mother think her misery while you suffer for her sake you must exert yourself i cannot i cannot cried marianne leave me leave me if i distress you leave me hate me forget me but do not torture me so oh how easy for those who have no sorrow their own talk exertion happy happy elinor you cannot have idea what i suffer do you call me happy marianne ah if you knew can you believe me be so while i see you so wretched forgive me forgive me throwing her arms round her sister s neck i know you feel for me i know what heart you have but yet you are you must be happy edward loves you what oh what can do away such happiness as that many many circumstances said elinor solemnly no no no cried marianne wildly he loves you only you you can have no grief i can have no pleasure while i see you this state you will never see me otherwise mine is misery which nothing can do away you must not talk so marianne have you no comforts no friends is your loss such as leaves no opening for consolation much as you suffer now think what you would have suffered if discovery his character had been delayed later period if your engagement had been carried on for months months as it might have been before he chose put end it every additional day unhappy confidence on your side would have made blow more dreadful engagement cried marianne there has been no engagement no engagement no he is not so unworthy as you believe him he has broken no faith with me but he told you that he loved you yes no never absolutely it was every day implied but never professedly declared sometimes i thought it had been but it never was yet you wrote him yes could that be wrong after all that had passed but i cannot talk elinor said no more turning again three letters which now raised much stronger curiosity than before directly ran over contents all first which was what her sister had sent him on their arrival town was this effect berkeley street january how surprised you will be willoughby on receiving this i think you will feel something more than surprise when you know that i am town opportunity coming hither though with mrs jennings was temptation we could not resist i wish you may receive this time come here night but i will not depend on it at any rate i shall expect you morrow for present adieu m d her second note which had been written on morning after dance at middletons was these words i cannot express my disappointment having missed you day before yesterday nor my astonishment at not having received any answer note which i sent you above week ago i have been expecting hear from you still more see you every hour day pray call again as soon as possible explain reason my having expected this vain you had better come earlier another time because we are generally out by one we were last night at lady middleton s where there was dance i have been told that you were asked be party but could it be so you must be very much altered indeed since we parted if that could be case you not there but i will not suppose this possible i hope very soon receive your personal assurance its being otherwise m d contents her last note him were these what am i imagine willoughby by your behaviour last night again i demand explanation it i was prepared meet you with pleasure which our separation naturally produced with familiarity which our intimacy at barton appeared me justify i was repulsed indeed i have passed wretched night endeavouring excuse conduct which can scarcely be called less than insulting but though i have not yet been able form any reasonable apology for your behaviour i am perfectly ready hear your justification it you have perhaps been misinformed or purposely deceived something concerning me which may have lowered me your opinion tell me what it is explain grounds on which you acted i shall be satisfied being able satisfy you it would grieve me indeed be obliged think ill you but if i am do it if i am learn that you are not what we have hitherto believed you that your regard for us all was insincere that your behaviour me was intended only deceive let it be told as soon as possible my feelings are at present state dreadful indecision i wish acquit you but certainty on either side will be ease what i now suffer if your sentiments are no longer what they were you will return my notes lock my hair which is your possession m d that such letters so full affection confidence could have been so answered elinor for willoughby s sake would have been unwilling believe but her condemnation him did not blind her impropriety their having been written at all she was silently grieving over imprudence which had hazarded such unsolicited proofs tenderness not warranted by anything preceding most severely condemned by event when marianne perceiving that she had finished letters observed her that they contained nothing but what any one would have written same situation i felt myself she added be as solemnly engaged him as if strictest legal covenant had bound us each other i can believe it said elinor but unfortunately he did not feel same he did feel same elinor for weeks weeks he felt it i know he did whatever may have changed him now nothing but blackest art employed against me can have done it i was once as dear him as my own soul could wish this lock hair which now he can so readily give up was begged me with most earnest supplication had you seen his look his manner had you heard his voice at that moment have you forgot last evening our being together at barton morning that we parted too when he told me that it might be many weeks before we met again his distress can i ever forget his distress for moment or two she could say no more but when this emotion had passed away she added firmer tone elinor i have been cruelly used but not by willoughby dearest marianne who but himself by whom can he have been instigated by all world rather than by his own heart i could rather believe every creature my acquaintance leagued together ruin me his opinion than believe his nature capable such cruelty this woman whom he writes whoever she be or any one short but your own dear self mama edward may have been so barbarous bely me beyond you three is there creature world whom i would not rather suspect evil than willoughby whose heart i know so well elinor would not contend only replied whoever may have been so detestably your enemy let them be cheated their malignant triumph my dear sister by seeing how nobly consciousness your own innocence good intentions supports your spirits it is reasonable laudable pride which resists such malevolence no no cried marianne misery such as mine has no pride i care not who knows that i am wretched triumph seeing me so may be open all world elinor elinor they who suffer little may be proud independent as they like may resist insult or return mortification but i cannot i must feel i must be wretched they are welcome enjoy consciousness it that can but for my mother s sake mine i would do more than for my own but appear happy when i am so miserable oh who can require it again they were both silent elinor was employed walking thoughtfully from fire window from window fire without knowing that she received warmth from one or discerning objects through other marianne seated at foot bed with her head leaning against one its posts again took up willoughby s letter after shuddering over every sentence exclaimed it is too much oh willoughby willoughby could this be yours cruel cruel nothing can acquit you elinor nothing can whatever he might have heard against me ought he not have suspended his belief ought he not have told me it have given me power clearing myself lock hair repeating it from letter which you so obligingly bestowed on me that is unpardonable willoughby where was your heart when you wrote those words oh barbarously insolent elinor can he be justified no marianne no possible way yet this woman who knows what her art may have been how long it may have been premeditated how deeply contrived by her who is she who can she be whom did i ever hear him talk as young attractive among his female acquaintance oh no one no one he talked me only myself another pause ensued marianne was greatly agitated it ended thus elinor i must go home i must go comfort mama can not we be gone morrow morrow marianne yes why should i stay here i came only for willoughby s sake now who cares for me who regards me it would be impossible go morrow we owe mrs jennings much more than civility civility commonest kind must prevent such hasty removal as that well then another day or two perhaps but i cannot stay here long i cannot stay endure questions remarks all these people middletons palmers how am i bear their pity pity such woman as lady middleton oh what would he say that elinor advised her lie down again for moment she did so but no attitude could give her ease restless pain mind body she moved from one posture another till growing more more hysterical her sister could with difficulty keep her on bed at all for some time was fearful being constrained call for assistance some lavender drops however which she was at length persuaded take were use from that time till mrs jennings returned she continued on bed quiet motionless chapter xxx mrs jennings came immediately their room on her return without waiting have her request admittance answered opened door walked with look real concern how do you do my dear said she voice great compassion marianne who turned away her face without attempting answer how is she miss dashwood poor thing she looks very bad no wonder ay it is but too true he is be married very soon good for nothing fellow i have no patience with him mrs taylor told me it half hour ago she was told it by particular friend miss grey herself else i am sure i should not have believed it i was almost ready sink as it was well said i all i can say is that if this be true he has used young lady my acquaintance abominably ill i wish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out so i shall always say my dear you may depend on it i have no notion men s going on this way if ever i meet him again i will give him such dressing as he has not had this many day but there is one comfort my dear miss marianne he is not only young man world worth having with your pretty face you will never want admirers well poor thing i won t disturb her any longer for she had better have her cry out at once have done with parrys sandersons luckily are coming tonight you know that will amuse her she then went away walking on tiptoe out room as if she supposed her young friend s affliction could be increased by noise marianne surprise her sister determined on dining with them elinor even advised her against it but no she would go down she could bear it very well bustle about her would be less elinor pleased have her governed for moment by such motive though believing it hardly possible that she could sit out dinner said no more adjusting her dress for her as well as she could while marianne still remained on bed was ready assist her into dining room as soon as they were summoned it when there though looking most wretchedly she ate more was calmer than her sister had expected had she tried speak or had she been conscious half mrs jennings s well meant but ill judged attentions her this calmness could not have been maintained but not syllable escaped her lips abstraction her thoughts preserved her ignorance every thing that was passing before her elinor who did justice mrs jennings s kindness though its effusions were often distressing sometimes almost ridiculous made her those acknowledgments returned her those civilities which her sister could not make or return for herself their good friend saw that marianne was unhappy felt that every thing was due her which might make her at all less so she treated her therefore with all indulgent fondness parent towards favourite child on last day its holidays marianne was have best place by fire was be tempted eat by every delicacy house be amused by relation all news day had not elinor sad countenance her sister seen check all mirth she could have been entertained by mrs jennings s endeavours cure disappointment love by variety sweetmeats olives good fire as soon however as consciousness all this was forced by continual repetition on marianne she could stay no longer with hasty exclamation misery sign her sister not follow her she directly got up hurried out room poor soul cried mrs jennings as soon as she was gone how it grieves me see her i declare if she is not gone away without finishing her wine dried cherries too lord nothing seems do her any good i am sure if i knew any thing she would like i would send all over town for it well it is oddest thing me that man should use such pretty girl so ill but when there is plenty money on one side next none on other lord bless you they care no more about such things lady then miss grey i think you called her is very rich fifty thousand pounds my dear did you ever see her smart stylish girl they say but not handsome i remember her aunt very well biddy henshawe she married very wealthy man but family are all rich together fifty thousand pounds by all accounts it won t come before it s wanted for they say he is all pieces no wonder dashing about with his curricle hunters well it don t signify talking but when young man be who he will comes makes love pretty girl promises marriage he has no business fly off from his word only because he grows poor richer girl is ready have him why don t he such case sell his horses let his house turn off his servants make thorough reform at once i warrant you miss marianne would have been ready wait till matters came round but that won t do now days nothing way pleasure can ever be given up by young men this age do you know what kind girl miss grey is is she said be amiable i never heard any harm her indeed i hardly ever heard her mentioned except that mrs taylor did say this morning that one day miss walker hinted her that she believed mr mrs ellison would not be sorry have miss grey married for she mrs ellison could never agree who are ellisons her guardians my dear but now she is age may choose for herself pretty choice she has made what now after pausing moment your poor sister is gone her own room i suppose moan by herself is there nothing one can get comfort her poor dear it seems quite cruel let her be alone well by by we shall have few friends that will amuse her little what shall we play at she hates whist i know but is there no round game she cares for dear ma am this kindness is quite unnecessary marianne i dare say will not leave her room again this evening i shall persuade her if i can go early bed for i am sure she wants rest aye i believe that will be best for her let her name her own supper go bed lord no wonder she has been looking so bad so cast down this last week or two for this matter i suppose has been hanging over her head as long as that so letter that came today finished it poor soul i am sure if i had had notion it i would not have joked her about it for all my money but then you know how should i guess such thing i made sure its being nothing but common love letter you know young people like be laughed at about them lord how concerned sir john my daughters will be when they hear it if i had my senses about me i might have called conduit street my way home told them it but i shall see them tomorrow it would be unnecessary i am sure for you caution mrs palmer sir john against ever naming mr willoughby or making slightest allusion what has passed before my sister their own good nature must point out them real cruelty appearing know any thing about it when she is present less that may ever be said myself on subject more my feelings will be spared as you my dear madam will easily believe oh lord yes that i do indeed it must be terrible for you hear it talked as for your sister i am sure i would not mention word about it her for world you saw i did not all dinner time no more would sir john nor my daughters for they are all very thoughtful considerate especially if i give them hint as i certainly will for my part i think less that is said about such things better sooner tis blown over forgot what good does talking ever do you know this affair it can only do harm more so perhaps than many cases similar kind for it has been attended by circumstances which for sake every one concerned it make it unfit become public conversation i must do this justice mr willoughby he has broken no positive engagement with my sister law my dear don t pretend defend him no positive engagement indeed after taking her all over allenham house fixing on very rooms they were live hereafter elinor for her sister s sake could not press subject farther she hoped it was not required her for willoughby s since though marianne might lose much he could gain very little by enforcement real truth after short silence on both sides mrs jennings with all her natural hilarity burst forth again well my dear tis true saying about ill wind for it will be all better for colonel brandon he will have her at last aye that he will mind me now if they t married by mid summer lord how he ll chuckle over this news i hope he will come tonight it will be all one better match for your sister two thousand year without debt or drawback except little love child indeed aye i had forgot her but she may be prenticed out at small cost then what does it signify delaford is nice place i can tell you exactly what i call nice old fashioned place full comforts conveniences quite shut with great garden walls that are covered with best fruit trees country such mulberry tree one corner lord how charlotte i did stuff only time we were there then there is dove cote some delightful stew ponds very pretty canal every thing short that one could wish for moreover it is close church only quarter mile from turnpike road so tis never dull for if you only go sit up old yew arbour behind house you may see all carriages that pass along oh tis nice place butcher hard by village parsonage house within stone s throw my fancy thousand times prettier than barton park where they are forced send three miles for their meat have not neighbour nearer than your mother well i shall spirit up colonel as soon as i can one shoulder mutton you know drives another down if we can but put willoughby out her head ay if we can do that ma am said elinor we shall do very well with or without colonel brandon then rising she went away join marianne whom she found as she expected her own room leaning silent misery over small remains fire which till elinor s entrance had been her only light you had better leave me was all notice that her sister received from her i will leave you said elinor if you will go bed but this from momentary perverseness impatient suffering she at first refused do her sister s earnest though gentle persuasion however soon softened her compliance elinor saw her lay her aching head on pillow as she hoped way get some quiet rest before she left her drawing room whither she then repaired she was soon joined by mrs jennings with wine glass full something her hand my dear said she entering i have just recollected that i have some finest old constantia wine house that ever was tasted so i have brought glass it for your sister my poor husband how fond he was it whenever he had touch his old colicky gout he said it did him more good than any thing else world do take it your sister dear ma am replied elinor smiling at difference complaints for which it was recommended how good you are but i have just left marianne bed i hope almost asleep as i think nothing will be so much service her as rest if you will give me leave i will drink wine myself mrs jennings though regretting that she had not been five minutes earlier was satisfied with compromise elinor as she swallowed chief it reflected that though its effects on colicky gout were at present little importance her its healing powers on disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried on herself as on her sister colonel brandon came while party were at tea by his manner looking round room for marianne elinor immediately fancied that he neither expected nor wished see her there short that he was already aware what occasioned her absence mrs jennings was not struck by same thought for soon after his entrance she walked across room tea table where elinor presided whispered colonel looks as grave as ever you see he knows nothing it do tell him my dear he shortly afterwards drew chair close hers with look which perfectly assured her his good information inquired after her sister marianne is not well said she she has been indisposed all day we have persuaded her go bed perhaps then he hesitatingly replied what i heard this morning may be there may be more truth it than i could believe possible at first what did you hear that gentleman whom i had reason think short that man whom i knew be engaged but how shall i tell you if you know it already as surely you must i may be spared you mean answered elinor with forced calmness mr willoughby s marriage with miss grey yes we do know it all this seems have been day general elucidation for this very morning first unfolded it us mr willoughby is unfathomable where did you hear it stationer s shop pall mall where i had business two ladies were waiting for their carriage one them was giving other account intended match voice so little attempting concealment that it was impossible for me not hear all name willoughby john willoughby frequently repeated first caught my attention what followed was positive assertion that every thing was now finally settled respecting his marriage with miss grey it was no longer be secret it would take place even within few weeks with many particulars preparations other matters one thing especially i remember because it served identify man still more as soon as ceremony was over they were go combe magna his seat somersetshire my astonishment but it would be impossible describe what i felt communicative lady i learnt on inquiry for i stayed shop till they were gone was mrs ellison that as i have been since informed is name miss grey s guardian it is but have you likewise heard that miss grey has fifty thousand pounds that if any thing we may find explanation it may be so but willoughby is capable at least i think he stopped moment then added voice which seemed distrust itself your sister how did she her sufferings have been very severe i have only hope that they may be proportionately short it has been it is most cruel affliction till yesterday i believe she never doubted his regard even now perhaps but i am almost convinced that he never was really attached her he has been very deceitful some points there seems hardness heart about him ah said colonel brandon there is indeed but your sister does not i think you said so she does not consider quite as you do you know her disposition may believe how eagerly she would still justify him if she could he made no answer soon afterwards by removal tea things arrangement card parties subject was necessarily dropped mrs jennings who had watched them with pleasure while they were talking who expected see effect miss dashwood s communication such instantaneous gaiety on colonel brandon s side as might have become man bloom youth hope happiness saw him with amazement remain whole evening more serious thoughtful than usual chapter xxxi from night more sleep than she had expected marianne awoke next morning same consciousness misery which she had closed her eyes elinor encouraged her as much as possible talk what she felt before breakfast was ready they had gone through subject again again with same steady conviction affectionate counsel on elinor s side same impetuous feelings varying opinions on marianne s as before sometimes she could believe willoughby be as unfortunate as innocent as herself at others lost every consolation impossibility acquitting him at one moment she was absolutely indifferent observation all world at another she would seclude herself from it for ever at third could resist it with energy one thing however she was uniform when it came point avoiding where it was possible presence mrs jennings determined silence when obliged endure it her heart was hardened against belief mrs jennings s entering into her sorrows with any compassion no no no it cannot be she cried she cannot feel her kindness is not sympathy her good nature is not tenderness all that she wants is gossip she only likes me now because i supply it elinor had not needed this be assured injustice which her sister was often led her opinion others by irritable refinement her own mind too great importance placed by her on delicacies strong sensibility graces polished manner like half rest world if more than half there be that are clever good marianne with excellent abilities excellent disposition was neither reasonable nor candid she expected from other people same opinions feelings as her own she judged their motives by immediate effect their actions on herself thus circumstance occurred while sisters were together their own room after breakfast which sunk heart mrs jennings still lower her estimation because through her own weakness it chanced prove source fresh pain herself though mrs jennings was governed it by impulse utmost goodwill with letter her outstretched hand countenance gaily smiling from persuasion bringing comfort she entered their room saying now my dear i bring you something that i am sure will do you good marianne heard enough one moment her imagination placed before her letter from willoughby full tenderness contrition explanatory all that had passed satisfactory convincing instantly followed by willoughby himself rushing eagerly into room inforce at her feet by eloquence his eyes assurances his letter work one moment was destroyed by next hand writing her mother never till then unwelcome was before her acuteness disappointment which followed such ecstasy more than hope she felt as if till that instant she had never suffered cruelty mrs jennings no language within her reach her moments happiest eloquence could have expressed now she could reproach her only by tears which streamed from her eyes with passionate violence reproach however so entirely lost on its object that after many expressions pity she withdrew still referring her letter comfort but letter when she was calm enough read it brought little comfort willoughby filled every page her mother still confident their engagement relying as warmly as ever on his constancy had only been roused by elinor s application intreat from marianne greater openness towards them both this with such tenderness towards her such affection for willoughby such conviction their future happiness each other that she wept with agony through whole it all her impatience be at home again now returned her mother was dearer her than ever dearer through very excess her mistaken confidence willoughby she was wildly urgent be gone elinor unable herself determine whether it were better for marianne be london or at barton offered no counsel her own except patience till their mother s wishes could be known at length she obtained her sister s consent wait for that knowledge mrs jennings left them earlier than usual for she could not be easy till middletons palmers were able grieve as much as herself positively refusing elinor s offered attendance went out alone for rest morning elinor with very heavy heart aware pain she was going communicate perceiving by marianne s letter how ill she had succeeded laying any foundation for it then sat down write her mother account what had passed entreat her directions for future while marianne who came into drawing room on mrs jennings s going away remained fixed at table where elinor wrote watching advancement her pen grieving over her for hardship such task grieving still more fondly over its effect on her mother this manner they had continued about quarter hour when marianne whose nerves could not then bear any sudden noise was startled by rap at door who can this be cried elinor so early too i thought we had been safe marianne moved window it is colonel brandon said she with vexation we are never safe from him he will not come as mrs jennings is from home i will not trust that retreating her own room man who has nothing do with his own time has no conscience his intrusion on that others event proved her conjecture right though it was founded on injustice error for colonel brandon did come elinor who was convinced that solicitude for marianne brought him thither who saw that solicitude his disturbed melancholy look his anxious though brief inquiry after her could not forgive her sister for esteeming him so lightly i met mrs jennings bond street said he after first salutation she encouraged me come on i was more easily encouraged because i thought it probable that i might find you alone which i was very desirous doing my object my wish my sole wish desiring it i hope i believe it is is be means giving comfort no i must not say comfort not present comfort but conviction lasting conviction your sister s mind my regard for her for yourself for your mother will you allow me prove it by relating some circumstances which nothing but very sincere regard nothing but earnest desire being useful i think i am justified though where so many hours have been spent convincing myself that i am right is there not some reason fear i may be wrong he stopped i understand you said elinor you have something tell me mr willoughby that will open his character farther your telling it will be greatest act friendship that can be shown marianne my gratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending that end hers must be gained by it time pray pray let me hear it you shall be brief when i quitted barton last october but this will give you no idea i must go farther back you will find me very awkward narrator miss dashwood i hardly know where begin short account myself i believe will be necessary it shall be short one on such subject sighing heavily can i have little temptation be diffuse he stopt moment for recollection then with another sigh went on you have probably entirely forgotten conversation it is not be supposed that it could make any impression on you conversation between us one evening at barton park it was evening dance which i alluded lady i had once known as resembling some measure your sister marianne indeed answered elinor i have not forgotten it he looked pleased by this remembrance added if i am not deceived by uncertainty partiality tender recollection there is very strong resemblance between them as well mind as person same warmth heart same eagerness fancy spirits this lady was one my nearest relations orphan from her infancy under guardianship my father our ages were nearly same from our earliest years we were playfellows friends i cannot remember time when i did not love eliza my affection for her as we grew up was such as perhaps judging from my present forlorn cheerless gravity you might think me incapable having ever felt hers for me was i believe fervent as attachment your sister mr willoughby it was though from different cause no less unfortunate at seventeen she was lost me for ever she was married married against her inclination my brother her fortune was large our family estate much encumbered this i fear is all that can be said for conduct one who was at once her uncle guardian my brother did not deserve her he did not even love her i had hoped that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty for some time it did but at last misery her situation for she experienced great unkindness overcame all her resolution though she had promised me that nothing but how blindly i relate i have never told you how this was brought on we were within few hours eloping together for scotland treachery or folly my cousin s maid betrayed us i was banished house relation far distant she was allowed no liberty no society no amusement till my father s point was gained i had depended on her fortitude too far blow was severe one but had her marriage been happy so young as i then was few months must have reconciled me it or at least i should not have now lament it this however was not case my brother had no regard for her his pleasures were not what they ought have been from first he treated her unkindly consequence this upon mind so young so lively so inexperienced as mrs brandon s was but too natural she resigned herself at first all misery her situation happy had it been if she had not lived overcome those regrets which remembrance me occasioned but can we wonder that with such husband provoke inconstancy without friend advise or restrain her for my father lived only few months after their marriage i was with my regiment east indies she should fall had i remained england perhaps but i meant promote happiness both by removing from her for years for that purpose had procured my exchange shock which her marriage had given me he continued voice great agitation was trifling weight was nothing what i felt when i heard about two years afterwards her divorce it was that which threw this gloom even now recollection what i suffered he could say no more rising hastily walked for few minutes about room elinor affected by his relation still more by his distress could not speak he saw her concern coming her took her hand pressed it kissed it with grateful respect few minutes more silent exertion enabled him proceed with composure it was nearly three years after this unhappy period before i returned england my first care when i did arrive was course seek for her but search was as fruitless as it was melancholy i could not trace her beyond her first seducer there was every reason fear that she had removed from him only sink deeper life sin her legal allowance was not adequate her fortune nor sufficient for her comfortable maintenance i learnt from my brother that power receiving it had been made over some months before another person he imagined calmly could he imagine it that her extravagance consequent distress had obliged her dispose it for some immediate relief at last however after i had been six months england i did find her regard for former servant my own who had since fallen into misfortune carried me visit him spunging house where he was confined for debt there same house under similar confinement was my unfortunate sister so altered so faded worn down by acute suffering every kind hardly could i believe melancholy sickly figure before me be remains lovely blooming healthful girl on whom i had once doted what i endured so beholding her but i have no right wound your feelings by attempting describe it i have pained you too much already that she was all appearance last stage consumption was yes such situation it was my greatest comfort life could do nothing for her beyond giving time for better preparation for death that was given i saw her placed comfortable lodgings under proper attendants i visited her every day during rest her short life i was with her her last moments again he stopped recover himself elinor spoke her feelings exclamation tender concern at fate his unfortunate friend your sister i hope cannot be offended said he by resemblance i have fancied between her my poor disgraced relation their fates their fortunes cannot be same had natural sweet disposition one been guarded by firmer mind or happier marriage she might have been all that you will live see other be but what does all this lead i seem have been distressing you for nothing ah miss dashwood subject such as this untouched for fourteen years it is dangerous handle it at all i will be more collected more concise she left my care her only child little girl offspring her first guilty connection who was then about three years old she loved child had always kept it with her it was valued precious trust me gladly would i have discharged it strictest sense by watching over her education myself had nature our situations allowed it but i had no family no home my little eliza was therefore placed at school i saw her there whenever i could after death my brother which happened about five years ago which left me possession family property she visited me at delaford i called her distant relation but i am well aware that i have general been suspected much nearer connection with her it is now three years ago she had just reached her fourteenth year that i removed her from school place her under care very respectable woman residing dorsetshire who had charge four or five other girls about same time life for two years i had every reason be pleased with her situation but last february almost twelvemonth back she suddenly disappeared i had allowed her imprudently as it has since turned out at her earnest desire go bath with one her young friends who was attending her father there for his health i knew him be very good sort man i thought well his daughter better than she deserved for with most obstinate ill judged secrecy she would tell nothing would give no clue though she certainly knew all he her father well meaning but not quick sighted man could really i believe give no information for he had been generally confined house while girls were ranging over town making what acquaintance they chose he tried convince me as thoroughly as he was convinced himself his daughter s being entirely unconcerned business short i could learn nothing but that she was gone all rest for eight long months was left conjecture what i thought what i feared may be imagined what i suffered too good heavens cried elinor could it be could willoughby first news that reached me her he continued came letter from herself last october it was forwarded me from delaford i received it on very morning our intended party whitwell this was reason my leaving barton so suddenly which i am sure must at time have appeared strange every body which i believe gave offence some little did mr willoughby imagine i suppose when his looks censured me for incivility breaking up party that i was called away relief one whom he had made poor miserable but had he known it what would it have availed would he have been less gay or less happy smiles your sister no he had already done that which no man who can feel for another would do he had left girl whose youth innocence he had seduced situation utmost distress with no creditable home no help no friends ignorant his address he had left her promising return he neither returned nor wrote nor relieved her this is beyond every thing exclaimed elinor his character is now before you expensive dissipated worse than both knowing all this as i have now known it many weeks guess what i must have felt on seeing your sister as fond him as ever on being assured that she was marry him guess what i must have felt for all your sakes when i came you last week found you alone i came determined know truth though irresolute what do when it was known my behaviour must have seemed strange you then but now you will comprehend it suffer you all be so deceived see your sister but what could i do i had no hope interfering with success sometimes i thought your sister s influence might yet reclaim him but now after such dishonorable usage who can tell what were his designs on her whatever they may have been however she may now hereafter doubtless will turn with gratitude towards her own condition when she compares it with that my poor eliza when she considers wretched hopeless situation this poor girl pictures her herself with affection for him so strong still as strong as her own with mind tormented by self reproach which must attend her through life surely this comparison must have its use with her she will feel her own sufferings be nothing they proceed from no misconduct can bring no disgrace on contrary every friend must be made still more her friend by them concern for her unhappiness respect for her fortitude under it must strengthen every attachment use your own discretion however communicating her what i have told you you must know best what will be its effect but had i not seriously from my heart believed it might be service might lessen her regrets i would not have suffered myself trouble you with this account my family afflictions with recital which may seem have been intended raise myself at expense others elinor s thanks followed this speech with grateful earnestness attended too with assurance her expecting material advantage marianne from communication what had passed i have been more pained said she by her endeavors acquit him than by all rest for it irritates her mind more than most perfect conviction his unworthiness can do now though at first she will suffer much i am sure she will soon become easier have you she continued after short silence ever seen mr willoughby since you left him at barton yes he replied gravely once i have one meeting was unavoidable elinor startled by his manner looked at him anxiously saying what have you met him i could meet him no other way eliza had confessed me though most reluctantly name her lover when he returned town which was within fortnight after myself we met by appointment he defend i punish his conduct we returned unwounded meeting therefore never got abroad elinor sighed over fancied necessity this but man soldier she presumed not censure it such said colonel brandon after pause has been unhappy resemblance between fate mother daughter so imperfectly have i discharged my trust is she still town no as soon as she recovered from her lying for i found her near her delivery i removed her her child into country there she remains recollecting soon afterwards that he was probably dividing elinor from her sister he put end his visit receiving from her again same grateful acknowledgments leaving her full compassion esteem for him chapter xxxii when particulars this conversation were repeated by miss dashwood her sister as they very soon were effect on her was not entirely such as former had hoped see not that marianne appeared distrust truth any part it for she listened it all with most steady submissive attention made neither objection nor remark attempted no vindication willoughby seemed show by her tears that she felt it be impossible but though this behaviour assured elinor that conviction this guilt was carried home her mind though she saw with satisfaction effect it her no longer avoiding colonel brandon when he called her speaking him even voluntarily speaking with kind compassionate respect though she saw her spirits less violently irritated than before she did not see her less wretched her mind did become settled but it was settled gloomy dejection she felt loss willoughby s character yet more heavily than she had felt loss his heart his seduction desertion miss williams misery that poor girl doubt what his designs might once have been on herself preyed altogether so much on her spirits that she could not bring herself speak what she felt even elinor brooding over her sorrows silence gave more pain her sister than could have been communicated by most open most frequent confession them give feelings or language mrs dashwood on receiving answering elinor s letter would be only give repetition what her daughters had already felt said disappointment hardly less painful than marianne s indignation even greater than elinor s long letters from her quickly succeeding each other arrived tell all that she suffered thought express her anxious solicitude for marianne entreat she would bear up with fortitude under this misfortune bad indeed must nature marianne s affliction be when her mother could talk fortitude mortifying humiliating must be origin those regrets which she could wish her not indulge against interest her own individual comfort mrs dashwood had determined that it would be better for marianne be any where at that time than at barton where every thing within her view would be bringing back past strongest most afflicting manner by constantly placing willoughby before her such as she had always seen him there she recommended it her daughters therefore by all means not shorten their visit mrs jennings length which though never exactly fixed had been expected by all comprise at least five or six weeks variety occupations objects company which could not be procured at barton would be inevitable there might yet she hoped cheat marianne at times into some interest beyond herself even into some amusement much as ideas both might now be spurned by her from all danger seeing willoughby again her mother considered her be at least equally safe town as country since his acquaintance must now be dropped by all who called themselves her friends design could never bring them each other s way negligence could never leave them exposed surprise chance had less its favour crowd london than even retirement barton where it might force him before her while paying that visit at allenham on his marriage which mrs dashwood from foreseeing at first as probable event had brought herself expect as certain one she had yet another reason for wishing her children remain where they were letter from her son law had told her that he his wife were be town before middle february she judged it right that they should sometimes see their brother marianne had promised be guided by her mother s opinion she submitted it therefore without opposition though it proved perfectly different from what she wished expected though she felt it be entirely wrong formed on mistaken grounds that by requiring her longer continuance london it deprived her only possible alleviation her wretchedness personal sympathy her mother doomed her such society such scenes as must prevent her ever knowing moment s rest but it was matter great consolation her that what brought evil herself would bring good her sister elinor on other hand suspecting that it would not be her power avoid edward entirely comforted herself by thinking that though their longer stay would therefore militate against her own happiness it would be better for marianne than immediate return into devonshire her carefulness guarding her sister from ever hearing willoughby s name mentioned was not thrown away marianne though without knowing it herself reaped all its advantage for neither mrs jennings nor sir john nor even mrs palmer herself ever spoke him before her elinor wished that same forbearance could have extended towards herself but that was impossible she was obliged listen day after day indignation them all sir john could not have thought it possible man whom he had always had such reason think well such good natured fellow he did not believe there was bolder rider england it was unaccountable business he wished him at devil with all his heart he would not speak another word him meet him where he might for all world no not if it were be by side barton covert they were kept watching for two hours together such scoundrel fellow such deceitful dog it was only last time they met that he had offered him one folly s puppies this was end it mrs palmer her way was equally angry she was determined drop his acquaintance immediately she was very thankful that she had never been acquainted with him at all she wished with all her heart combe magna was not so near cleveland but it did not signify for it was great deal too far off visit she hated him so much that she was resolved never mention his name again she should tell everybody she saw how good for nothing he was rest mrs palmer s sympathy was shown procuring all particulars her power approaching marriage communicating them elinor she could soon tell at what coachmaker s new carriage was building by what painter mr willoughby s portrait was drawn at what warehouse miss grey s clothes might be seen calm polite unconcern lady middleton on occasion was happy relief elinor s spirits oppressed as they often were by clamorous kindness others it was great comfort her be sure exciting no interest one person at least among their circle friends great comfort know that there was one who would meet her without feeling any curiosity after particulars or any anxiety for her sister s health every qualification is raised at times by circumstances moment more than its real value she was sometimes worried down by officious condolence rate good breeding as more indispensable comfort than good nature lady middleton expressed her sense affair about once every day or twice if subject occurred very often by saying it is very shocking indeed by means this continual though gentle vent was able not only see miss dashwoods from first without smallest emotion but very soon see them without recollecting word matter having thus supported dignity her own sex spoken her decided censure what was wrong other she thought herself at liberty attend interest her own assemblies therefore determined though rather against opinion sir john that as mrs willoughby would at once be woman elegance fortune leave her card with her as soon as she married colonel brandon s delicate unobtrusive enquiries were never unwelcome miss dashwood he had abundantly earned privilege intimate discussion her sister s disappointment by friendly zeal with which he had endeavoured soften it they always conversed with confidence his chief reward for painful exertion disclosing past sorrows present humiliations was given pitying eye with which marianne sometimes observed him gentleness her voice whenever though it did not often happen she was obliged or could oblige herself speak him these assured him that his exertion had produced increase good will towards himself these gave elinor hopes its being farther augmented hereafter but mrs jennings who knew nothing all this who knew only that colonel continued as grave as ever that she could neither prevail on him make offer himself nor commission her make it for him began at end two days think that instead midsummer they would not be married till michaelmas by end week that it would not be match at all good understanding between colonel miss dashwood seemed rather declare that honours mulberry tree canal yew arbour would all be made over her mrs jennings had for some time ceased think at all mrs ferrars early february within fortnight from receipt willoughby s letter elinor had painful office informing her sister that he was married she had taken care have intelligence conveyed herself as soon as it was known that ceremony was over as she was desirous that marianne should not receive first notice it from public papers which she saw her eagerly examining every morning she received news with resolute composure made no observation on it at first shed no tears but after short time they would burst out for rest day she was state hardly less pitiable than when she first learnt expect event willoughbys left town as soon as they were married elinor now hoped as there could be no danger her seeing either them prevail on her sister who had never yet left house since blow first fell go out again by degrees as she had done before about this time two miss steeles lately arrived at their cousin s house bartlett s buildings holburn presented themselves again before their more grand relations conduit berkeley streets were welcomed by them all with great cordiality elinor only was sorry see them their presence always gave her pain she hardly knew how make very gracious return overpowering delight lucy finding her still town i should have been quite disappointed if i had not found you here still said she repeatedly with strong emphasis on word but i always thought i should i was almost sure you would not leave london yet awhile though you told me you know at barton that you should not stay above month but i thought at time that you would most likely change your mind when it came point it would have been such great pity have went away before your brother sister came now be sure you will be no hurry be gone i am amazingly glad you did not keep your word elinor perfectly understood her was forced use all her self command make it appear that she did not well my dear said mrs jennings how did you travel not stage i assure you replied miss steele with quick exultation we came post all way had very smart beau attend us dr davies was coming town so we thought we d join him post chaise he behaved very genteelly paid ten or twelve shillings more than we did oh oh cried mrs jennings very pretty indeed doctor is single man i warrant you there now said miss steele affectedly simpering everybody laughs at me so about doctor i cannot think why my cousins say they are sure i have made conquest but for my part i declare i never think about him from one hour s end another lord here comes your beau nancy my cousin said t other day when she saw him crossing street house my beau indeed said i i cannot think who you mean doctor is no beau mine aye aye that is very pretty talking but it won t do doctor is man i see no indeed replied her cousin with affected earnestness i beg you will contradict it if you ever hear it talked mrs jennings directly gave her gratifying assurance that she certainly would not miss steele was made completely happy i suppose you will go stay with your brother sister miss dashwood when they come town said lucy returning after cessation hostile hints charge no i do not think we shall oh yes i dare say you will elinor would not humour her by farther opposition what charming thing it is that mrs dashwood can spare you both for so long time together long time indeed interposed mrs jennings why their visit is but just begun lucy was silenced i am sorry we cannot see your sister miss dashwood said miss steele i am sorry she is not well for marianne had left room on their arrival you are very good my sister will be equally sorry miss pleasure seeing you but she has been very much plagued lately with nervous head aches which make her unfit for company or conversation oh dear that is great pity but such old friends as lucy me i think she might see us i am sure we would not speak word elinor with great civility declined proposal her sister was perhaps laid down upon bed or her dressing gown therefore not able come them oh if that s all cried miss steele we can just as well go see her elinor began find this impertinence too much for her temper but she was saved trouble checking it by lucy s sharp reprimand which now as on many occasions though it did not give much sweetness manners one sister was advantage governing those other chapter xxxiii after some opposition marianne yielded her sister s entreaties consented go out with her mrs jennings one morning for half hour she expressly conditioned however for paying no visits would do no more than accompany them gray s sackville street where elinor was carrying on negotiation for exchange few old fashioned jewels her mother when they stopped at door mrs jennings recollected that there was lady at other end street on whom she ought call as she had no business at gray s it was resolved that while her young friends transacted their s she should pay her visit return for them on ascending stairs miss dashwoods found so many people before them room that there was not person at liberty tend their orders they were obliged wait all that could be done was sit down at that end counter which seemed promise quickest succession one gentleman only was standing there it is probable that elinor was not without hope exciting his politeness quicker despatch but correctness his eye delicacy his taste proved be beyond his politeness he was giving orders for toothpick case for himself till its size shape ornaments were determined all which after examining debating for quarter hour over every toothpick case shop were finally arranged by his own inventive fancy he had no leisure bestow any other attention on two ladies than what was comprised three or four very broad stares kind notice which served imprint on elinor remembrance person face strong natural sterling insignificance though adorned first style fashion marianne was spared from troublesome feelings contempt resentment on this impertinent examination their features on puppyism his manner deciding on all different horrors different toothpick cases presented his inspection by remaining unconscious it all for she was as well able collect her thoughts within herself be as ignorant what was passing around her mr gray s shop as her own bedroom at last affair was decided ivory gold pearls all received their appointment gentleman having named last day on which his existence could be continued without possession toothpick case drew on his gloves with leisurely care bestowing another glance on miss dashwoods but such one as seemed rather demand than express admiration walked off with happy air real conceit affected indifference elinor lost no time bringing her business forward was on point concluding it when another gentleman presented himself at her side she turned her eyes towards his face found him with some surprise be her brother their affection pleasure meeting was just enough make very creditable appearance mr gray s shop john dashwood was really far from being sorry see his sisters again it rather gave them satisfaction his inquiries after their mother were respectful attentive elinor found that he fanny had been town two days i wished very much call upon you yesterday said he but it was impossible for we were obliged take harry see wild beasts at exeter exchange we spent rest day with mrs ferrars harry was vastly pleased this morning i had fully intended call on you if i could possibly find spare half hour but one has always so much do on first coming town i am come here bespeak fanny seal but tomorrow i think i shall certainly be able call berkeley street be introduced your friend mrs jennings i understand she is woman very good fortune middletons too you must introduce me them as my mother law s relations i shall be happy show them every respect they are excellent neighbours you country i understand excellent indeed their attention our comfort their friendliness every particular is more than i can express i am extremely glad hear it upon my word extremely glad indeed but so it ought be they are people large fortune they are related you every civility accommodation that can serve make your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected so you are most comfortably settled your little cottage want for nothing edward brought us most charming account place most complete thing its kind he said that ever was you all seemed enjoy it beyond any thing it was great satisfaction us hear it i assure you elinor did feel little ashamed her brother was not sorry be spared necessity answering him by arrival mrs jennings s servant who came tell her that his mistress waited for them at door mr dashwood attended them down stairs was introduced mrs jennings at door her carriage repeating his hope being able call on them next day took leave his visit was duly paid he came with pretence at apology from their sister law for not coming too but she was so much engaged with her mother that really she had no leisure for going any where mrs jennings however assured him directly that she should not stand upon ceremony for they were all cousins or something like it she should certainly wait on mrs john dashwood very soon bring her sisters see her his manners them though calm were perfectly kind mrs jennings most attentively civil on colonel brandon s coming soon after himself he eyed him with curiosity which seemed say that he only wanted know him be rich be equally civil him after staying with them half hour he asked elinor walk with him conduit street introduce him sir john lady middleton weather was remarkably fine she readily consented as soon as they were out house his enquiries began who is colonel brandon is he man fortune yes he has very good property dorsetshire i am glad it he seems most gentlemanlike man i think elinor i may congratulate you on prospect very respectable establishment life me brother what do you mean he likes you i observed him narrowly am convinced it what is amount his fortune i believe about two thousand year two thousand year then working himself up pitch enthusiastic generosity he added elinor i wish with all my heart it were twice as much for your sake indeed i believe you replied elinor but i am very sure that colonel brandon has not smallest wish marrying me you are mistaken elinor you are very much mistaken very little trouble on your side secures him perhaps just at present he may be undecided smallness your fortune may make him hang back his friends may all advise him against it but some those little attentions encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix him spite himself there can be no reason why you should not try for him it is not be supposed that any prior attachment on your side short you know as attachment that kind it is quite out question objections are insurmountable you have too much sense not see all that colonel brandon must be man no civility shall be wanting on my part make him pleased with you your family it is match that must give universal satisfaction short it is kind thing that lowering his voice important whisper will be exceedingly welcome all parties recollecting himself however he added that is i mean say your friends are all truly anxious see you well settled fanny particularly for she has your interest very much at heart i assure you her mother too mrs ferrars very good natured woman i am sure it would give her great pleasure she said as much other day elinor would not vouchsafe any answer it would be something remarkable now he continued something droll if fanny should have brother i sister settling at same time yet it is not very unlikely is mr edward ferrars said elinor with resolution going be married it is not actually settled but there is such thing agitation he has most excellent mother mrs ferrars with utmost liberality will come forward settle on him thousand year if match takes place lady is hon miss morton only daughter late lord morton with thirty thousand pounds very desirable connection on both sides i have not doubt its taking place time thousand year is great deal for mother give away make over for ever but mrs ferrars has noble spirit give you another instance her liberality other day as soon as we came town aware that money could not be very plenty with us just now she put bank notes into fanny s hands amount two hundred pounds extremely acceptable it is for we must live at great expense while we are here he paused for her assent compassion she forced herself say your expenses both town country must certainly be considerable but your income is large one not so large i dare say as many people suppose i do not mean complain however it is undoubtedly comfortable one i hope will time be better enclosure norland common now carrying on is most serious drain then i have made little purchase within this half year east kingham farm you must remember place where old gibson used live land was so very desirable for me every respect so immediately adjoining my own property that i felt it my duty buy it i could not have answered it my conscience let it fall into any other hands man must pay for his convenience it has cost me vast deal money more than you think it really intrinsically worth why i hope not that i might have sold it again next day for more than i gave but with regard purchase money i might have been very unfortunate indeed for stocks were at that time so low that if i had not happened have necessary sum my banker s hands i must have sold out very great loss elinor could only smile other great inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming norland our respected father as you well know bequeathed all stanhill effects that remained at norland very valuable they were your mother far be it from me repine at his doing so he had undoubted right dispose his own property as he chose but consequence it we have been obliged make large purchases linen china c supply place what was taken away you may guess after all these expenses how very far we must be from being rich how acceptable mrs ferrars s kindness is certainly said elinor assisted by her liberality i hope you may yet live be easy circumstances another year or two may do much towards it he gravely replied but however there is still great deal be done there is not stone laid fanny s green house nothing but plan flower garden marked out where is green house be upon knoll behind house old walnut trees are all come down make room for it it will be very fine object from many parts park flower garden will slope down just before it be exceedingly pretty we have cleared away all old thorns that grew patches over brow elinor kept her concern her censure herself was very thankful that marianne was not present share provocation having now said enough make his poverty clear do away necessity buying pair ear rings for each his sisters his next visit at gray s his thoughts took cheerfuller turn he began congratulate elinor on having such friend as mrs jennings she seems most valuable woman indeed her house her style living all bespeak exceeding good income it is acquaintance that has not only been great use you hitherto but end may prove materially advantageous her inviting you town is certainly vast thing your favour indeed it speaks altogether so great regard for you that all probability when she dies you will not be forgotten she must have great deal leave nothing at all i should rather suppose for she has only her jointure which will descend her children but it is not be imagined that she lives up her income few people common prudence will do that whatever she saves she will be able dispose do you not think it more likely that she should leave it her daughters than us her daughters are both exceedingly well married therefore i cannot perceive necessity her remembering them farther whereas my opinion by her taking so much notice you treating you this kind way she has given you sort claim on her future consideration which conscientious woman would not disregard nothing can be kinder than her behaviour she can hardly do all this without being aware expectation it raises but she raises none those most concerned indeed brother your anxiety for our welfare prosperity carries you too far why be sure said he seeming recollect himself people have little have very little their power but my dear elinor what is matter with marianne she looks very unwell has lost her colour is grown quite thin is she ill she is not well she has had nervous complaint on her for several weeks i am sorry for that at her time life any thing illness destroys bloom for ever hers has been very short one she was as handsome girl last september as i ever saw as likely attract man there was something her style beauty please them particularly i remember fanny used say that she would marry sooner better than you did not but what she is exceedingly fond you but so it happened strike her she will be mistaken however i question whether marianne now will marry man worth more than five or six hundred year at utmost i am very much deceived if you do not do better dorsetshire i know very little dorsetshire but my dear elinor i shall be exceedingly glad know more it i think i can answer for your having fanny myself among earliest best pleased your visitors elinor tried very seriously convince him that there was no likelihood her marrying colonel brandon but it was expectation too much pleasure himself be relinquished he was really resolved on seeking intimacy with that gentleman promoting marriage by every possible attention he had just compunction enough for having done nothing for his sisters himself be exceedingly anxious that everybody else should do great deal offer from colonel brandon or legacy from mrs jennings was easiest means atoning for his own neglect they were lucky enough find lady middleton at home sir john came before their visit ended abundance civilities passed on all sides sir john was ready like anybody though mr dashwood did not seem know much about horses he soon set him down as very good natured fellow while lady middleton saw enough fashion his appearance think his acquaintance worth having mr dashwood went away delighted with both i shall have charming account carry fanny said he as he walked back with his sister lady middleton is really most elegant woman such woman as i am sure fanny will be glad know mrs jennings too exceedingly well behaved woman though not so elegant as her daughter your sister need not have any scruple even visiting her which say truth has been little case very naturally for we only knew that mrs jennings was widow man who had got all his money low way fanny mrs ferrars were both strongly prepossessed that neither she nor her daughters were such kind women as fanny would like associate with but now i can carry her most satisfactory account both chapter xxxiv mrs john dashwood had so much confidence her husband s judgment that she waited very next day both on mrs jennings her daughter her confidence was rewarded by finding even former even woman with whom her sisters were staying by no means unworthy her notice as for lady middleton she found her one most charming women world lady middleton was equally pleased with mrs dashwood there was kind cold hearted selfishness on both sides which mutually attracted them they sympathised with each other insipid propriety demeanor general want understanding same manners however which recommended mrs john dashwood good opinion lady middleton did not suit fancy mrs jennings her she appeared nothing more than little proud looking woman uncordial address who met her husband s sisters without any affection almost without having anything say them for quarter hour bestowed on berkeley street she sat at least seven minutes half silence elinor wanted very much know though she did not chuse ask whether edward was then town but nothing would have induced fanny voluntarily mention his name before her till able tell her that his marriage with miss morton was resolved on or till her husband s expectations on colonel brandon were answered because she believed them still so very much attached each other that they could not be too sedulously divided word deed on every occasion intelligence however which she would not give soon flowed from another quarter lucy came very shortly claim elinor s compassion on being unable see edward though he had arrived town with mr mrs dashwood he dared not come bartlett s buildings for fear detection though their mutual impatience meet was not be told they could do nothing at present but write edward assured them himself his being town within very short time by twice calling berkeley street twice was his card found on table when they returned from their morning s engagements elinor was pleased that he had called still more pleased that she had missed him dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted with middletons that though not much habit giving anything they determined give them dinner soon after their acquaintance began invited them dine harley street where they had taken very good house for three months their sisters mrs jennings were invited likewise john dashwood was careful secure colonel brandon who always glad be where miss dashwoods were received his eager civilities with some surprise but much more pleasure they were meet mrs ferrars but elinor could not learn whether her sons were be party expectation seeing her however was enough make her interested engagement for though she could now meet edward s mother without that strong anxiety which had once promised attend such introduction though she could now see her with perfect indifference as her opinion herself her desire being company with mrs ferrars her curiosity know what she was like was as lively as ever interest with which she thus anticipated party was soon afterwards increased more powerfully than pleasantly by her hearing that miss steeles were also be at it so well had they recommended themselves lady middleton so agreeable had their assiduities made them her that though lucy was certainly not so elegant her sister not even genteel she was as ready as sir john ask them spend week or two conduit street it happened be particularly convenient miss steeles as soon as dashwoods invitation was known that their visit should begin few days before party took place their claims notice mrs john dashwood as nieces gentleman who for many years had had care her brother might not have done much however towards procuring them seats at her table but as lady middleton s guests they must be welcome lucy who had long wanted be personally known family have nearer view their characters her own difficulties have opportunity endeavouring please them had seldom been happier her life than she was on receiving mrs john dashwood s card on elinor its effect was very different she began immediately determine that edward who lived with his mother must be asked as his mother was party given by his sister see him for first time after all that passed company lucy she hardly knew how she could bear it these apprehensions perhaps were not founded entirely on reason certainly not at all on truth they were relieved however not by her own recollection but by good will lucy who believed herself be inflicting severe disappointment when she told her that edward certainly would not be harley street on tuesday even hoped be carrying pain still farther by persuading her that he was kept away by extreme affection for herself which he could not conceal when they were together important tuesday came that was introduce two young ladies this formidable mother law pity me dear miss dashwood said lucy as they walked up stairs together for middletons arrived so directly after mrs jennings that they all followed servant at same time there is nobody here but you that can feel for me i declare i can hardly stand good gracious moment i shall see person that all my happiness depends on that is be my mother elinor could have given her immediate relief by suggesting possibility its being miss morton s mother rather than her own whom they were about behold but instead doing that she assured her with great sincerity that she did pity her utter amazement lucy who though really uncomfortable herself hoped at least be object irrepressible envy elinor mrs ferrars was little thin woman upright even formality her figure serious even sourness her aspect her complexion was sallow her features small without beauty naturally without expression but lucky contraction brow had rescued her countenance from disgrace insipidity by giving it strong characters pride ill nature she was not woman many words for unlike people general she proportioned them number her ideas few syllables that did escape her not one fell share miss dashwood whom she eyed with spirited determination disliking her at all events elinor could not now be made unhappy by this behaviour few months ago it would have hurt her exceedingly but it was not mrs ferrars power distress her by it now difference her manners miss steeles difference which seemed purposely made humble her more only amused her she could not but smile see graciousness both mother daughter towards very person for lucy was particularly distinguished whom all others had they known as much as she did they would have been most anxious mortify while she herself who had comparatively no power wound them sat pointedly slighted by both but while she smiled at graciousness so misapplied she could not reflect on mean spirited folly from which it sprung nor observe studied attentions with which miss steeles courted its continuance without thoroughly despising them all four lucy was all exultation on being so honorably distinguished miss steele wanted only be teazed about dr davies be perfectly happy dinner was grand one servants were numerous every thing bespoke mistress s inclination for show master s ability support it spite improvements additions which were making norland estate spite its owner having once been within some thousand pounds being obliged sell out at loss nothing gave any symptom that indigence which he had tried infer from it no poverty any kind except conversation appeared but there deficiency was considerable john dashwood had not much say for himself that was worth hearing his wife had still less but there was no peculiar disgrace this for it was very much case with chief their visitors who almost all laboured under one or other these disqualifications for being agreeable want sense either natural or improved want elegance want spirits or want temper when ladies withdrew drawing room after dinner this poverty was particularly evident for gentlemen had supplied discourse with some variety variety politics inclosing land breaking horses but then it was all over one subject only engaged ladies till coffee came which was comparative heights harry dashwood lady middleton s second son william who were nearly same age had both children been there affair might have been determined too easily by measuring them at once but as harry only was present it was all conjectural assertion on both sides every body had right be equally positive their opinion repeat it over over again as often as they liked parties stood thus two mothers though each really convinced that her own son was tallest politely decided favour other two grandmothers with not less partiality but more sincerity were equally earnest support their own descendant lucy who was hardly less anxious please one parent than other thought boys were both remarkably tall for their age could not conceive that there could be smallest difference world between them miss steele with yet greater address gave it as fast as she could favour each elinor having once delivered her opinion on william s side by which she offended mrs ferrars fanny still more did not see necessity enforcing it by any farther assertion marianne when called on for hers offended them all by declaring that she had no opinion give as she had never thought about it before her removing from norland elinor had painted very pretty pair screens for her sister law which being now just mounted brought home ornamented her present drawing room these screens catching eye john dashwood on his following other gentlemen into room were officiously handed by him colonel brandon for his admiration these are done by my eldest sister said he you as man taste will i dare say be pleased with them i do not know whether you have ever happened see any her performances before but she is general reckoned draw extremely well colonel though disclaiming all pretensions connoisseurship warmly admired screens as he would have done any thing painted by miss dashwood on curiosity others being course excited they were handed round for general inspection mrs ferrars not aware their being elinor s work particularly requested look at them after they had received gratifying testimony lady middletons s approbation fanny presented them her mother considerately informing her at same time that they were done by miss dashwood hum said mrs ferrars very pretty without regarding them at all returned them her daughter perhaps fanny thought for moment that her mother had been quite rude enough for colouring little she immediately said they are very pretty ma am t they but then again dread having been too civil too encouraging herself probably came over her for she presently added do you not think they are something miss morton s style painting ma am she does paint most delightfully how beautifully her last landscape is done beautifully indeed but she does every thing well marianne could not bear this she was already greatly displeased with mrs ferrars such ill timed praise another at elinor s expense though she had not any notion what was principally meant by it provoked her immediately say with warmth this is admiration very particular kind what is miss morton us who knows or who cares for her it is elinor whom we think speak so saying she took screens out her sister law s hands admire them herself as they ought be admired mrs ferrars looked exceedingly angry drawing herself up more stiffly than ever pronounced retort this bitter philippic miss morton is lord morton s daughter fanny looked very angry too her husband was all fright at his sister s audacity elinor was much more hurt by marianne s warmth than she had been by what produced it but colonel brandon s eyes as they were fixed on marianne declared that he noticed only what was amiable it affectionate heart which could not bear see sister slighted smallest point marianne s feelings did not stop here cold insolence mrs ferrars s general behaviour her sister seemed her foretell such difficulties distresses elinor as her own wounded heart taught her think with horror urged by strong impulse affectionate sensibility she moved after moment her sister s chair putting one arm round her neck one cheek close hers said low but eager voice dear dear elinor don t mind them don t let them make you unhappy she could say no more her spirits were quite overcome hiding her face on elinor s shoulder she burst into tears every body s attention was called almost every body was concerned colonel brandon rose up went them without knowing what he did mrs jennings with very intelligent ah poor dear immediately gave her her salts sir john felt so desperately enraged against author this nervous distress that he instantly changed his seat one close by lucy steele gave her whisper brief account whole shocking affair few minutes however marianne was recovered enough put end bustle sit down among rest though her spirits retained impression what had passed whole evening poor marianne said her brother colonel brandon low voice as soon as he could secure his attention she has not such good health as her sister she is very nervous she has not elinor s constitution one must allow that there is something very trying young woman who has been beauty loss her personal attractions you would not think it perhaps but marianne was remarkably handsome few months ago quite as handsome as elinor now you see it is all gone chapter xxxv elinor s curiosity see mrs ferrars was satisfied she had found her every thing that could tend make farther connection between families undesirable she had seen enough her pride her meanness her determined prejudice against herself comprehend all difficulties that must have perplexed engagement retarded marriage edward herself had he been otherwise free she had seen almost enough be thankful for her own sake that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any other mrs ferrars s creation preserved her from all dependence upon her caprice or any solicitude for her good opinion or at least if she did not bring herself quite rejoice edward s being fettered lucy she determined that had lucy been more amiable she ought have rejoiced she wondered that lucy s spirits could be so very much elevated by civility mrs ferrars that her interest her vanity should so very much blind her as make attention which seemed only paid her because she was not elinor appear compliment herself or allow her derive encouragement from preference only given her because her real situation was unknown but that it was so had not only been declared by lucy s eyes at time but was declared over again next morning more openly for at her particular desire lady middleton set her down berkeley street on chance seeing elinor alone tell her how happy she was chance proved lucky one for message from mrs palmer soon after she arrived carried mrs jennings away my dear friend cried lucy as soon as they were by themselves i come talk you my happiness could anything be so flattering as mrs ferrars s way treating me yesterday so exceeding affable as she was you know how i dreaded thoughts seeing her but very moment i was introduced there was such affability her behaviour as really should seem say she had quite took fancy me now was not it so you saw it all was not you quite struck with it she was certainly very civil you civil did you see nothing but only civility i saw vast deal more such kindness as fell share nobody but me no pride no hauteur your sister just same all sweetness affability elinor wished talk something else but lucy still pressed her own that she had reason for her happiness elinor was obliged go on undoubtedly if they had known your engagement said she nothing could be more flattering than their treatment you but as that was not case i guessed you would say so replied lucy quickly but there was no reason world why mrs ferrars should seem like me if she did not her liking me is every thing you shan t talk me out my satisfaction i am sure it will all end well there will be no difficulties at all what i used think mrs ferrars is charming woman so is your sister they are both delightful women indeed i wonder i should never hear you say how agreeable mrs dashwood was this elinor had no answer make did not attempt any are you ill miss dashwood you seem low you don t speak sure you t well i never was better health i am glad it with all my heart but really you did not look it i should be sorry have you ill you that have been greatest comfort me world heaven knows what i should have done without your friendship elinor tried make civil answer though doubting her own success but it seemed satisfy lucy for she directly replied indeed i am perfectly convinced your regard for me next edward s love it is greatest comfort i have poor edward but now there is one good thing we shall be able meet meet pretty often for lady middleton s delighted with mrs dashwood so we shall be good deal harley street i dare say edward spends half his time with his sister besides lady middleton mrs ferrars will visit now mrs ferrars your sister were both so good say more than once they should always be glad see me they are such charming women i am sure if ever you tell your sister what i think her you cannot speak too high but elinor would not give her any encouragement hope that she should tell her sister lucy continued i am sure i should have seen it moment if mrs ferrars had took dislike me if she had only made me formal courtesy for instance without saying word never after had took any notice me never looked at me pleasant way you know what i mean if i had been treated that forbidding sort way i should have gave it all up despair i could not have stood it for where she does dislike i know it is most violent elinor was prevented from making any reply this civil triumph by door s being thrown open servant s announcing mr ferrars edward s immediately walking it was very awkward moment countenance each showed that it was so they all looked exceedingly foolish edward seemed have as great inclination walk out room again as advance farther into it very circumstance its unpleasantest form which they would each have been most anxious avoid had fallen on them they were not only all three together but were together without relief any other person ladies recovered themselves first it was not lucy s business put herself forward appearance secrecy must still be kept up she could therefore only look her tenderness after slightly addressing him said no more but elinor had more do so anxious was she for his sake her own do it well that she forced herself after moment s recollection welcome him with look manner that were almost easy almost open another struggle another effort still improved them she would not allow presence lucy nor consciousness some injustice towards herself deter her from saying that she was happy see him that she had very much regretted being from home when he called before berkeley street she would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which as friend almost relation were his due by observant eyes lucy though she soon perceived them be narrowly watching her her manners gave some re assurance edward he had courage enough sit down but his embarrassment still exceeded that ladies proportion which case rendered reasonable though his sex might make it rare for his heart had not indifference lucy s nor could his conscience have quite ease elinor s lucy with demure settled air seemed determined make no contribution comfort others would not say word almost every thing that was said proceeded from elinor who was obliged volunteer all information about her mother s health their coming town c which edward ought have inquired about but never did her exertions did not stop here for she soon afterwards felt herself so heroically disposed as determine under pretence fetching marianne leave others by themselves she really did it that handsomest manner for she loitered away several minutes on landing place with most high minded fortitude before she went her sister when that was once done however it was time for raptures edward cease for marianne s joy hurried her into drawing room immediately her pleasure seeing him was like every other her feelings strong itself strongly spoken she met him with hand that would be taken voice that expressed affection sister dear edward she cried this is moment great happiness this would almost make amends for every thing edward tried return her kindness as it deserved but before such witnesses he dared not say half what he really felt again they all sat down for moment or two all were silent while marianne was looking with most speaking tenderness sometimes at edward sometimes at elinor regretting only that their delight each other should be checked by lucy s unwelcome presence edward was first speak it was notice marianne s altered looks express his fear her not finding london agree with her oh don t think me she replied with spirited earnestness though her eyes were filled with tears as she spoke don t think my health elinor is well you see that must be enough for us both this remark was not calculated make edward or elinor more easy nor conciliate good will lucy who looked up at marianne with no very benignant expression do you like london said edward willing say any thing that might introduce another subject not at all i expected much pleasure it but i have found none sight you edward is only comfort it has afforded thank heaven you are what you always were she paused no one spoke i think elinor she presently added we must employ edward take care us our return barton week or two i suppose we shall be going i trust edward will not be very unwilling accept charge poor edward muttered something but what it was nobody knew not even himself but marianne who saw his agitation could easily trace it whatever cause best pleased herself was perfectly satisfied soon talked something else we spent such day edward harley street yesterday so dull so wretchedly dull but i have much say you on that head which cannot be said now with this admirable discretion did she defer assurance her finding their mutual relatives more disagreeable than ever her being particularly disgusted with his mother till they were more private but why were you not there edward why did you not come i was engaged elsewhere engaged but what was that when such friends were be met perhaps miss marianne cried lucy eager take some revenge on her you think young men never stand upon engagements if they have no mind keep them little as well as great elinor was very angry but marianne seemed entirely insensible sting for she calmly replied not so indeed for seriously speaking i am very sure that conscience only kept edward from harley street i really believe he has most delicate conscience world most scrupulous performing every engagement however minute however it may make against his interest or pleasure he is most fearful giving pain wounding expectation most incapable being selfish any body i ever saw edward it is so i will say it what are you never hear yourself praised then you must be no friend mine for those who will accept my love esteem must submit my open commendation nature her commendation present case however happened be particularly ill suited feelings two thirds her auditors was so very unexhilarating edward that he very soon got up go away going so soon said marianne my dear edward this must not be drawing him little aside she whispered her persuasion that lucy could not stay much longer but even this encouragement failed for he would go lucy who would have outstaid him had his visit lasted two hours soon afterwards went away what can bring her here so often said marianne on her leaving them could not she see that we wanted her gone how teazing edward why so we were all his friends lucy has been longest known him any it is but natural that he should like see her as well as ourselves marianne looked at her steadily said you know elinor that this is kind talking which i cannot bear if you only hope have your assertion contradicted as i must suppose be case you ought recollect that i am last person world do it i cannot descend be tricked out assurances that are not really wanted she then left room elinor dared not follow her say more for bound as she was by her promise secrecy lucy she could give no information that would convince marianne painful as consequences her still continuing error might be she was obliged submit it all that she could hope was that edward would not often expose her or himself distress hearing marianne s mistaken warmth nor repetition any other part pain that had attended their recent meeting this she had every reason expect chapter xxxvi within few days after this meeting newspapers announced world that lady thomas palmer esq was safely delivered son heir very interesting satisfactory paragraph at least all those intimate connections who knew it before this event highly important mrs jennings s happiness produced temporary alteration disposal her time influenced like degree engagements her young friends for as she wished be as much as possible with charlotte she went thither every morning as soon as she was dressed did not return till late evening miss dashwoods at particular request middletons spent whole every day conduit street for their own comfort they would much rather have remained at least all morning mrs jennings s house but it was not thing be urged against wishes everybody their hours were therefore made over lady middleton two miss steeles by whom their company fact was as little valued as it was professedly sought they had too much sense be desirable companions former by latter they were considered with jealous eye as intruding on their ground sharing kindness which they wanted monopolize though nothing could be more polite than lady middleton s behaviour elinor marianne she did not really like them at all because they neither flattered herself nor her children she could not believe them good natured because they were fond reading she fancied them satirical perhaps without exactly knowing what it was be satirical but that did not signify it was censure common use easily given their presence was restraint both on her on lucy it checked idleness one business other lady middleton was ashamed doing nothing before them flattery which lucy was proud think administer at other times she feared they would despise her for offering miss steele was least discomposed three by their presence it was their power reconcile her it entirely would either them only have given her full minute account whole affair between marianne mr willoughby she would have thought herself amply rewarded for sacrifice best place by fire after dinner which their arrival occasioned but this conciliation was not granted for though she often threw out expressions pity for her sister elinor more than once dropt reflection on inconstancy beaux before marianne no effect was produced but look indifference from former or disgust latter effort even yet lighter might have made her their friend would they only have laughed at her about doctor but so little were they any more than others inclined oblige her that if sir john dined from home she might spend whole day without hearing any other raillery on subject than what she was kind enough bestow on herself all these jealousies discontents however were so totally unsuspected by mrs jennings that she thought it delightful thing for girls be together generally congratulated her young friends every night on having escaped company stupid old woman so long she joined them sometimes at sir john s sometimes at her own house but wherever it was she always came excellent spirits full delight importance attributing charlotte s well doing her own care ready give so exact so minute detail her situation as only miss steele had curiosity enough desire one thing did disturb her that she made her daily complaint mr palmer maintained common but unfatherly opinion among his sex all infants being alike though she could plainly perceive at different times most striking resemblance between this baby every one his relations on both sides there was no convincing his father it no persuading him believe that it was not exactly like every other baby same age nor could he even be brought acknowledge simple proposition its being finest child world i come now relation misfortune which about this time befell mrs john dashwood it so happened that while her two sisters with mrs jennings were first calling on her harley street another her acquaintance had dropt circumstance itself not apparently likely produce evil her but while imaginations other people will carry them away form wrong judgments our conduct decide on it by slight appearances one s happiness must some measure be always at mercy chance present instance this last arrived lady allowed her fancy so far outrun truth probability that on merely hearing name miss dashwoods understanding them be mr dashwood s sisters she immediately concluded them be staying harley street this misconstruction produced within day or two afterwards cards invitation for them as well as for their brother sister small musical party at her house consequence which was that mrs john dashwood was obliged submit not only exceedingly great inconvenience sending her carriage for miss dashwoods but what was still worse must be subject all unpleasantness appearing treat them with attention who could tell that they might not expect go out with her second time power disappointing them it was true must always be hers but that was not enough for when people are determined on mode conduct which they know be wrong they feel injured by expectation any thing better from them marianne had now been brought by degrees so much into habit going out every day that it was become matter indifference her whether she went or not she prepared quietly mechanically for every evening s engagement though without expecting smallest amusement from any very often without knowing till last moment where it was take her her dress appearance she was grown so perfectly indifferent as not bestow half consideration on it during whole her toilet which it received from miss steele first five minutes their being together when it was finished nothing escaped her minute observation general curiosity she saw every thing asked every thing was never easy till she knew price every part marianne s dress could have guessed number her gowns altogether with better judgment than marianne herself was not without hopes finding out before they parted how much her washing cost per week how much she had every year spend upon herself impertinence these kind scrutinies moreover was generally concluded with compliment which though meant as its douceur was considered by marianne as greatest impertinence all for after undergoing examination into value make her gown colour her shoes arrangement her hair she was almost sure being told that upon her word she looked vastly smart she dared say she would make great many conquests with such encouragement as this was she dismissed on present occasion her brother s carriage which they were ready enter five minutes after it stopped at door punctuality not very agreeable their sister law who had preceded them house her acquaintance was there hoping for some delay on their part that might inconvenience either herself or her coachman events this evening were not very remarkable party like other musical parties comprehended great many people who had real taste for performance great many more who had none at all performers themselves were as usual their own estimation that their immediate friends first private performers england as elinor was neither musical nor affecting be so she made no scruple turning her eyes from grand pianoforte whenever it suited her unrestrained even by presence harp violoncello would fix them at pleasure on any other object room one these excursive glances she perceived among group young men very he who had given them lecture on toothpick cases at gray s she perceived him soon afterwards looking at herself speaking familiarly her brother had just determined find out his name from latter when they both came towards her mr dashwood introduced him her as mr robert ferrars he addressed her with easy civility twisted his head into bow which assured her as plainly as words could have done that he was exactly coxcomb she had heard him described be by lucy happy had it been for her if her regard for edward had depended less on his own merit than on merit his nearest relations for then his brother s bow must have given finishing stroke what ill humour his mother sister would have begun but while she wondered at difference two young men she did not find that emptiness conceit one put her out all charity with modesty worth other why they were different robert explained her himself course quarter hour s conversation for talking his brother lamenting extreme gaucherie which he really believed kept him from mixing proper society he candidly generously attributed it much less any natural deficiency than misfortune private education while he himself though probably without any particular any material superiority by nature merely from advantage public school was as well fitted mix world as any other man upon my soul he added i believe it is nothing more so i often tell my mother when she is grieving about it my dear madam i always say her you must make yourself easy evil is now irremediable it has been entirely your own doing why would you be persuaded by my uncle sir robert against your own judgment place edward under private tuition at most critical time his life if you had only sent him westminster as well as myself instead sending him mr pratt s all this would have been prevented this is way which i always consider matter my mother is perfectly convinced her error elinor would not oppose his opinion because whatever might be her general estimation advantage public school she could not think edward s abode mr pratt s family with any satisfaction you reside devonshire i think was his next observation cottage near dawlish elinor set him right as its situation it seemed rather surprising him that anybody could live devonshire without living near dawlish he bestowed his hearty approbation however on their species house for my own part said he i am excessively fond cottage there is always so much comfort so much elegance about them i protest if i had any money spare i should buy little land build one myself within short distance london where i might drive myself down at any time collect few friends about me be happy i advise every body who is going build build cottage my friend lord courtland came me other day on purpose ask my advice laid before me three different plans bonomi s i was decide on best them my dear courtland said i immediately throwing them all into fire do not adopt either them but by all means build cottage that i fancy will be end it some people imagine that there can be no accommodations no space cottage but this is all mistake i was last month at my friend elliott s near dartford lady elliott wished give dance but how can it be done said she my dear ferrars do tell me how it is be managed there is not room this cottage that will hold ten couple where can supper be i immediately saw that there could be no difficulty it so i said my dear lady elliott do not be uneasy dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease card tables may be placed drawing room library may be open for tea other refreshments let supper be set out saloon lady elliott was delighted with thought we measured dining room found it would hold exactly eighteen couple affair was arranged precisely after my plan so that fact you see if people do but know how set about it every comfort may be as well enjoyed cottage as most spacious dwelling elinor agreed it all for she did not think he deserved compliment rational opposition as john dashwood had no more pleasure music than his eldest sister his mind was equally at liberty fix on any thing else thought struck him during evening which he communicated his wife for her approbation when they got home consideration mrs dennison s mistake supposing his sisters their guests had suggested propriety their being really invited become such while mrs jennings s engagements kept her from home expense would be nothing inconvenience not more it was altogether attention which delicacy his conscience pointed out be requisite its complete enfranchisement from his promise his father fanny was startled at proposal i do not see how it can be done said she without affronting lady middleton for they spend every day with her otherwise i should be exceedingly glad do it you know i am always ready pay them any attention my power as my taking them out this evening shows but they are lady middleton s visitors how can i ask them away from her her husband but with great humility did not see force her objection they had already spent week this manner conduit street lady middleton could not be displeased at their giving same number days such near relations fanny paused moment then with fresh vigor said my love i would ask them with all my heart if it was my power but i had just settled within myself ask miss steeles spend few days with us they are very well behaved good kind girls i think attention is due them as their uncle did so very well by edward we can ask your sisters some other year you know but miss steeles may not be town any more i am sure you will like them indeed you do like them you know very much already so does my mother they are such favourites with harry mr dashwood was convinced he saw necessity inviting miss steeles immediately his conscience was pacified by resolution inviting his sisters another year at same time however slyly suspecting that another year would make invitation needless by bringing elinor town as colonel brandon s wife marianne as their visitor fanny rejoicing her escape proud ready wit that had procured it wrote next morning lucy request her company her sister s for some days harley street as soon as lady middleton could spare them this was enough make lucy really reasonably happy mrs dashwood seemed actually working for her herself cherishing all her hopes promoting all her views such opportunity being with edward his family was above all things most material her interest such invitation most gratifying her feelings it was advantage that could not be too gratefully acknowledged nor too speedily made use visit lady middleton which had not before had any precise limits was instantly discovered have been always meant end two days time when note was shown elinor as it was within ten minutes after its arrival it gave her for first time some share expectations lucy for such mark uncommon kindness vouchsafed on so short acquaintance seemed declare that good will towards her arose from something more than merely malice against herself might be brought by time address do every thing that lucy wished her flattery had already subdued pride lady middleton made entry into close heart mrs john dashwood these were effects that laid open probability greater miss steeles removed harley street all that reached elinor their influence there strengthened her expectation event sir john who called on them more than once brought home such accounts favour they were as must be universally striking mrs dashwood had never been so much pleased with any young women her life as she was with them had given each them needle book made by some emigrant called lucy by her christian name did not know whether she should ever be able part with them end second volume chapter xxxvii mrs palmer was so well at end fortnight that her mother felt it no longer necessary give up whole her time her contenting herself with visiting her once or twice day returned from that period her own home her own habits which she found miss dashwoods very ready resume their former share about third or fourth morning after their being thus resettled berkeley street mrs jennings on returning from her ordinary visit mrs palmer entered drawing room where elinor was sitting by herself with air such hurrying importance as prepared her hear something wonderful giving her time only form that idea began directly justify it by saying lord my dear miss dashwood have you heard news no ma am what is it something so strange but you shall hear it all when i got mr palmer s i found charlotte quite fuss about child she was sure it was very ill it cried fretted was all over pimples so i looked at it directly lord my dear says i it is nothing world but red gum nurse said just same but charlotte she would not be satisfied so mr donavan was sent for luckily he happened just come from harley street so he stepped over directly as soon as ever he saw child he said just as we did that it was nothing world but red gum then charlotte was easy so just as he was going away again it came into my head i am sure i do not know how i happened think it but it came into my head ask him if there was any news so upon that he smirked simpered looked grave seemed know something or other at last he said whisper for fear any unpleasant report should reach young ladies under your care as their sister s indisposition i think it advisable say that i believe there is no great reason for alarm i hope mrs dashwood will do very well what is fanny ill that is exactly what i said my dear lord says i is mrs dashwood ill so then it all came out long short matter by all i can learn seems be this mr edward ferrars very young man i used joke with you about but however as it turns out i am monstrous glad there was never any thing it mr edward ferrars it seems has been engaged above this twelvemonth my cousin lucy there s for you my dear not creature knowing syllable matter except nancy could you have believed such thing possible there is no great wonder their liking one another but that matters should be brought so forward between them nobody suspect it that is strange i never happened see them together or i am sure i should have found it out directly well so this was kept great secret for fear mrs ferrars neither she nor your brother or sister suspected word matter till this very morning poor nancy who you know is well meaning creature but no conjurer popt it all out lord thinks she herself they are all so fond lucy be sure they will make no difficulty about it so away she went your sister who was sitting all alone at her carpet work little suspecting what was come for she had just been saying your brother only five minutes before that she thought make match between edward some lord s daughter or other i forget who so you may think what blow it was all her vanity pride she fell into violent hysterics immediately with such screams as reached your brother s ears as he was sitting his own dressing room down stairs thinking about writing letter his steward country so up he flew directly terrible scene took place for lucy was come them by that time little dreaming what was going on poor soul i pity her i must say i think she was used very hardly for your sister scolded like any fury soon drove her into fainting fit nancy she fell upon her knees cried bitterly your brother he walked about room said he did not know what do mrs dashwood declared they should not stay minute longer house your brother was forced go down upon his knees too persuade her let them stay till they had packed up their clothes then she fell into hysterics again he was so frightened that he would send for mr donavan mr donavan found house all this uproar carriage was at door ready take my poor cousins away they were just stepping as he came off poor lucy such condition he says she could hardly walk nancy she was almost as bad i declare i have no patience with your sister i hope with all my heart it will be match spite her lord what taking poor mr edward will be when he hears it have his love used so scornfully for they say he is monstrous fond her as well he may i should not wonder if he was be greatest passion mr donavan thinks just same he i had great deal talk about it best all is that he is gone back again harley street that he may be within call when mrs ferrars is told it for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left house for your sister was sure she would be hysterics too so she may for what i care i have no pity for either them i have no notion people s making such do about money greatness there is no reason on earth why mr edward lucy should not marry for i am sure mrs ferrars may afford do very well by her son though lucy has next nothing herself she knows better than any body how make most every thing i dare say if mrs ferrars would only allow him five hundred year she would make as good appearance with it as any body else would with eight lord how snug they might live such another cottage as yours or little bigger with two maids two men i believe i could help them housemaid for my betty has sister out place that would fit them exactly here mrs jennings ceased as elinor had had time enough collect her thoughts she was able give such answer make such observations as subject might naturally be supposed produce happy find that she was not suspected any extraordinary interest it that mrs jennings as she had late often hoped might be case had ceased imagine her at all attached edward happy above all rest absence marianne she felt very well able speak affair without embarrassment give her judgment as she believed with impartiality on conduct every one concerned it she could hardly determine what her own expectation its event really was though she earnestly tried drive away notion its being possible end otherwise at last than marriage edward lucy what mrs ferrars would say do though there could not be doubt its nature she was anxious hear still more anxious know how edward would conduct himself for him she felt much compassion for lucy very little it cost her some pains procure that little for rest party none at all as mrs jennings could talk on no other subject elinor soon saw necessity preparing marianne for its discussion no time was be lost undeceiving her making her acquainted with real truth endeavouring bring her hear it talked by others without betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister or any resentment against edward elinor s office was painful one she was going remove what she really believed be her sister s chief consolation give such particulars edward as she feared would ruin him for ever her good opinion make marianne by resemblance their situations which her fancy would seem strong feel all her own disappointment over again but unwelcome as such task must be it was necessary be done elinor therefore hastened perform it she was very far from wishing dwell on her own feelings or represent herself as suffering much any otherwise than as self command she had practised since her first knowledge edward s engagement might suggest hint what was practicable marianne her narration was clear simple though it could not be given without emotion it was not accompanied by violent agitation nor impetuous grief that belonged rather hearer for marianne listened with horror cried excessively elinor was be comforter others her own distresses no less than theirs all comfort that could be given by assurances her own composure mind very earnest vindication edward from every charge but imprudence was readily offered but marianne for some time would give credit neither edward seemed second willoughby acknowledging as elinor did that she had loved him most sincerely could she feel less than herself as for lucy steele she considered her so totally unamiable so absolutely incapable attaching sensible man that she could not be persuaded at first believe afterwards pardon any former affection edward for her she would not even admit it have been natural elinor left her be convinced that it was so by that which only could convince her better knowledge mankind her first communication had reached no farther than state fact engagement length time it had existed marianne s feelings had then broken put end all regularity detail for some time all that could be done was soothe her distress lessen her alarms combat her resentment first question on her side which led farther particulars was how long has this been known you elinor has he written you i have known it these four months when lucy first came barton park last november she told me confidence her engagement at these words marianne s eyes expressed astonishment which her lips could not utter after pause wonder she exclaimed four months have you known this four months elinor confirmed it what while attending me all my misery has this been on your heart i have reproached you for being happy it was not fit that you should then know how much i was reverse four months cried marianne again so calm so cheerful how have you been supported by feeling that i was doing my duty my promise lucy obliged me be secret i owed it her therefore avoid giving any hint truth i owed it my family friends not create them solicitude about me which it could not be my power satisfy marianne seemed much struck i have very often wished undeceive yourself my mother added elinor once or twice i have attempted it but without betraying my trust i never could have convinced you four months yet you loved him yes but i did not love only him while comfort others was dear me i was glad spare them from knowing how much i felt now i can think speak it with little emotion i would not have you suffer on my account for i assure you i no longer suffer materially myself i have many things support me i am not conscious having provoked disappointment by any imprudence my own i have borne it as much as possible without spreading it farther i acquit edward essential misconduct i wish him very happy i am so sure his always doing his duty that though now he may harbour some regret end he must become so lucy does not want sense that is foundation on which every thing good may be built after all marianne after all that is bewitching idea single constant attachment all that can be said one s happiness depending entirely on any particular person it is not meant it is not fit it is not possible that it should be so edward will marry lucy he will marry woman superior person understanding half her sex time habit will teach him forget that he ever thought another superior her if such is your way thinking said marianne if loss what is most valued is so easily be made up by something else your resolution your self command are perhaps little less be wondered at they are brought more within my comprehension i understand you you do not suppose that i have ever felt much for four months marianne i have had all this hanging on my mind without being at liberty speak it single creature knowing that it would make you my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained you yet unable prepare you for it least it was told me it was manner forced on me by very person herself whose prior engagement ruined all my prospects told me as i thought with triumph this person s suspicions therefore i have had oppose by endeavouring appear indifferent where i have been most deeply interested it has not been only once i have had her hopes exultation listen again again i have known myself be divided from edward for ever without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire connection nothing has proved him unworthy nor has anything declared him indifferent me i have had contend against unkindness his sister insolence his mother have suffered punishment attachment without enjoying its advantages all this has been going on at time when as you know too well it has not been my only unhappiness if you can think me capable ever feeling surely you may suppose that i have suffered now composure mind with which i have brought myself at present consider matter consolation that i have been willing admit have been effect constant painful exertion they did not spring up themselves they did not occur relieve my spirits at first no marianne then if i had not been bound silence perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely not even what i owed my dearest friends from openly showing that i was very unhappy marianne was quite subdued oh elinor she cried you have made me hate myself for ever how barbarous have i been you you who have been my only comfort who have borne with me all my misery who have seemed be only suffering for me is this my gratitude is this only return i can make you because your merit cries out upon myself i have been trying do it away tenderest caresses followed this confession such frame mind as she was now elinor had no difficulty obtaining from her whatever promise she required at her request marianne engaged never speak affair any one with least appearance bitterness meet lucy without betraying smallest increase dislike her even see edward himself if chance should bring them together without any diminution her usual cordiality these were great concessions but where marianne felt that she had injured no reparation could be too much for her make she performed her promise being discreet admiration she attended all that mrs jennings had say upon subject with unchanging complexion dissented from her nothing was heard three times say yes ma am she listened her praise lucy with only moving from one chair another when mrs jennings talked edward s affection it cost her only spasm her throat such advances towards heroism her sister made elinor feel equal any thing herself next morning brought farther trial it visit from their brother who came with most serious aspect talk over dreadful affair bring them news his wife you have heard i suppose said he with great solemnity as soon as he was seated very shocking discovery that took place under our roof yesterday they all looked their assent it seemed too awful moment for speech your sister he continued has suffered dreadfully mrs ferrars too short it has been scene such complicated distress but i will hope that storm may be weathered without our being any us quite overcome poor fanny she was hysterics all yesterday but i would not alarm you too much donavan says there is nothing materially be apprehended her constitution is good one her resolution equal any thing she has borne it all with fortitude angel she says she never shall think well anybody again one cannot wonder at it after being so deceived meeting with such ingratitude where so much kindness had been shown so much confidence had been placed it was quite out benevolence her heart that she had asked these young women her house merely because she thought they deserved some attention were harmless well behaved girls would be pleasant companions for otherwise we both wished very much have invited you marianne be with us while your kind friend there was attending her daughter now be so rewarded i wish with all my heart says poor fanny her affectionate way that we had asked your sisters instead them here he stopped be thanked which being done he went on what poor mrs ferrars suffered when first fanny broke it her is not be described while she with truest affection had been planning most eligible connection for him was it be supposed that he could be all time secretly engaged another person such suspicion could never have entered her head if she suspected any prepossession elsewhere it could not be that quarter there be sure said she i might have thought myself safe she was quite agony we consulted together however as what should be done at last she determined send for edward he came but i am sorry relate what ensued all that mrs ferrars could say make him put end engagement assisted too as you may well suppose by my arguments fanny s entreaties was no avail duty affection every thing was disregarded i never thought edward so stubborn so unfeeling before his mother explained him her liberal designs case his marrying miss morton told him she would settle on him norfolk estate which clear land tax brings good thousand year offered even when matters grew desperate make it twelve hundred opposition this if he still persisted this low connection represented him certain penury that must attend match his own two thousand pounds she protested should be his all she would never see him again so far would she be from affording him smallest assistance that if he were enter into any profession with view better support she would do all her power prevent him advancing it here marianne ecstasy indignation clapped her hands together cried gracious god can this be possible well may you wonder marianne replied her brother at obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these your exclamation is very natural marianne was going retort but she remembered her promises forbore all this however he continued was urged vain edward said very little but what he did say was most determined manner nothing should prevail on him give up his engagement he would stand it cost him what it might then cried mrs jennings with blunt sincerity no longer able be silent he has acted like honest man i beg your pardon mr dashwood but if he had done otherwise i should have thought him rascal i have some little concern business as well as yourself for lucy steele is my cousin i believe there is not better kind girl world nor one who more deserves good husband john dashwood was greatly astonished but his nature was calm not open provocation he never wished offend anybody especially anybody good fortune he therefore replied without any resentment i would by no means speak disrespectfully any relation yours madam miss lucy steele is i dare say very deserving young woman but present case you know connection must be impossible have entered into secret engagement with young man under her uncle s care son woman especially such very large fortune as mrs ferrars is perhaps altogether little extraordinary short i do not mean reflect upon behaviour any person whom you have regard for mrs jennings we all wish her extremely happy mrs ferrars s conduct throughout whole has been such as every conscientious good mother like circumstances would adopt it has been dignified liberal edward has drawn his own lot i fear it will be bad one marianne sighed out her similar apprehension elinor s heart wrung for feelings edward while braving his mother s threats for woman who could not reward him well sir said mrs jennings how did it end i am sorry say ma am most unhappy rupture edward is dismissed for ever from his mother s notice he left her house yesterday but where he is gone or whether he is still town i do not know for we course can make no inquiry poor young man what is become him what indeed ma am it is melancholy consideration born prospect such affluence i cannot conceive situation more deplorable interest two thousand pounds how can man live on it when that is added recollection that he might but for his own folly within three months have been receipt two thousand five hundred year for miss morton has thirty thousand pounds i cannot picture myself more wretched condition we must all feel for him more so because it is totally out our power assist him poor young man cried mrs jennings i am sure he should be very welcome bed board at my house so i would tell him if i could see him it is not fit that he should be living about at his own charge now at lodgings taverns elinor s heart thanked her for such kindness towards edward though she could not forbear smiling at form it if he would only have done as well by himself said john dashwood as all his friends were disposed do by him he might now have been his proper situation would have wanted for nothing but as it is it must be out anybody s power assist him there is one thing more preparing against him which must be worse than all his mother has determined with very natural kind spirit settle that estate upon robert immediately which might have been edward s on proper conditions i left her this morning with her lawyer talking over business well said mrs jennings that is her revenge everybody has way their own but i don t think mine would be make one son independent because another had plagued me marianne got up walked about room can anything be more galling spirit man continued john than see his younger brother possession estate which might have been his own poor edward i feel for him sincerely few minutes more spent same kind effusion concluded his visit with repeated assurances his sisters that he really believed there was no material danger fanny s indisposition that they need not therefore be very uneasy about it he went away leaving three ladies unanimous their sentiments on present occasion as far at least as it regarded mrs ferrars s conduct dashwoods edward s marianne s indignation burst forth as soon as he quitted room as her vehemence made reserve impossible elinor unnecessary mrs jennings they all joined very spirited critique upon party chapter xxxviii mrs jennings was very warm her praise edward s conduct but only elinor marianne understood its true merit they only knew how little he had had tempt him be disobedient how small was consolation beyond consciousness doing right that could remain him loss friends fortune elinor gloried his integrity marianne forgave all his offences compassion for his punishment but though confidence between them was by this public discovery restored its proper state it was not subject on which either them were fond dwelling when alone elinor avoided it upon principle as tending fix still more upon her thoughts by too warm too positive assurances marianne that belief edward s continued affection for herself which she rather wished do away marianne s courage soon failed her trying converse upon topic which always left her more dissatisfied with herself than ever by comparison it necessarily produced between elinor s conduct her own she felt all force that comparison but not as her sister had hoped urge her exertion now she felt it with all pain continual self reproach regretted most bitterly that she had never exerted herself before but it brought only torture penitence without hope amendment her mind was so much weakened that she still fancied present exertion impossible therefore it only dispirited her more nothing new was heard by them for day or two afterwards affairs harley street or bartlett s buildings but though so much matter was known them already that mrs jennings might have had enough do spreading that knowledge farther without seeking after more she had resolved from first pay visit comfort inquiry her cousins as soon as she could nothing but hindrance more visitors than usual had prevented her going them within that time third day succeeding their knowledge particulars was so fine so beautiful sunday as draw many kensington gardens though it was only second week march mrs jennings elinor were number but marianne who knew that willoughbys were again town had constant dread meeting them chose rather stay at home than venture into so public place intimate acquaintance mrs jennings joined them soon after they entered gardens elinor was not sorry that by her continuing with them engaging all mrs jennings s conversation she was herself left quiet reflection she saw nothing willoughbys nothing edward for some time nothing anybody who could by any chance whether grave or gay be interesting her but at last she found herself with some surprise accosted by miss steele who though looking rather shy expressed great satisfaction meeting them on receiving encouragement from particular kindness mrs jennings left her own party for short time join their s mrs jennings immediately whispered elinor get it all out her my dear she will tell you any thing if you ask you see i cannot leave mrs clarke it was lucky however for mrs jennings s curiosity elinor s too that she would tell any thing without being asked for nothing would otherwise have been learnt i am so glad meet you said miss steele taking her familiarly by arm for i wanted see you all things world then lowering her voice i suppose mrs jennings has heard all about it is she angry not at all i believe with you that is good thing lady middleton is she angry i cannot suppose it possible that she should be i am monstrous glad it good gracious i have had such time it i never saw lucy such rage my life she vowed at first she would never trim me up new bonnet nor do any thing else for me again so long as she lived but now she is quite come we are as good friends as ever look she made me this bow my hat put feather last night there now you are going laugh at me too but why should not i wear pink ribbons i do not care if it is doctor s favourite colour i am sure for my part i should never have known he did like it better than any other colour if he had not happened say so my cousins have been so plaguing me i declare sometimes i do not know which way look before them she had wandered away subject on which elinor had nothing say therefore soon judged it expedient find her way back again first well but miss dashwood speaking triumphantly people may say what they chuse about mr ferrars s declaring he would not have lucy for it is no such thing i can tell you it is quite shame for such ill natured reports be spread abroad whatever lucy might think about it herself you know it was no business other people set it down for certain i never heard any thing kind hinted at before i assure you said elinor oh did not you but it was said i know very well by more than one for miss godby told miss sparks that nobody their senses could expect mr ferrars give up woman like miss morton with thirty thousand pounds her fortune for lucy steele that had nothing at all i had it from miss sparks myself besides that my cousin richard said himself that when it came point he was afraid mr ferrars would be off when edward did not come near us for three days i could not tell what think myself i believe my heart lucy gave it up all for lost for we came away from your brother s wednesday we saw nothing him not all thursday friday saturday did not know what was become him once lucy thought write him but then her spirits rose against that however this morning he came just as we came home from church then it all came out how he had been sent for wednesday harley street been talked by his mother all them how he had declared before them all that he loved nobody but lucy nobody but lucy would he have how he had been so worried by what passed that as soon as he had went away from his mother s house he had got upon his horse rid into country some where or other how he had stayed about at inn all thursday friday on purpose get better it after thinking it all over over again he said it seemed him as if now he had no fortune no nothing at all it would be quite unkind keep her on engagement because it must be for her loss for he had nothing but two thousand pounds no hope any thing else if he was go into orders as he had some thoughts he could get nothing but curacy how was they live upon that he could not bear think her doing no better so he begged if she had least mind for it put end matter directly leave him shift for himself i heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be it was entirely for her sake upon her account that he said word about being off not upon his own i will take my oath he never dropt syllable being tired her or wishing marry miss morton or any thing like it but be sure lucy would not give ear such kind talking so she told him directly with great deal about sweet love you know all that oh la one can t repeat such kind things you know she told him directly she had not least mind world be off for she could live with him upon trifle how little so ever he might have she should be very glad have it all you know or something kind so then he was monstrous happy talked on some time about what they should do they agreed he should take orders directly they must wait be married till he got living just then i could not hear any more for my cousin called from below tell me mrs richardson was come her coach would take one us kensington gardens so i was forced go into room interrupt them ask lucy if she would like go but she did not care leave edward so i just run up stairs put on pair silk stockings came off with richardsons i do not understand what you mean by interrupting them said elinor you were all same room together were not you no indeed not us la miss dashwood do you think people make love when any body else is by oh for shame be sure you must know better than that laughing affectedly no no they were shut up drawing room together all i heard was only by listening at door how cried elinor have you been repeating me what you only learnt yourself by listening at door i am sorry i did not know it before for i certainly would not have suffered you give me particulars conversation which you ought not have known yourself how could you behave so unfairly by your sister oh la there is nothing that i only stood at door heard what i could i am sure lucy would have done just same by me for year or two back when martha sharpe i had so many secrets together she never made any bones hiding closet or behind chimney board on purpose hear what we said elinor tried talk something else but miss steele could not be kept beyond couple minutes from what was uppermost her mind edward talks going oxford soon said she but now he is lodging at no pall mall what ill natured woman his mother is t she your brother sister were not very kind however i shan t say anything against them you be sure they did send us home their own chariot which was more than i looked for for my part i was all fright for fear your sister should ask us for huswifes she had gave us day or two before but however nothing was said about them i took care keep mine out sight edward have got some business at oxford he says so he must go there for time after that as soon as he can light upon bishop he will be ordained i wonder what curacy he will get good gracious giggling as she spoke i d lay my life i know what my cousins will say when they hear it they will tell me i should write doctor get edward curacy his new living i know they will but i am sure i would not do such thing for all world la i shall say directly i wonder how you could think such thing i write doctor indeed well said elinor it is comfort be prepared against worst you have got your answer ready miss steele was going reply on same subject but approach her own party made another more necessary oh la here come richardsons i had vast deal more say you but i must not stay away from them not any longer i assure you they are very genteel people he makes monstrous deal money they keep their own coach i have not time speak mrs jennings about it myself but pray tell her i am quite happy hear she is not anger against us lady middleton same if anything should happen take you your sister away mrs jennings should want company i am sure we should be very glad come stay with her for as long time as she likes i suppose lady middleton won t ask us any more this bout good by i am sorry miss marianne was not here remember me kindly her la if you have not got your spotted muslin on i wonder you was not afraid its being torn such was her parting concern for after this she had time only pay her farewell compliments mrs jennings before her company was claimed by mrs richardson elinor was left possession knowledge which might feed her powers reflection some time though she had learnt very little more than what had been already foreseen foreplanned her own mind edward s marriage with lucy was as firmly determined on time its taking place remained as absolutely uncertain as she had concluded it would be every thing depended exactly after her expectation on his getting that preferment which at present there seemed not smallest chance as soon as they returned carriage mrs jennings was eager for information but as elinor wished spread as little as possible intelligence that had first place been so unfairly obtained she confined herself brief repetition such simple particulars as she felt assured that lucy for sake her own consequence would choose have known continuance their engagement means that were able be taken for promoting its end was all her communication this produced from mrs jennings following natural remark wait for his having living ay we all know how that will end they will wait twelvemonth finding no good comes it will set down upon curacy fifty pounds year with interest his

marianne s impatience be gone increased every day she sighed for air liberty quiet country fancied that if any place could give her ease barton must do it elinor was hardly less anxious than herself for their removal only so much less bent on its being effected immediately as that she was conscious difficulties so long journey which marianne could not be brought acknowledge she began however seriously turn her thoughts towards its accomplishment had already mentioned their wishes their kind hostess who resisted them with all eloquence her good will when plan was suggested which though detaining them from home yet few weeks longer appeared elinor altogether much more eligible than any other palmers were remove cleveland about end march for easter holidays mrs jennings with both her friends received very warm invitation from charlotte go with them this would not itself have been sufficient for delicacy miss dashwood but it was inforced with so much real politeness by mr palmer himself as joined very great amendment his manners towards them since her sister had been known be unhappy induced her accept it with pleasure when she told marianne what she had done however her first reply was not very auspicious cleveland she cried with great agitation no i cannot go cleveland you forget said elinor gently that its situation is not that it is not neighbourhood but it is somersetshire i cannot go into somersetshire there where i looked forward going no elinor you cannot expect me go there elinor would not argue upon propriety overcoming such feelings she only endeavoured counteract them by working on others represented it therefore as measure which would fix time her returning that dear mother whom she so much wished see more eligible more comfortable manner than any other plan could do perhaps without any greater delay from cleveland which was within few miles bristol distance barton was not beyond one day though long day s journey their mother s servant might easily come there attend them down as there could be no occasion their staying above week at cleveland they might now be at home little more than three weeks time as marianne s affection for her mother was sincere it must triumph with little difficulty over imaginary evils she had started mrs jennings was so far from being weary her guests that she pressed them very earnestly return with her again from cleveland elinor was grateful for attention but it could not alter her design their mother s concurrence being readily gained every thing relative their return was arranged as far as it could be marianne found some relief drawing up statement hours that were yet divide her from barton ah colonel i do not know what you i shall do without miss dashwoods was mrs jennings s address him when he first called on her after their leaving her was settled for they are quite resolved upon going home from palmers how forlorn we shall be when i come back lord we shall sit gape at one another as dull as two cats perhaps mrs jennings was hopes by this vigorous sketch their future ennui provoke him make that offer which might give himself escape from it if so she had soon afterwards good reason think her object gained for on elinor s moving window take more expeditiously dimensions print which she was going copy for her friend he followed her it with look particular meaning conversed with her there for several minutes effect his discourse on lady too could not escape her observation for though she was too honorable listen had even changed her seat on purpose that she might not hear one close by piano forte on which marianne was playing she could not keep herself from seeing that elinor changed colour attended with agitation was too intent on what he said pursue her employment still farther confirmation her hopes interval marianne s turning from one lesson another some words colonel s inevitably reached her ear which he seemed be apologising for badness his house this set matter beyond doubt she wondered indeed at his thinking it necessary do so but supposed it be proper etiquette what elinor said reply she could not distinguish but judged from motion her lips that she did not think that any material objection mrs jennings commended her her heart for being so honest they then talked on for few minutes longer without her catching syllable when another lucky stop marianne s performance brought her these words colonel s calm voice i am afraid it cannot take place very soon astonished shocked at so unlover like speech she was almost ready cry out lord what should hinder it but checking her desire confined herself this silent ejaculation this is very strange sure he need not wait be older this delay on colonel s side however did not seem offend or mortify his fair companion least for on their breaking up conference soon afterwards moving different ways mrs jennings very plainly heard elinor say with voice which showed her feel what she said i shall always think myself very much obliged you mrs jennings was delighted with her gratitude only wondered that after hearing such sentence colonel should be able take leave them as he immediately did with utmost sang froid go away without making her any reply she had not thought her old friend could have made so indifferent suitor what had really passed between them was this effect i have heard said he with great compassion injustice your friend mr ferrars has suffered from his family for if i understand matter right he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering his engagement with very deserving young woman have i been rightly informed is it so elinor told him that it was cruelty impolitic cruelty he replied with great feeling dividing or attempting divide two young people long attached each other is terrible mrs ferrars does not know what she may be doing what she may drive her son i have seen mr ferrars two or three times harley street am much pleased with him he is not young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted short time but i have seen enough him wish him well for his own sake as friend yours i wish it still more i understand that he intends take orders will you be so good as tell him that living delaford now just vacant as i am informed by this day s post is his if he think it worth his acceptance but that perhaps so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now it may be nonsense appear doubt i only wish it were more valuable it is rectory but small one late incumbent i believe did not make more than 200 per annum though it is certainly capable improvement i fear not such amount as afford him very comfortable income such as it is however my pleasure presenting it him will be very great pray assure him it elinor s astonishment at this commission could hardly have been greater had colonel been really making her offer his hand preferment which only two days before she had considered as hopeless for edward was already provided enable him marry she all people world was fixed on bestow it her emotion was such as mrs jennings had attributed very different cause but whatever minor feelings less pure less pleasing might have share that emotion her esteem for general benevolence her gratitude for particular friendship which together prompted colonel brandon this act were strongly felt warmly expressed she thanked him for it with all her heart spoke edward s principles disposition with that praise which she knew them deserve promised undertake commission with pleasure if it were really his wish put off so agreeable office another but at same time she could not help thinking that no one could so well perform it as himself it was office short from which unwilling give edward pain receiving obligation from her she would have been very glad be spared herself but colonel brandon on motives equal delicacy declining it likewise still seemed so desirous its being given through her means that she would not on any account make farther opposition edward she believed was still town fortunately she had heard his address from miss steele she could undertake therefore inform him it course day after this had been settled colonel brandon began talk his own advantage securing so respectable agreeable neighbour then it was that he mentioned with regret that house was small indifferent evil which elinor as mrs jennings had supposed her do made very light at least as far as regarded its size smallness house said she i cannot imagine any inconvenience them for it will be proportion their family income by which colonel was surprised find that she was considering mr ferrars s marriage as certain consequence presentation for he did not suppose it possible that delaford living could supply such income as anybody his style life would venture settle on he said so this little rectory can do no more than make mr ferrars comfortable as bachelor it cannot enable him marry i am sorry say that my patronage ends with this my interest is hardly more extensive if however by unforeseen chance it should be my power serve him farther i must think very differently him from what i now do if i am not as ready be useful him then as i sincerely wish i could be at present what i am now doing indeed seems nothing at all since it can advance him so little towards what must be his principal his only object happiness his marriage must still be distant good at least i am afraid it cannot take place very soon such was sentence which when misunderstood so justly offended delicate feelings mrs jennings but after this narration what really passed between colonel brandon elinor while they stood at window gratitude expressed by latter on their parting may perhaps appear general not less reasonably excited nor less properly worded than if it had arisen from offer marriage chapter xl well miss dashwood said mrs jennings sagaciously smiling as soon as gentleman had withdrawn i do not ask you what colonel has been saying you for though upon my honour i tried keep out hearing i could not help catching enough understand his business i assure you i never was better pleased my life i wish you joy it with all my heart thank you ma am said elinor it is matter great joy me i feel goodness colonel brandon most sensibly there are not many men who would act as he has done few people who have so compassionate heart i never was more astonished my life lord my dear you are very modest i t least astonished at it world for i have often thought late there was nothing more likely happen you judged from your knowledge colonel s general benevolence but at least you could not foresee that opportunity would so very soon occur opportunity repeated mrs jennings oh as that when man has once made up his mind such thing somehow or other he will soon find opportunity well my dear i wish you joy it again again if ever there was happy couple world i think i shall soon know where look for them you mean go delaford after them i suppose said elinor with faint smile aye my dear that i do indeed as house being bad one i do not know what colonel would be at for it is as good one as ever i saw he spoke its being out repair well whose fault is that why don t he repair it who should do it but himself they were interrupted by servant s coming announce carriage being at door mrs jennings immediately preparing go said well my dear i must be gone before i have had half my talk out but however we may have it all over evening for we shall be quite alone i do not ask you go with me for i dare say your mind is too full matter care for company besides you must long tell your sister all about it marianne had left room before conversation began certainly ma am i shall tell marianne it but i shall not mention it at present any body else oh very well said mrs jennings rather disappointed then you would not have me tell it lucy for i think going as far as holborn day no ma am not even lucy if you please one day s delay will not be very material till i have written mr ferrars i think it ought not be mentioned any body else i shall do that directly it is importance that no time should be lost with him for he will course have much do relative his ordination this speech at first puzzled mrs jennings exceedingly why mr ferrars was have been written about it such hurry she could not immediately comprehend few moments reflection however produced very happy idea she exclaimed oh ho i understand you mr ferrars is be man well so much better for him ay be sure he must be ordained readiness i am very glad find things are so forward between you but my dear is not this rather out character should not colonel write himself sure he is proper person elinor did not quite understand beginning mrs jennings s speech neither did she think it worth inquiring into therefore only replied its conclusion colonel brandon is so delicate man that he rather wished any one announce his intentions mr ferrars than himself so you are forced do it well that is odd kind delicacy however i will not disturb you seeing her preparing write you know your own concerns best so goodby my dear i have not heard any thing please me so well since charlotte was brought bed away she went but returning again moment i have just been thinking betty s sister my dear i should be very glad get her so good mistress but whether she would do for lady s maid i am sure i can t tell she is excellent housemaid works very well at her needle however you will think all that at your leisure certainly ma am replied elinor not hearing much what she said more anxious be alone than be mistress subject how she should begin how she should express herself her note edward was now all her concern particular circumstances between them made difficulty that which any other person would have been easiest thing world but she equally feared say too much or too little sat deliberating over her paper with pen her hand till broken on by entrance edward himself he had met mrs jennings at door her way carriage as he came leave his farewell card she after apologising for not returning herself had obliged him enter by saying that miss dashwood was above wanted speak with him on very particular business elinor had just been congratulating herself midst her perplexity that however difficult it might be express herself properly by letter it was at least preferable giving information by word mouth when her visitor entered force her upon this greatest exertion all her astonishment confusion were very great on his so sudden appearance she had not seen him before since his engagement became public therefore not since his knowing her be acquainted with it which with consciousness what she had been thinking what she had tell him made her feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes he too was much distressed they sat down together most promising state embarrassment whether he had asked her pardon for his intrusion on first coming into room he could not recollect but determining be on safe side he made his apology form as soon as he could say any thing after taking chair mrs jennings told me said he that you wished speak with me at least i understood her so or i certainly should not have intruded on you such manner though at same time i should have been extremely sorry leave london without seeing you your sister especially as it will most likely be some time it is not probable that i should soon have pleasure meeting you again i go oxford tomorrow you would not have gone however said elinor recovering herself determined get over what she so much dreaded as soon as possible without receiving our good wishes even if we had not been able give them person mrs jennings was quite right what she said i have something consequence inform you which i was on point communicating by paper i am charged with most agreeable office breathing rather faster than usual as she spoke colonel brandon who was here only ten minutes ago has desired me say that understanding you mean take orders he has great pleasure offering you living delaford now just vacant only wishes it were more valuable allow me congratulate you on having so respectable well judging friend join his wish that living it is about two hundred year were much more considerable such as might better enable you as might be more than temporary accommodation yourself such short as might establish all your views happiness what edward felt as he could not say it himself it cannot be expected that any one else should say for him he looked all astonishment which such unexpected such unthought information could not fail exciting but he said only these two words colonel brandon yes continued elinor gathering more resolution as some worst was over colonel brandon means it as testimony his concern for what has lately passed for cruel situation which unjustifiable conduct your family has placed you concern which i am sure marianne myself all your friends must share likewise as proof his high esteem for your general character his particular approbation your behaviour on present occasion colonel brandon give me living can it be possible unkindness your own relations has made you astonished find friendship any where no replied he with sudden consciousness not find it you for i cannot be ignorant that you your goodness i owe it all i feel it i would express it if i could but as you well know i am no orator you are very much mistaken i do assure you that you owe it entirely at least almost entirely your own merit colonel brandon s discernment it i have had no hand it i did not even know till i understood his design that living was vacant nor had it ever occurred me that he might have had such living his gift as friend mine my family he may perhaps indeed i know he has still greater pleasure bestowing it but upon my word you owe nothing my solicitation truth obliged her acknowledge some small share action but she was at same time so unwilling appear as benefactress edward that she acknowledged it with hesitation which probably contributed fix that suspicion his mind which had recently entered it for short time he sat deep thought after elinor had ceased speak at last as if it were rather effort he said colonel brandon seems man great worth respectability i have always heard him spoken as such your brother i know esteems him highly he is undoubtedly sensible man his manners perfectly gentleman indeed replied elinor i believe that you will find him on farther acquaintance all that you have heard him be as you will be such very near neighbours for i understand parsonage is almost close mansion house it is particularly important that he should be all this edward made no answer but when she had turned away her head gave her look so serious so earnest so uncheerful as seemed say that he might hereafter wish distance between parsonage mansion house much greater colonel brandon i think lodges st james street said he soon afterwards rising from his chair elinor told him number house i must hurry away then give him those thanks which you will not allow me give you assure him that he has made me very exceedingly happy man elinor did not offer detain him they parted with very earnest assurance on her side her unceasing good wishes for his happiness every change situation that might befall him on his with rather attempt return same good will than power expressing it when i see him again said elinor herself as door shut him out i shall see him husband lucy with this pleasing anticipation she sat down reconsider past recall words endeavour comprehend all feelings edward course reflect on her own with discontent when mrs jennings came home though she returned from seeing people whom she had never seen before whom therefore she must have great deal say her mind was so much more occupied by important secret her possession than by anything else that she reverted it again as soon as elinor appeared well my dear she cried i sent you up young man did not i do right i suppose you had no great difficulty you did not find him very unwilling accept your proposal no ma am that was not very likely well how soon will he be ready for it seems all depend upon that really said elinor i know so little these kind forms that i can hardly even conjecture as time or preparation necessary but i suppose two or three months will complete his ordination two or three months cried mrs jennings lord my dear how calmly you talk it can colonel wait two or three months lord bless me i am sure it would put me quite out patience though one would be very glad do kindness by poor mr ferrars i do think it is not worth while wait two or three months for him sure somebody else might be found that would do as well somebody that is orders already my dear ma am said elinor what can you be thinking why colonel brandon s only object is be use mr ferrars lord bless you my dear sure you do not mean persuade me that colonel only marries you for sake giving ten guineas mr ferrars deception could not continue after this explanation immediately took place by which both gained considerable amusement for moment without any material loss happiness either for mrs jennings only exchanged one form delight for another still without forfeiting her expectation first aye aye parsonage is but small one said she after first ebullition surprise satisfaction was over very likely may be out repair but hear man apologising as i thought for house that my knowledge has five sitting rooms on ground floor i think housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds you too that had been used live barton cottage it seems quite ridiculous but my dear we must touch up colonel do some thing parsonage make it comfortable for them before lucy goes it but colonel brandon does not seem have any idea living s being enough allow them marry colonel is ninny my dear because he has two thousand year himself he thinks that nobody else can marry on less take my word for it that if i am alive i shall be paying visit at delaford parsonage before michaelmas i am sure i shan t go if lucy t there elinor was quite her opinion as probability their not waiting for any thing more chapter xli edward having carried his thanks colonel brandon proceeded with his happiness lucy such was excess it by time he reached bartlett s buildings that she was able assure mrs jennings who called on her again next day with her congratulations that she had never seen him such spirits before her life her own happiness her own spirits were at least very certain she joined mrs jennings most heartily her expectation their being all comfortably together delaford parsonage before michaelmas so far was she at same time from any backwardness give elinor that credit which edward would give her that she spoke her friendship for them both with most grateful warmth was ready own all their obligation her openly declared that no exertion for their good on miss dashwood s part either present or future would ever surprise her for she believed her capable doing any thing world for those she really valued as for colonel brandon she was not only ready worship him as saint but was moreover truly anxious that he should be treated as one all worldly concerns anxious that his tithes should be raised utmost secretly resolved avail herself at delaford as far as she possibly could his servants his carriage his cows his poultry it was now above week since john dashwood had called berkeley street as since that time no notice had been taken by them his wife s indisposition beyond one verbal enquiry elinor began feel it necessary pay her visit this was obligation however which not only opposed her own inclination but which had not assistance any encouragement from her companions marianne not contented with absolutely refusing go herself was very urgent prevent her sister s going at all mrs jennings though her carriage was always at elinor s service so very much disliked mrs john dashwood that not even her curiosity see how she looked after late discovery nor her strong desire affront her by taking edward s part could overcome her unwillingness be her company again consequence was that elinor set out by herself pay visit for which no one could really have less inclination run risk t te t te with woman whom neither others had so much reason dislike mrs dashwood was denied but before carriage could turn from house her husband accidentally came out he expressed great pleasure meeting elinor told her that he had been just going call berkeley street assuring her that fanny would be very glad see her invited her come they walked up stairs drawing room nobody was there fanny is her own room i suppose said he i will go her presently for i am sure she will not have least objection world seeing you very far from it indeed now especially there cannot be but however you marianne were always great favourites why would not marianne come elinor made what excuse she could for her i am not sorry see you alone he replied for i have good deal say you this living colonel brandon s can it be true has he really given it edward i heard it yesterday by chance was coming you on purpose enquire farther about it it is perfectly true colonel brandon has given living delaford edward really well this is very astonishing no relationship no connection between them now that livings fetch such price what was value this about two hundred year very well for next presentation living that value supposing late incumbent have been old sickly likely vacate it soon he might have got i dare say fourteen hundred pounds how came he not have settled that matter before this person s death now indeed it would be too late sell it but man colonel brandon s sense i wonder he should be so improvident point such common such natural concern well i am convinced that there is vast deal inconsistency almost every human character i suppose however on recollection that case may probably be this edward is only hold living till person whom colonel has really sold presentation is old enough take it aye aye that is fact depend upon it elinor contradicted it however very positively by relating that she had herself been employed conveying offer from colonel brandon edward therefore must understand terms on which it was given obliged him submit her authority it is truly astonishing he cried after hearing what she said what could be colonel s motive very simple one be use mr ferrars well well whatever colonel brandon may be edward is very lucky man you will not mention matter fanny however for though i have broke it her she bears it vastly well she will not like hear it much talked elinor had some difficulty here refrain from observing that she thought fanny might have borne with composure acquisition wealth her brother by which neither she nor her child could be possibly impoverished mrs ferrars added he lowering his voice tone becoming so important subject knows nothing about it at present i believe it will be best keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may be when marriage takes place i fear she must hear it all but why should such precaution be used though it is not be supposed that mrs ferrars can have smallest satisfaction knowing that her son has money enough live upon for that must be quite out question yet why upon her late behaviour is she supposed feel at all she has done with her son she cast him off for ever has made all those over whom she had any influence cast him off likewise surely after doing so she cannot be imagined liable any impression sorrow or joy on his account she cannot be interested any thing that befalls him she would not be so weak as throw away comfort child yet retain anxiety parent ah elinor said john your reasoning is very good but it is founded on ignorance human nature when edward s unhappy match takes place depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had never discarded him therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that dreadful event must be concealed from her as much as possible mrs ferrars can never forget that edward is her son you surprise me i should think it must nearly have escaped her memory by this time you wrong her exceedingly mrs ferrars is one most affectionate mothers world elinor was silent we think now said mr dashwood after short pause robert s marrying miss morton elinor smiling at grave decisive importance her brother s tone calmly replied lady i suppose has no choice affair choice how do you mean i only mean that i suppose from your manner speaking it must be same miss morton whether she marry edward or robert certainly there can be no difference for robert will now all intents purposes be considered as eldest son as any thing else they are both very agreeable young men i do not know that one is superior other elinor said no more john was also for short time silent his reflections ended thus one thing my dear sister kindly taking her hand speaking awful whisper i may assure you i will do it because i know it must gratify you i have good reason think indeed i have it from best authority or i should not repeat it for otherwise it would be very wrong say any thing about it but i have it from very best authority not that i ever precisely heard mrs ferrars say it herself but her daughter did i have it from her that short whatever objections there might be against certain certain connection you understand me it would have been far preferable her it would not have given her half vexation that this does i was exceedingly pleased hear that mrs ferrars considered it that light very gratifying circumstance you know us all it would have been beyond comparison she said least evil two she would be glad compound now for nothing worse but however all that is quite out question not be thought or mentioned as any attachment you know it never could be all that is gone by but i thought i would just tell you this because i knew how much it must please you not that you have any reason regret my dear elinor there is no doubt your doing exceedingly well quite as well or better perhaps all things considered has colonel brandon been with you lately elinor had heard enough if not gratify her vanity raise her self importance agitate her nerves fill her mind she was therefore glad be spared from necessity saying much reply herself from danger hearing any thing more from her brother by entrance mr robert ferrars after few moments chat john dashwood recollecting that fanny was yet uninformed her sister s being there quitted room quest her elinor was left improve her acquaintance with robert who by gay unconcern happy self complacency his manner while enjoying so unfair division his mother s love liberality prejudice his banished brother earned only by his own dissipated course life that brother s integrity was confirming her most unfavourable opinion his head heart they had scarcely been two minutes by themselves before he began speak edward for he too had heard living was very inquisitive on subject elinor repeated particulars it as she had given them john their effect on robert though very different was not less striking than it had been on him he laughed most immoderately idea edward s being clergyman living small parsonage house diverted him beyond measure when that was added fanciful imagery edward reading prayers white surplice publishing banns marriage between john smith mary brown he could conceive nothing more ridiculous elinor while she waited silence immovable gravity conclusion such folly could not restrain her eyes from being fixed on him with look that spoke all contempt it excited it was look however very well bestowed for it relieved her own feelings gave no intelligence him he was recalled from wit wisdom not by any reproof hers but by his own sensibility we may treat it as joke said he at last recovering from affected laugh which had considerably lengthened out genuine gaiety moment but upon my soul it is most serious business poor edward he is ruined for ever i am extremely sorry for it for i know him be very good hearted creature as well meaning fellow perhaps as any world you must not judge him miss dashwood from your slight acquaintance poor edward his manners are certainly not happiest nature but we are not all born you know with same powers same address poor fellow see him circle strangers be sure it was pitiable enough but upon my soul i believe he has as good heart as any kingdom i declare protest you i never was so shocked my life as when it all burst forth i could not believe it my mother was first person who told me it i feeling myself called on act with resolution immediately said her my dear madam i do not know what you may intend do on occasion but as for myself i must say that if edward does marry this young woman i never will see him again that was what i said immediately i was most uncommonly shocked indeed poor edward he has done for himself completely shut himself out for ever from all decent society but as i directly said my mother i am not least surprised at it from his style education it was always be expected my poor mother was half frantic have you ever seen lady yes once while she was staying this house i happened drop for ten minutes i saw quite enough her merest awkward country girl without style or elegance almost without beauty i remember her perfectly just kind girl i should suppose likely captivate poor edward i offered immediately as soon as my mother related affair me talk him myself dissuade him from match but it was too late then i found do any thing for unluckily i was not way at first knew nothing it till after breach had taken place when it was not for me you know interfere but had i been informed it few hours earlier i think it is most probable that something might have been hit on i certainly should have represented it edward very strong light my dear fellow i should have said consider what you are doing you are making most disgraceful connection such one as your family are unanimous disapproving i cannot help thinking short that means might have been found but now it is all too late he must be starved you know that is certain absolutely starved he had just settled this point with great composure when entrance mrs john dashwood put end subject but though she never spoke it out her own family elinor could see its influence on her mind something like confusion countenance with which she entered attempt at cordiality her behaviour herself she even proceeded so far as be concerned find that elinor her sister were so soon leave town as she had hoped see more them exertion which her husband who attended her into room hung enamoured over her accents seemed distinguish every thing that was most affectionate graceful chapter xlii one other short call harley street which elinor received her brother s congratulations on their travelling so far towards barton without any expense on colonel brandon s being follow them cleveland day or two completed intercourse brother sisters town faint invitation from fanny come norland whenever it should happen be their way which all things was most unlikely occur with more warm though less public assurance from john elinor promptitude with which he should come see her at delaford was all that foretold any meeting country it amused her observe that all her friends seemed determined send her delaford place which all others she would now least chuse visit or wish reside for not only was it considered as her future home by her brother mrs jennings but even lucy when they parted gave her pressing invitation visit her there very early april tolerably early day two parties from hanover square berkeley street set out from their respective homes meet by appointment on road for convenience charlotte her child they were be more than two days on their journey mr palmer travelling more expeditiously with colonel brandon was join them at cleveland soon after their arrival marianne few as had been her hours comfort london eager as she had long been quit it could not when it came point bid adieu house which she had for last time enjoyed those hopes that confidence willoughby which were now extinguished for ever without great pain nor could she leave place which willoughby remained busy new engagements new schemes which she could have no share without shedding many tears elinor s satisfaction at moment removal was more positive she had no such object for her lingering thoughts fix on she left no creature behind from whom it would give her moment s regret be divided for ever she was pleased be free herself from persecution lucy s friendship she was grateful for bringing her sister away unseen by willoughby since his marriage she looked forward with hope what few months tranquility at barton might do towards restoring marianne s peace mind confirming her own their journey was safely performed second day brought them into cherished or prohibited county somerset for as such was it dwelt on by turns marianne s imagination forenoon third they drove up cleveland cleveland was spacious modern built house situated on sloping lawn it had no park but pleasure grounds were tolerably extensive like every other place same degree importance it had its open shrubbery closer wood walk road smooth gravel winding round plantation led front lawn was dotted over with timber house itself was under guardianship fir mountain ash acacia thick screen them altogether interspersed with tall lombardy poplars shut out offices marianne entered house with heart swelling with emotion from consciousness being only eighty miles from barton not thirty from combe magna before she had been five minutes within its walls while others were busily helping charlotte show her child housekeeper she quitted it again stealing away through winding shrubberies now just beginning be beauty gain distant eminence where from its grecian temple her eye wandering over wide tract country south east could fondly rest on farthest ridge hills horizon fancy that from their summits combe magna might be seen such moments precious invaluable misery she rejoiced tears agony be at cleveland as she returned by different circuit house feeling all happy privilege country liberty wandering from place place free luxurious solitude she resolved spend almost every hour every day while she remained with palmers indulgence such solitary rambles she returned just time join others as they quitted house on excursion through its more immediate premises rest morning was easily whiled away lounging round kitchen garden examining bloom upon its walls listening gardener s lamentations upon blights dawdling through green house where loss her favourite plants unwarily exposed nipped by lingering frost raised laughter charlotte visiting her poultry yard where disappointed hopes her dairy maid by hens forsaking their nests or being stolen by fox or rapid decrease promising young brood she found fresh sources merriment morning was fine dry marianne her plan employment abroad had not calculated for any change weather during their stay at cleveland with great surprise therefore did she find herself prevented by settled rain from going out again after dinner she had depended on twilight walk grecian temple perhaps all over grounds evening merely cold or damp would not have deterred her from it but heavy settled rain even she could not fancy dry or pleasant weather for walking their party was small hours passed quietly away mrs palmer had her child mrs jennings her carpet work they talked friends they had left behind arranged lady middleton s engagements wondered whether mr palmer colonel brandon would get farther than reading that night elinor however little concerned it joined their discourse marianne who had knack finding her way every house library however it might be avoided by family general soon procured herself book nothing was wanting on mrs palmer s side that constant friendly good humour could do make them feel themselves welcome openness heartiness her manner more than atoned for that want recollection elegance which made her often deficient forms politeness her kindness recommended by so pretty face was engaging her folly though evident was not disgusting because it was not conceited elinor could have forgiven every thing but her laugh two gentlemen arrived next day very late dinner affording pleasant enlargement party very welcome variety their conversation which long morning same continued rain had reduced very low elinor had seen so little mr palmer that little had seen so much variety his address her sister herself that she knew not what expect find him his own family she found him however perfectly gentleman his behaviour all his visitors only occasionally rude his wife her mother she found him very capable being pleasant companion only prevented from being so always by too great aptitude fancy himself as much superior people general as he must feel himself be mrs jennings charlotte for rest his character habits they were marked as far as elinor could perceive with no traits at all unusual his sex time life he was nice his eating uncertain his hours fond his child though affecting slight it idled away mornings at billiards which ought have been devoted business she liked him however upon whole much better than she had expected her heart was not sorry that she could like him no more not sorry be driven by observation his epicurism his selfishness his conceit rest with complacency on remembrance edward s generous temper simple taste diffident feelings edward or at least some his concerns she now received intelligence from colonel brandon who had been into dorsetshire lately who treating her at once as disinterested friend mr ferrars kind confidante himself talked her great deal parsonage at delaford described its deficiencies told her what he meant do himself towards removing them his behaviour her this as well as every other particular his open pleasure meeting her after absence only ten days his readiness converse with her his deference for her opinion might very well justify mrs jennings s persuasion his attachment would have been enough perhaps had not elinor still as from first believed marianne his real favourite make her suspect it herself but as it was such notion had scarcely ever entered her head except by mrs jennings s suggestion she could not help believing herself nicest observer two she watched his eyes while mrs jennings thought only his behaviour while his looks anxious solicitude on marianne s feeling her head throat beginning heavy cold because unexpressed by words entirely escaped latter lady s observation she could discover them quick feelings needless alarm lover two delightful twilight walks on third fourth evenings her being there not merely on dry gravel shrubbery but all over grounds especially most distant parts them where there was something more wildness than rest where trees were oldest grass was longest wettest had assisted by still greater imprudence sitting her wet shoes stockings given marianne cold so violent as though for day or two trifled with or denied would force itself by increasing ailments on concern every body notice herself prescriptions poured from all quarters as usual were all declined though heavy feverish with pain her limbs cough sore throat good night s rest was cure her entirely it was with difficulty that elinor prevailed on her when she went bed try one or two simplest remedies chapter xliii marianne got up next morning at her usual time every inquiry replied that she was better tried prove herself so by engaging her accustomary employments but day spent sitting shivering over fire with book her hand which she was unable read or lying weary languid on sofa did not speak much favour her amendment when at last she went early bed more more indisposed colonel brandon was only astonished at her sister s composure who though attending nursing her whole day against marianne s inclination forcing proper medicines on her at night trusted like marianne certainty efficacy sleep felt no real alarm very restless feverish night however disappointed expectation both when marianne after persisting rising confessed herself unable sit up returned voluntarily her bed elinor was very ready adopt mrs jennings s advice sending for palmers apothecary he came examined his patient though encouraging miss dashwood expect that very few days would restore her sister health yet by pronouncing her disorder have putrid tendency allowing word infection pass his lips gave instant alarm mrs palmer on her baby s account mrs jennings who had been inclined from first think marianne s complaint more serious than elinor now looked very grave on mr harris s report confirming charlotte s fears caution urged necessity her immediate removal with her infant mr palmer though treating their apprehensions as idle found anxiety importunity his wife too great be withstood her departure therefore was fixed on within hour after mr harris s arrival she set off with her little boy his nurse for house near relation mr palmer s who lived few miles on other side bath whither her husband promised at her earnest entreaty join her day or two whither she was almost equally urgent with her mother accompany her mrs jennings however with kindness heart which made elinor really love her declared her resolution not stirring from

cheerful mrs jennings had determined very early seizure that marianne would never get over it colonel brandon who was chiefly use listening mrs jennings s forebodings was not state mind resist their influence he tried reason himself out fears which different judgment apothecary seemed render absurd but many hours each day which he was left entirely alone were but too favourable for admission every melancholy idea he could not expel from his mind persuasion that he should see marianne no more on morning third day however gloomy anticipations both were almost done away for when mr harris arrived he declared his patient materially better her pulse was much stronger every symptom more favourable than on preceding visit elinor confirmed every pleasant hope was all cheerfulness rejoicing that her letters her mother she had pursued her own judgment rather than her friend s making very light indisposition which delayed them at cleveland almost fixing on time when marianne would be able travel but day did not close so auspiciously as it began towards evening marianne became ill again growing more heavy restless uncomfortable than before her sister however still sanguine was willing

beneficial effects her sleep though not so quiet as elinor wished see it lasted considerable time anxious observe result it herself she resolved sit with her during whole it mrs jennings knowing nothing any change patient went unusually early bed her maid who was one principal nurses was recreating herself housekeeper s room elinor remained alone with marianne repose latter became more more

painful slumber when marianne suddenly awakened by some accidental noise house started hastily up with feverish wildness cried out is mama coming not yet cried other concealing her terror assisting marianne lie down again but she will be here i hope before it is long it is great way you know from hence barton but she must not go round by london cried marianne same hurried manner i shall never

thought which immediately followed resolution its performance as soon she had rung up maid take her place by her sister she hastened down drawing room where she knew he was generally be found at much later hour than present it was no time for hesitation her fears her difficulties were immediately before him her fears he had no courage no confidence attempt removal he listened them silent despondence but her difficulties were instantly obviated for with readiness that seemed speak occasion service pre arranged his mind he offered himself as messenger who should fetch mrs dashwood elinor made no resistance that was not easily overcome she thanked him with brief though fervent gratitude while he went hurry off his servant with message mr harris order for post horses directly she wrote few lines her mother comfort such friend at that moment as colonel brandon or such companion for her mother how gratefully was it felt companion whose judgment would guide whose attendance must relieve whose friendship might soothe her as far as shock such summons could be lessened her his presence his manners his assistance would lessen it he meanwhile whatever he might feel acted with all firmness collected mind made every necessary arrangement with utmost despatch calculated with exactness time which she might look for his return not moment was lost delay any kind horses arrived even before they were expected colonel brandon only pressing her hand with look solemnity few words spoken too low reach her ear hurried into carriage it was then about twelve o clock she returned her sister s apartment wait for arrival apothecary watch by her rest night it was night almost equal suffering both hour after hour passed away sleepless pain delirium on marianne s side most cruel anxiety on elinor s before mr harris appeared her apprehensions once raised paid by their excess for all her former security servant who sat up with her for she would not allow mrs jennings be called only tortured her more by hints what her mistress had always thought marianne s ideas were still at intervals fixed incoherently on her mother whenever she mentioned her name it gave pang heart poor elinor who reproaching herself for having trifled with so many days illness wretched for some immediate relief fancied that all relief might soon be vain that every thing had been delayed too long pictured herself her suffering mother arriving too late see this darling child or see her rational she was on point sending again for mr harris or if he could not come for some other advice when former but not till after five o clock arrived his opinion however made some little amends for his delay for though acknowledging very unexpected unpleasant alteration his patient he would not allow danger be material talked relief which fresh mode treatment must procure with confidence which lesser degree was communicated elinor he promised call again course three or four hours left both patient her anxious attendant more composed than he had found them with strong concern with many reproaches for not being called their aid did mrs jennings hear morning what had passed her former apprehensions now with greater reason restored left her no doubt event though trying speak comfort elinor her conviction her sister s danger would not allow her offer comfort hope her heart was really grieved rapid decay early death girl so young so lovely as marianne must have struck less interested person with concern on mrs jennings s compassion she had other claims she had been for three months her companion was still under her care she was known have been greatly injured long unhappy distress her sister too particularly favourite was before her as for their mother when mrs jennings considered that marianne might probably be her what charlotte was herself her sympathy her sufferings was very sincere mr harris was punctual his second visit but he came be disappointed his hopes what last would produce his medicines had failed fever was unabated marianne only more quiet not more herself remained heavy stupor elinor catching all more than all his fears moment proposed call further advice but he judged it unnecessary he had still something more try some more fresh application whose success he was as confident as last his visit concluded with encouraging assurances which reached ear but could not enter heart miss dashwood she was calm except when she thought her mother but she was almost hopeless this state she continued till noon scarcely stirring from her sister s bed her thoughts wandering from one image grief one suffering friend another her spirits oppressed utmost by conversation mrs jennings who scrupled not attribute severity danger this attack many weeks previous indisposition which marianne s disappointment had brought on elinor felt all reasonableness idea it gave fresh misery her reflections about noon however she began but with caution dread disappointment which for some time kept her silent even her friend fancy hope she could perceive slight amendment her sister s pulse she waited watched examined it again again at last with agitation more difficult bury under exterior calmness than all her foregoing distress ventured communicate her hopes mrs jennings though forced on examination acknowledge temporary revival tried keep her young friend from indulging thought its continuance elinor conning over every injunction distrust told herself likewise not hope but it was too late hope had already entered feeling all its anxious flutter she bent over her sister watch she hardly knew for what half hour passed away favourable symptom yet blessed her others even arose confirm it her breath her skin her lips all flattered elinor with signs amendment marianne fixed her eyes on her with rational though languid gaze anxiety hope now oppressed her equal degrees left her no moment tranquillity till arrival mr harris at four o clock when his assurances his felicitations on recovery her sister even surpassing his expectation gave her confidence comfort tears joy marianne was every respect materially better he declared her entirely out danger mrs jennings perhaps satisfied with partial justification her forebodings which had been found their late alarm allowed herself trust his judgment admitted with unfeigned joy soon with unequivocal cheerfulness probability entire recovery elinor could not be cheerful her joy was different kind led any thing rather than gaiety marianne restored life health friends her doting mother was idea fill her heart with sensations exquisite comfort expand it fervent gratitude but it led no outward demonstrations joy no words no smiles all within elinor s breast was satisfaction silent strong she continued by side her sister with little intermission whole afternoon calming every fear satisfying every inquiry her enfeebled spirits supplying every succour watching almost every look every breath possibility relapse would course some moments occur remind her what anxiety was but when she saw on her frequent minute examination that every symptom recovery continued saw marianne at six o clock sink into quiet steady all appearance comfortable sleep she silenced every doubt time was now drawing on when colonel brandon might be expected back at ten o clock she trusted or at least not much later her mother would be relieved from dreadful suspense which she must now be travelling towards them colonel too perhaps scarcely less object pity oh how slow was progress time which yet kept them ignorance at seven o clock leaving marianne still sweetly asleep she joined mrs jennings drawing room tea breakfast she had been kept by her fears dinner by their sudden reverse from eating much present refreshment therefore with such feelings content as she brought it was particularly welcome mrs jennings would have persuaded her at its conclusion take some rest before her mother s arrival allow her take her place by marianne but elinor had no sense fatigue no capability sleep at that moment about her she was not be kept away from her sister unnecessary instant mrs jennings therefore attending her up stairs into sick chamber satisfy herself that all continued right left her there again her charge her thoughts retired her own room write letters sleep night was cold stormy wind roared round house rain beat against windows but elinor all happiness within regarded it not marianne slept through every blast travellers they had rich reward store for every present inconvenience clock struck eight had it been ten elinor would have been convinced that at that moment she heard carriage driving up house so strong was persuasion that she did spite almost impossibility their being already come that she moved into adjoining dressing closet opened window shutter be satisfied truth she instantly saw that her ears had not deceived her flaring lamps carriage were immediately view by their uncertain light she thought she could discern it be drawn by four horses this while it told excess her poor mother s alarm gave some explanation such unexpected rapidity never her life had elinor found it so difficult be calm as at that moment knowledge what her mother must be feeling as carriage stopt at door her doubt her dread perhaps her despair what she had tell with such knowledge it was impossible be calm all that remained be done was be speedy therefore staying only till she could leave mrs jennings s maid with her sister she hurried down stairs bustle vestibule as she passed along inner lobby assured her that they were already house she rushed drawing room she entered it saw only willoughby chapter xliv elinor starting back with look horror at sight him obeyed first impulse her heart turning instantly quit room her hand was already on lock when its action was suspended by his hastily advancing saying voice rather command than supplication miss dashwood for half hour for ten minutes i entreat you stay no sir she replied with firmness i shall not stay your business cannot be with me servants i suppose forgot tell you that mr palmer was not house had they told me he cried with vehemence that mr palmer all his relations were at devil it would not have turned me from door my business is with you only you with me utmost amazement well sir be quick if you can less violent sit down i will be both she hesitated she knew not what do possibility colonel brandon s arriving finding her there came across her but she had promised hear him her curiosity no less than her honor was engaged after moment s recollection therefore concluding that prudence required dispatch that her acquiescence would best promote it she walked silently towards table sat down he took opposite chair for half minute not word was said by either pray be quick sir said elinor impatiently i have no time spare he was sitting attitude deep meditation seemed not hear her your sister said he with abruptness moment afterwards is out danger i heard it from servant god be praised but is it true is it really true elinor would not speak he repeated inquiry with yet greater eagerness for god s sake tell me is she out danger or is she not we hope she is he rose up walked across room had i known as much half hour ago but since i am here speaking with forced vivacity as he returned his seat what does it signify for once miss dashwood it will be last time perhaps let us be cheerful together i am fine mood for gaiety tell me honestly deeper glow overspreading his cheeks do you think me most knave or fool elinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever she began think that he must be liquor strangeness such visit such manners seemed no otherwise intelligible with this impression she immediately rose saying mr willoughby i advise you at present return combe i am not at leisure remain with you longer whatever your business may be with me it will be better recollected explained morrow i understand you he replied with expressive smile voice perfectly calm yes i am very drunk pint porter with my cold beef at marlborough was enough over set me at marlborough cried elinor more more at loss understand what he would be at yes i left london this morning at eight o clock only ten minutes i have spent out my chaise since that time procured me nuncheon at marlborough steadiness his manner intelligence his eye as he spoke convincing elinor that whatever other unpardonable folly might bring him cleveland he was not brought there by intoxication she said after moment s recollection mr willoughby you ought feel i certainly do that after what has passed your coming here this manner forcing yourself upon my notice requires very particular excuse what is it that you mean by it i mean said he with serious energy if i can make you hate me one degree less than you do now i mean offer some kind explanation some kind apology for past open my whole heart you by convincing you that though i have been always blockhead i have not been always rascal obtain something like forgiveness from ma from your sister is this real reason your coming upon my soul it is was his answer with warmth which brought all former willoughby her remembrance spite herself made her think him sincere if that is all you may be satisfied already for marianne does she has long forgiven you has she he cried same eager tone then she has forgiven me before she ought have done it but she shall forgive me again on more reasonable grounds now will you listen me elinor bowed her assent i do not know said he after pause expectation on her side thoughtfulness on his own how you may have accounted for my behaviour your sister or what diabolical motive you may have imputed me perhaps you will hardly think better me it is worth trial however you shall hear every thing when i first became intimate your family i had no other intention no other view acquaintance than pass my time pleasantly while i was obliged remain devonshire more pleasantly than i had ever done before your sister s lovely person interesting manners could not but please me her behaviour me almost from first was kind it is astonishing when i reflect on what it was what she was that my heart should have been so insensible but at first i must confess my vanity only was elevated by it careless her happiness thinking only my own amusement giving way feelings which i had always been too much habit indulging i endeavoured by every means my power make myself pleasing her without any design returning her affection miss dashwood at this point turning her eyes on him with most angry contempt stopped him by saying it is hardly worth while mr willoughby for you relate or for me listen any longer such beginning as this cannot be followed by any thing do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on subject i insist on you hearing whole it he replied my fortune was never large i had always been expensive always habit associating with people better income than myself every year since my coming age or even before i believe had added my debts though death my old cousin mrs smith was set me free yet that event being uncertain possibly far distant it had been for some time my intention re establish my circumstances by marrying woman fortune attach myself your sister therefore was not thing be thought with meanness selfishness cruelty which no indignant no contemptuous look even yours miss dashwood can ever reprobate too much i was acting this manner trying engage her regard without thought returning it but one thing may be said for me even that horrid state selfish vanity i did not know extent injury i meditated because i did not then know what it was love but have i ever known it well may it be doubted for had i really loved could i have sacrificed my feelings vanity avarice or what is more could i have sacrificed hers but i have done it avoid comparative poverty which her affection her society would have deprived all its horrors i have by raising myself affluence lost every thing that could make it blessing you did then said elinor little softened believe yourself at one time attached her have resisted such attractions have withstood such tenderness is there man on earth who could have done it yes i found myself by insensible degrees sincerely fond her happiest hours my life were what i spent with her when i felt my intentions were strictly honourable my feelings blameless even then however when fully determined on paying my addresses her i allowed myself most improperly put off from day day moment doing it from unwillingness enter into engagement while my circumstances were so greatly embarrassed i will not reason here nor will i stop for you expatiate on absurdity worse than absurdity scrupling engage my faith where my honour was already bound event has proved that i was cunning fool providing with great circumspection for possible opportunity making myself contemptible wretched for ever at last however my resolution was taken i had determined as soon as i could engage her alone justify attentions i had so invariably paid her openly assure her affection which i had already taken such pains display but interim interim very few hours that were pass before i could have opportunity speaking with her private circumstance occurred unlucky circumstance ruin all my resolution with it all my comfort discovery took place here he hesitated looked down mrs smith had somehow or other been informed i imagine by some distant relation whose interest it was deprive me her favour affair connection but i need not explain myself farther he added looking at her with heightened colour enquiring eye your particular intimacy you have probably heard whole story long ago i have returned elinor colouring likewise hardening her heart anew against any compassion for him i have heard it all how you will explain away any part your guilt that dreadful business i confess is beyond my comprehension remember cried willoughby from whom you received account could it be impartial one i acknowledge that her situation her character ought have been respected by me i do not mean justify myself but at same time cannot leave you suppose that i have nothing urge that because she was injured she was irreproachable because i was libertine she must be saint if violence her passions weakness her understanding i do not mean however defend myself her affection for me deserved better treatment i often with great self reproach recall tenderness which for very short time had power creating any return i wish i heartily wish it had never been but i have injured more than herself i have injured one whose affection for me may i say it was scarcely less warm than hers whose mind oh how infinitely superior your indifference however towards that unfortunate girl i must say it unpleasant me as discussion such subject may well be your indifference is no apology for your cruel neglect her do not think yourself excused by any weakness any natural defect understanding on her side wanton cruelty so evident on yours you must have known that while you were enjoying yourself devonshire pursuing fresh schemes always gay always happy she was reduced extremest indigence but upon my soul i did not know it he warmly replied i did not recollect that i had omitted give her my direction common sense might have told her how find it out well sir what said mrs smith she taxed me with offence at once my confusion may be guessed purity her life formality her notions her ignorance world every thing was against me matter itself i could not deny vain was every endeavour soften it she was previously disposed i believe doubt morality my conduct general was moreover discontented with very little attention very little portion my time that i had bestowed on her my present visit short it ended total breach by one measure i might have saved myself height her morality good woman she offered forgive past if i would marry eliza that could not be i was formally dismissed from her favour her house night following this affair i was go next morning was spent by me deliberating on what my future conduct should be struggle was great but it ended too soon my affection for marianne my thorough conviction her attachment me it was all insufficient outweigh that dread poverty or get better those false ideas necessity riches which i was naturally inclined feel expensive society had increased i had reason believe myself secure my present wife if i chose address her i persuaded myself think that nothing else common prudence remained for me do heavy scene however awaited me before i could leave devonshire i was engaged dine with you on that very day some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this engagement but whether i should write this apology or deliver it person was point long debate see marianne i felt would be dreadful i even doubted whether i could see her again keep my resolution that point however i undervalued my own magnanimity as event declared for i went i saw her saw her miserable left her miserable left her hoping never see her again why did you call mr willoughby said elinor reproachfully note would have answered every purpose why was it necessary call it was necessary my own pride i could not bear leave country manner that might lead you or rest neighbourhood suspect any part what had really passed between mrs smith myself i resolved therefore on calling at cottage my way honiton sight your dear sister however was really dreadful heighten matter i found her alone you were all gone i do not know where i had left her only evening before so fully so firmly resolved within my self on doing right few hours were have engaged her me for ever i remember how happy how gay were my spirits as i walked from cottage allenham satisfied with myself delighted with every body but this our last interview friendship i approached her with sense guilt that almost took from me power dissembling her sorrow her disappointment her deep regret when i told her that i was obliged leave devonshire so immediately i never shall forget it united too with such reliance such confidence me oh god what hard hearted rascal i was they were both silent for few moments elinor first spoke did you tell her that you should soon return i do not know what i told her he replied impatiently less than was due past beyond doubt all likelihood much more than was justified by future i cannot think it it won t do then came your dear mother torture me farther with all her kindness confidence thank heaven it did torture me i was miserable miss dashwood you cannot have idea comfort it gives me look back on my own misery i owe such grudge myself for stupid rascally folly my own heart that all my past sufferings under it are only triumph exultation me now well i went left all that i loved went those whom at best i was only indifferent my journey town travelling with my own horses therefore so tediously no creature speak my own reflections so cheerful when i looked forward every thing so inviting when i looked back at barton picture so soothing oh it was blessed journey he stopped well sir said elinor who though pitying him grew impatient for his departure this is all all no have you forgot what passed town that infamous letter did she show it you yes i saw every note that passed when first hers reached me as it immediately did for i was town whole time what i felt is common phrase not be expressed more simple one perhaps too simple raise any emotion my feelings were very very painful every line every word was hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer were she here would forbid dagger my heart know that marianne was town was same language thunderbolt thunderbolts daggers what reproof would she have given me her taste her opinions i believe they are better known me than my own i am sure they are dearer elinor s heart which had undergone many changes course this extraordinary conversation was now softened again yet she felt it her duty check such ideas her companion as last this is not right mr willoughby remember that you are married relate only what your conscience you think necessary for me hear marianne s note by assuring me that i was still as dear her as former days that spite many many weeks we had been separated she was as constant her own feelings as full faith constancy mine as ever awakened all my remorse i say awakened because time london business dissipation had some measure quieted it i had been growing fine hardened villain fancying myself indifferent her chusing fancy that she too must have become indifferent me talking myself our past attachment as mere idle trifling business shrugging up my shoulders proof its being so silencing every reproach overcoming every scruple by secretly saying now then i shall be heartily glad hear she is well married but this note made me know myself better i felt that she was infinitely dearer me than any other woman world that i was using her infamously but every thing was then just settled between miss grey me retreat was impossible all that i had do was avoid you both i sent no answer marianne intending by that preserve myself from her farther notice for some time i was even determined not call berkeley street but at last judging it wiser affect air cool common acquaintance than anything else i watched you all safely out house one morning left my name watched us out house even so you would be surprised hear how often i watched you how often i was on point falling with you i have entered many shop avoid your sight as carriage drove by lodging as i did bond street there was hardly day which i did not catch glimpse one or other you nothing but most constant watchfulness on my side most invariably prevailing desire keep out your sight could have separated us so long i avoided middletons as much as possible as well as everybody else who was likely prove acquaintance common not aware their being town however i blundered on sir john i believe first day his coming day after i had called at mrs jennings s he asked me party dance at his house evening had he not told me as inducement that you your sister were be there i should have felt it too certain thing trust myself near him next morning brought another short note from marianne still affectionate open artless confiding everything that could make my conduct most hateful i could not answer it i tried but could not frame sentence but i thought her i believe every moment day if you can pity me miss dashwood pity my situation as it was then with my head heart full your sister i was forced play happy lover another woman those three or four weeks were worse than all well at last as i need not tell you you were forced on me what sweet figure i cut what evening agony it was marianne beautiful as angel on one side calling me willoughby such tone oh god holding out her hand me asking me for explanation with those bewitching eyes fixed such speaking solicitude on my face sophia jealous as devil on other hand looking all that was well it does not signify it is over now such evening i ran away from you all as soon as i could but not before i had seen marianne s sweet face as white as death that was last last look i ever had her last manner which she appeared me it was horrid sight yet when i thought her day as really dying it was kind comfort me imagine that i knew exactly how she would appear those who saw her last this world she was before me constantly before me as i travelled same look hue short pause mutual thoughtfulness succeeded willoughby first rousing himself broke it thus well let me make haste be gone your sister is certainly better certainly out danger we are assured it your poor mother too doting on marianne but letter mr willoughby your own letter have you any thing say about that yes yes that particular your sister wrote me again you know very next morning you saw what she said i was breakfasting at ellisons her letter with some others was brought me there from my lodgings it happened catch sophia s eye before it caught mine its size elegance paper hand writing altogether immediately gave her suspicion some vague report had reached her before my attachment some young lady devonshire what had passed within her observation preceding evening had marked who young lady was made her more jealous than ever affecting that air playfulness therefore which is delightful woman one loves she opened letter directly read its contents she was well paid for her impudence she read what made her wretched her wretchedness i could have borne but her passion her malice at all events it must be appeased short what do you think my wife s style letter writing delicate tender truly feminine was it not your wife letter was your own hand writing yes but i had only credit servilely copying such sentences as i was ashamed put my name original was all her own her own happy thoughts gentle diction but what could i do we were engaged every thing preparation day almost fixed but i am talking like fool preparation day honest words her money was necessary me situation like mine any thing was be done prevent rupture after all what did it signify my character opinion marianne her friends what language my answer was couched it must have been only one end my business was declare myself scoundrel whether i did it with bow or bluster was little importance i am ruined for ever their opinion said i myself i am shut out for ever from their society they already think me unprincipled fellow this letter will only make them think me blackguard one such were my reasonings as sort desperate carelessness i copied my wife s words parted with last relics marianne her three notes unluckily they were all my pocketbook or i should have denied their existence hoarded them for ever i was forced put them up could not even kiss them lock hair that too i had always carried about me same pocket book which was now searched by madam with most ingratiating virulence dear lock all every memento was torn from me you are very wrong mr willoughby very blamable said elinor while her voice spite herself betrayed her compassionate emotion you ought not speak this way either mrs willoughby or my sister you had made your own choice it was not forced on you your wife has claim your politeness your respect at least she must be attached you or she would not have married you treat her with unkindness speak her slightingly is no atonement marianne nor can i suppose it relief your own conscience do not talk me my wife said he with heavy sigh she does not deserve your compassion she knew i had no regard for her when we married well married we were came down combe magna be happy afterwards returned town be gay now do you pity me miss dashwood or have i said all this no purpose am i be it only one degree am i less guilty your opinion than i was before my intentions were not always wrong have i explained away any part my guilt yes you have certainly removed something little you have proved yourself on whole less faulty than i had believed you you have proved your heart less wicked much less wicked but i hardly know misery that you have inflicted i hardly know what could have made it worse will you repeat your sister when she is recovered what i have been telling you let me be little lightened too her opinion as well as yours you tell me that she has forgiven me already let me be able fancy that better knowledge my heart my present feelings will draw from her more spontaneous more natural more gentle less dignified forgiveness tell her my misery my penitence tell her that my heart was never inconstant her if you will that at this moment she is dearer me than ever i will tell her all that is necessary what may comparatively be called your justification but you have not explained me particular reason your coming now nor how you heard her illness last night drury lane lobby i ran against sir john middleton when he saw who i was for first time these two months he spoke me that he had cut me ever since my marriage i had seen without surprise or resentment now however his good natured honest stupid soul full indignation against me concern for your sister could not resist temptation telling me what he knew ought though probably he did not think it would vex me horridly as bluntly as he could speak it therefore he told me that marianne dashwood was dying putrid fever at cleveland letter that morning received from mrs jennings declared her danger most imminent palmers are all gone off fright c i was too much shocked be able pass myself off as insensible even undiscerning sir john his heart was softened seeing mine suffer so much his ill will was done away that when we parted he almost shook me by hand while he reminded me old promise about pointer puppy what i felt on hearing that your sister was dying dying too believing me greatest villain upon earth scorning hating me her latest moments for how could i tell what horrid projects might not have been imputed one person i was sure would represent me as capable anything what i felt was dreadful my resolution was soon made at eight o clock this morning i was my carriage now you know all elinor made no answer her thoughts were silently fixed on irreparable injury which too early independence its consequent habits idleness dissipation luxury had made mind character happiness man who every advantage person talents united disposition naturally open honest feeling affectionate temper world had made him extravagant vain extravagance vanity had made him cold hearted selfish vanity while seeking its own guilty triumph at expense another had involved him real attachment which extravagance or at least its offspring necessity had required be sacrificed each faulty propensity leading him evil had led him likewise punishment attachment from which against honour against feeling against every better interest he had outwardly torn himself now when no longer allowable governed every thought connection for sake which he had with little scruple left her sister misery was likely prove source unhappiness himself far more incurable nature from reverie this kind she was recalled at end some minutes by willoughby who rousing himself from reverie at least equally painful started up preparation for going said there is no use staying here i must be off are you going back town no combe magna i have business there from thence town day or two good bye he held out his hand she could not refuse give him hers he pressed it with affection you do think something better me than you did said he letting it fall leaning against mantel piece as if forgetting he was go elinor assured him that she did that she forgave pitied wished him well was even interested his happiness added some gentle counsel as behaviour most likely promote it his answer was not very encouraging as that said he i must rub through world as well as i can domestic happiness is out question if however i am allowed think that you yours feel interest my fate actions it may be means it may put me on my guard at least it may be something live for marianne be sure is lost me for ever were i even by any blessed chance at liberty again elinor stopped him with reproof well he replied once more good bye i shall now go away live dread one event what do you mean your sister s marriage you are very wrong she can never be more lost you than she is now but she will be gained by some one else if that some one should be very he whom all others i could least bear but i will not stay rob myself all your compassionate goodwill by showing that where i have most injured i can least forgive good bye god bless you with these words he almost ran out room chapter xlv elinor for some time after he left her for some time even after sound his carriage had died away remained too much oppressed by crowd ideas widely differing themselves but which sadness was general result think even her sister willoughby he whom only half hour ago she had abhorred as most worthless men willoughby spite all his faults excited degree commiseration for sufferings produced by them which made her think him as now separated for ever from her family with tenderness regret rather proportion as she soon acknowledged within herself his wishes than his merits she felt that his influence over her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought not reason have weight by that person uncommon attraction that open affectionate lively manner which it was no merit possess by that still ardent love for marianne which it was not even innocent indulge but she felt that it was so long long before she could feel his influence less when at last she returned unconscious marianne she found her just awaking refreshed by so long sweet sleep extent her hopes elinor s heart was full past present future willoughby s visit marianne s safety her mother s expected arrival threw her altogether into agitation spirits which kept off every indication fatigue made her only fearful betraying herself her sister short was time however which that fear could affect her for within half hour after willoughby s leaving house she was again called down stairs by sound another carriage eager save her mother from every unnecessary moment s horrible suspense she ran immediately into hall reached outward door just time receive support her as she entered it mrs dashwood whose terror as they drew near house had produced almost conviction marianne s being no more had no voice inquire after her no voice even for elinor but she waiting neither for salutation nor inquiry instantly gave joyful relief her mother catching it with all her usual warmth was moment as much overcome by her happiness as she had been before by her fears she was supported into drawing room between her daughter her friend there shedding tears joy though still unable speak embraced elinor again again turning from her at intervals press colonel brandon s hand with look which spoke at once her gratitude her conviction his sharing with herself bliss moment he shared it however silence even greater than her own as soon as mrs dashwood had recovered herself see marianne was her first desire two minutes she was with her beloved child rendered dearer her than ever by absence unhappiness danger elinor s delight as she saw what each felt meeting was only checked by apprehension its robbing marianne farther sleep but mrs dashwood could be calm could be even prudent when life child was at stake marianne satisfied knowing her mother was near her conscious being too weak for conversation submitted readily silence quiet prescribed by every nurse around her mrs dashwood would sit up with her all night elinor compliance with her mother s entreaty went bed but rest which one night entirely sleepless many hours most wearing anxiety seemed make requisite was kept off by irritation spirits willoughby poor willoughby as she now allowed herself call him was constantly her thoughts she would not but have heard his vindication for world now blamed now acquitted herself for having judged him so harshly before but her promise relating it her sister was invariably painful she dreaded performance it dreaded what its effect on marianne might be doubted whether after such explanation she could ever be happy with another for moment wished willoughby widower then remembering colonel brandon reproved herself felt that his sufferings his constancy far more than his rival s reward her sister was due wished any thing rather than mrs willoughby s death shock colonel brandon s errand at barton had been much softened mrs dashwood by her own previous alarm for so great was her uneasiness about marianne that she had already determined set out for cleveland on that very day without waiting for any further intelligence had so far settled her journey before his arrival that careys were then expected every moment fetch margaret away as her mother was unwilling take her where there might be infection marianne continued mend every day brilliant cheerfulness mrs dashwood s looks spirits proved her be as she repeatedly declared herself one happiest women world elinor could not hear declaration nor witness its proofs without sometimes wondering whether her mother ever recollected edward but mrs dashwood trusting temperate account her own disappointment which elinor had sent her was led away by exuberance her joy think only what would increase it marianne was restored her from danger which as she now began feel her own mistaken judgment encouraging unfortunate attachment willoughby had contributed place her her recovery she had yet another source joy unthought by elinor it was thus imparted her as soon as any opportunity private conference between them occurred at last we are alone my elinor you do not yet know all my happiness colonel brandon loves marianne he has told me so himself her daughter feeling by turns both pleased pained surprised not surprised was all silent attention you are never like me dear elinor or i should wonder at your composure now had i sat down wish for any possible good my family i should have fixed on colonel brandon s marrying one you as object most desirable i believe marianne will be most happy with him two elinor was half inclined ask her reason for thinking so because satisfied that none founded on impartial consideration their age characters or feelings could be given but her mother must always be carried away by her imagination on any interesting subject therefore instead inquiry she passed it off with smile he opened his whole heart me yesterday as we travelled it came out quite unawares quite undesignedly i you may well believe could talk nothing but my child he could not conceal his distress i saw that it equalled my own he perhaps thinking that mere friendship as world now goes would not justify so warm sympathy or rather not thinking at all i suppose giving way irresistible feelings made me acquainted with his earnest tender constant affection for marianne he has loved her my elinor ever since first moment seeing her here however elinor perceived not language not professions colonel brandon but natural embellishments her mother s active fancy which fashioned every thing delightful her as it chose his regard for her infinitely surpassing anything that willoughby ever felt or feigned as much more warm as more sincere or constant which ever we are call it has subsisted through all knowledge dear marianne s unhappy prepossession for that worthless young man without selfishness without encouraging hope could he have seen her happy with another such noble mind such openness such sincerity no one can be deceived him colonel brandon s character said elinor as excellent man is well established i know it is replied her mother seriously or after such warning i should be last encourage such affection or even be pleased by it but his coming for me as he did with such active such ready friendship is enough prove him one worthiest men his character however answered elinor does not rest on one act kindness which his affection for marianne were humanity out case would have prompted him mrs jennings middletons he has been long intimately known they equally love respect him even my own knowledge him though lately acquired is very considerable so highly do i value esteem him that if marianne can be happy with him i shall be as ready as yourself think our connection greatest blessing us world what answer did you give him did you allow him hope oh my love i could not then talk hope him or myself marianne might at that moment be dying but he did not ask for hope or encouragement his was involuntary confidence irrepressible effusion soothing friend not application parent yet after time i did say for at first i was quite overcome that if she lived as i trusted she might my greatest happiness would lie promoting their marriage since our arrival since our delightful security i have repeated it him more fully have given him every encouragement my power time very little time i tell him will do everything marianne s heart is not be wasted for ever on such man as willoughby his own merits must soon secure it judge from colonel s spirits however you have not yet made him equally sanguine no he thinks marianne s affection too deeply rooted for any change it under great length time even supposing her heart again free is too diffident himself believe that with such difference age disposition he could ever attach her there however he is quite mistaken his age is only so much beyond hers as be advantage as make his character principles fixed his disposition i am well convinced is exactly very one make your sister happy his person his manners too are all his favour my partiality does not blind me he certainly is not so handsome as willoughby but at same time there is something much more pleasing his countenance there was always something if you remember willoughby s eyes at times which i did not like elinor could not remember it but her mother without waiting for her assent continued his manners colonel s manners are not only more pleasing me than willoughby s ever were but they are kind i well know be more solidly attaching marianne their gentleness their genuine attention other people their manly unstudied simplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition than liveliness often artificial often ill timed other i am very sure myself that had willoughby turned out as really amiable as he has proved himself contrary marianne would yet never have been so happy with him as she will be with colonel brandon she paused her daughter could not quite agree with her but her dissent was not heard therefore gave no offence at delaford she will be within easy distance me added mrs dashwood even if i remain at barton all probability for i hear it is large village indeed there certainly must be some small house or cottage close by that would suit us quite as well as our present situation poor elinor here was new scheme for getting her delaford but her spirit was stubborn his fortune too for at my time life you know everybody cares about that though i neither know nor desire know what it really is i am sure it must be good one here they were interrupted by entrance third person elinor withdrew think it all over private wish success her friend yet wishing it feel pang for willoughby chapter xlvi marianne s illness though weakening its kind had not been long enough make her recovery slow with youth natural strength her mother s presence aid it proceeded so smoothly as enable her remove within four days after arrival latter into mrs palmer s dressing room when there at her own particular request for she was impatient pour forth her thanks him for fetching her mother colonel brandon was invited visit her his emotion on entering room seeing her altered looks receiving pale hand which she immediately held out him was such as elinor s conjecture must arise from something more than his affection for marianne or consciousness its being known others she soon discovered his melancholy eye varying complexion as he looked at her sister probable recurrence many past scenes misery his mind brought back by that resemblance between marianne eliza already acknowledged now strengthened by hollow eye sickly skin posture reclining weakness warm acknowledgment peculiar obligation mrs dashwood not less watchful what passed than her daughter but with mind very differently influenced therefore watching very different effect saw nothing colonel s behaviour but what arose from most simple self evident sensations while actions words marianne she persuaded herself think that something more than gratitude already dawned at end another day or two marianne growing visibly stronger every twelve hours mrs dashwood urged equally by her own her daughter s wishes began talk removing barton on her measures depended those her two friends mrs jennings could not quit cleveland during dashwoods stay colonel brandon was soon brought by their united request consider his own abode there as equally determinate if not equally indispensable at his mrs jennings s united request return mrs dashwood was prevailed on accept use his carriage on her journey back for better accommodation her sick child colonel at joint invitation mrs dashwood mrs jennings whose active good nature made her friendly hospitable for other people as well as herself engaged with pleasure redeem it by visit at cottage course few weeks day separation departure arrived marianne after taking so particular lengthened leave mrs jennings one so earnestly grateful so full respect kind wishes as seemed due her own heart from secret acknowledgment past inattention bidding colonel brandon farewell with cordiality friend was carefully assisted by him into carriage which he seemed anxious that she should engross at least half mrs dashwood elinor then followed others were left by themselves talk travellers feel their own dullness till mrs jennings was summoned her chaise take comfort gossip her maid for loss her two young companions colonel brandon immediately afterwards took his solitary way delaford dashwoods were two days on road marianne bore her journey on both without essential fatigue every thing that most zealous affection most solicitous care could do render her comfortable was office each watchful companion each found their reward her bodily ease her calmness spirits elinor observation latter was particularly grateful she who had seen her week after week so constantly suffering oppressed by anguish heart which she had neither courage speak nor fortitude conceal now saw with joy which no other could equally share apparent composure mind which being result as she trusted serious reflection must eventually lead her contentment cheerfulness as they approached barton indeed entered on scenes which every field every tree brought some peculiar some painful recollection she grew silent thoughtful turning away her face from their notice sat earnestly gazing through window but here elinor could neither wonder nor blame when she saw as she assisted marianne from carriage that she had been crying she saw only emotion too natural itself raise any thing less tender than pity its unobtrusiveness entitled praise whole her subsequent manner she traced direction mind awakened reasonable exertion for no sooner had they entered their common sitting room than marianne turned her eyes around it with look resolute firmness as if determined at once accustom herself sight every object with which remembrance willoughby could be connected she said little but every sentence aimed at cheerfulness though sigh sometimes escaped her it never passed away without atonement smile after dinner she would try her piano forte she went it but music on which her eye first rested was opera procured for her by willoughby containing some their favourite duets bearing on its outward leaf her own name his hand writing that would not do she shook her head put music aside after running over keys for minute complained feebleness her fingers closed instrument again declaring however with firmness as she did so that she should future practice much next morning produced no abatement these happy symptoms on contrary with mind body alike strengthened by rest she looked spoke with more genuine spirit anticipating pleasure margaret s return talking dear family party which would then be restored their mutual pursuits cheerful society as only happiness worth wish when weather is settled i have recovered my strength said she we will take long walks together every day we will walk farm at edge down see how children go on we will walk sir john s new plantations at barton cross abbeyland we will often go old ruins priory try trace its foundations as far as we are told they once reached i know we shall be happy i know summer will pass happily away i mean never be later rising than six from that time till dinner i shall divide every moment between music reading i have formed my plan am determined enter on course serious study our own library is too well known me be resorted for any thing beyond mere amusement but there are many works well worth reading at park there are others more modern production which i know i can borrow colonel brandon by reading only six hours day i shall gain course twelve month great deal instruction which i now feel myself want elinor honoured her for plan which originated so nobly as this though smiling see same eager fancy which had been leading her extreme languid indolence selfish repining now at work introducing excess into scheme such rational employment virtuous self control her smile however changed sigh when she remembered that promise willoughby was yet unfulfilled feared she had that communicate which might again unsettle mind marianne ruin at least for time this fair prospect busy tranquillity willing therefore delay evil hour she resolved wait till her sister s health were more secure before she appointed it but resolution was made only be broken marianne had been two or three days at home before weather was fine enough for invalid like herself venture out but at last soft genial morning appeared such as might tempt daughter s wishes mother s confidence marianne leaning on elinor s arm was authorised walk as long as she could without fatigue lane before house sisters set out at pace slow as feebleness marianne exercise hitherto untried since her illness required they had advanced only so far beyond house as admit full view hill important hill behind when pausing with her eyes turned towards it marianne calmly said there exactly there pointing with one hand on that projecting mound there i fell there i first saw willoughby her voice sunk with word but presently reviving she added i am thankful find that i can look with so little pain on spot shall we ever talk on that subject elinor hesitatingly it was said or will it be wrong i can talk it now i hope as i ought do elinor tenderly invited her be open as for regret said marianne i have done with that as far as he is concerned i do not mean talk you what my feelings have been for him but what they are now at present if i could be satisfied on one point if i could be allowed think that he was not always acting part not always deceiving me but above all if i could be assured that he never was so very wicked as my fears have sometimes fancied him since story that unfortunate girl she stopt elinor joyfully treasured her words as she answered if you could be assured that you think you should be easy yes my peace mind is doubly involved it for not only is it horrible suspect person who has been what he has been me such designs but what must it make me appear myself what situation like mine but most shamefully unguarded affection could expose me how then asked her sister would you account for his behaviour i would suppose him oh how gladly would i suppose him only fickle very very fickle elinor said no more she was debating within herself on eligibility beginning her story directly or postponing it till marianne were stronger health they crept on for few minutes silence i am not wishing him too much good said marianne at last with sigh when i wish his secret reflections may be no more unpleasant than my own he will suffer enough them do you compare your conduct with his no i compare it with what it ought have been i compare it with yours our situations have borne little resemblance they have borne more than our conduct do not my dearest elinor let your kindness defend what i know your judgment must censure my illness has made me think it has given me leisure calmness for serious recollection long before i was enough recovered talk i was perfectly able reflect i considered past i saw my own behaviour since beginning our acquaintance with him last autumn nothing but series imprudence towards myself want kindness others i saw that my own feelings had prepared my sufferings that my want fortitude under them had almost led me grave my illness i well knew had been entirely brought on by myself by such negligence my own health as i had felt even at time be wrong had i died it would have been self destruction i did not know my danger till danger was removed but with such feelings as these reflections gave me i wonder at my recovery wonder that very eagerness my desire live have time for atonement my god you all did not kill me at once had i died what peculiar misery should i have left you my nurse my friend my sister you who had seen all fretful selfishness my latter days who had known all murmurings my heart how should i have lived your remembrance my mother too how could you have consoled her i cannot express my own abhorrence myself whenever i looked towards past i saw some duty neglected or some failing indulged every body seemed injured by me kindness unceasing kindness mrs jennings i had repaid with ungrateful contempt middletons palmers steeles every common acquaintance even i had been insolent unjust with heart hardened against their merits temper irritated by their very attention john fanny yes even them little as they deserve i had given less than their due but you you above all above my mother had been wronged by me i only i knew your heart its sorrows yet what did it influence me not any compassion that could benefit you or myself your example was before me but what avail was i more considerate you your comfort did i imitate your forbearance or lessen your restraints by taking any part those offices general complaisance or particular gratitude which you had hitherto been left discharge alone no not less when i knew you be unhappy than when i had believed you at ease did i turn away from every exertion duty or friendship scarcely allowing sorrow exist but with me regretting only that heart which had deserted wronged me leaving you for whom i professed unbounded affection be miserable for my sake here ceased rapid flow her self reproving spirit elinor impatient soothe though too honest flatter gave her instantly that praise support which her frankness her contrition so well deserved marianne pressed her hand replied you are very good future must be my proof i have laid down my plan if i am capable adhering it my feelings shall be governed my temper improved they shall no longer worry others nor torture myself i shall now live solely for my family you my mother margaret must henceforth be all world me you will share my affections entirely between you from you from my home i shall never again have smallest incitement move if i do mix other society it will be only show that my spirit is humbled my heart amended that i can practise civilities lesser duties life with gentleness forbearance as for willoughby say that i shall soon or that i shall ever forget him would be idle his remembrance can be overcome by no change circumstances or opinions but it shall be regulated it shall be checked by religion by reason by constant employment she paused added low voice if i could but know his heart everything would become easy elinor who had now been for some time reflecting on propriety or impropriety speedily hazarding her narration without feeling at all nearer decision than at first heard this perceiving that as reflection did nothing resolution must do all soon found herself leading fact she managed recital as she hoped with address prepared her anxious listener with caution related simply honestly chief points on which willoughby grounded his apology did justice his repentance softened only his protestations present regard marianne said not word she trembled her eyes were fixed on ground her lips became whiter than even sickness had left them thousand inquiries sprung up from her heart but she dared not urge one she caught every syllable with panting eagerness her hand unknowingly herself closely pressed her sister s tears covered her cheeks elinor dreading her being tired led her towards home till they reached door cottage easily conjecturing what her curiosity must be though no question was suffered speak it talked nothing but willoughby their conversation together was carefully minute every particular speech look where minuteness could be safely indulged as soon as they entered house marianne with kiss gratitude these two words just articulate through her tears tell mama withdrew from her sister walked slowly up stairs elinor would not attempt disturb solitude so reasonable as what she now sought with mind anxiously pre arranging its result resolution reviving subject again should marianne fail do it she turned into parlour fulfill her parting injunction chapter xlvii mrs dashwood did not hear unmoved vindication her former favourite she rejoiced his being cleared from some part his imputed guilt she was sorry for him she wished him happy but feelings past could not be recalled nothing could restore him with faith unbroken character unblemished marianne nothing could do away knowledge what latter had suffered through his means nor remove guilt his conduct towards eliza nothing could replace him therefore her former esteem nor injure interests colonel brandon had mrs dashwood like her daughter heard willoughby s story from himself had she witnessed his distress been under influence his countenance his manner it is probable that her compassion would have been greater but it was neither elinor s power nor her wish rouse such feelings another by her retailed explanation as had at first been called forth herself reflection had given calmness her judgment sobered her own opinion willoughby s deserts she wished therefore declare only simple truth lay open such facts as were really due his character without any embellishment tenderness lead fancy astray evening when they were all three together marianne began voluntarily speak him again but that it was not without effort restless unquiet thoughtfulness which she had been for some time previously sitting her rising colour as she spoke her unsteady voice plainly showed i wish assure you both said she that i see every thing as you can desire me do mrs dashwood would have interrupted her instantly with soothing tenderness had not elinor who really wished hear her sister s unbiased opinion by eager sign engaged her silence marianne slowly continued it is great relief me what elinor told me this morning i have now heard exactly what i wished hear for some moments her voice was lost but recovering herself she added with greater calmness than before i am now perfectly satisfied i wish for no change i never could have been happy with him after knowing as sooner or later i must have known all this i should have had no confidence no esteem nothing could have done it away my feelings i know it i know it cried her mother happy with man libertine practices with one who so injured peace dearest our friends best men no my marianne has not heart be made happy with such man her conscience her sensitive conscience would have felt all that conscience her husband ought have felt marianne sighed repeated i wish for no change you consider matter said elinor exactly as good mind sound understanding must consider it i dare say you perceive as well as myself not only this but many other circumstances reason enough be convinced that your marriage must have involved you many certain troubles disappointments which you would have been poorly supported by affection on his side much less certain had you married you must have been always poor his expensiveness is acknowledged even by himself his whole conduct declares that self denial is word hardly understood by him his demands your inexperience together on small very small income must have brought on distresses which would not be less grievous you from having been entirely unknown unthought before your sense honour honesty would have led you i know when aware your situation attempt all economy that would appear you possible perhaps as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort you might have been suffered practice it but beyond that how little could utmost your single management do stop ruin which had begun before your marriage beyond that had you endeavoured however reasonably abridge his enjoyments is it not be feared that instead prevailing on feelings so selfish consent it you would have lessened your own influence on his heart made him regret connection which had involved him such difficulties marianne s lips quivered she repeated word selfish tone that implied do you really think him selfish whole his behaviour replied elinor from beginning end affair has been grounded on selfishness it was selfishness which first made him sport with your affections which afterwards when his own were engaged made him delay confession it which finally carried him from barton his own enjoyment or his own ease was every particular his ruling principle it is very true my happiness never was his object at present continued elinor he regrets what he has done why does he regret it because he finds it has not answered towards himself it has not made him happy his circumstances are now unembarrassed he suffers from no evil that kind he thinks only that he has married woman less amiable temper than yourself but does it follow that had he married you he would have been happy inconveniences would have been different he would then have suffered under pecuniary distresses which because they are removed he now reckons as nothing he would have had wife whose temper he could make no complaint but he would have been always necessitous always poor probably would soon have learned rank innumerable comforts clear estate good income as far more importance even domestic happiness than mere temper wife i have not doubt it said marianne i have nothing regret nothing but my own folly rather say your mother s imprudence my child said mrs dashwood she must be answerable marianne would not let her proceed elinor satisfied that each felt their own error wished avoid any survey past that might weaken her sister s spirits she therefore pursuing first subject immediately continued one observation may i think be fairly drawn from whole story that all willoughby s difficulties have arisen from first offence against virtue his behaviour eliza williams that crime has been origin every lesser one all his present discontents marianne assented most feelingly remark her mother was led by it enumeration colonel brandon s injuries merits warm as friendship design could unitedly dictate her daughter did not look however as if much it were heard by her elinor according her expectation saw on two or three following days that marianne did not continue gain strength as she had done but while her resolution was unsubdued she still tried appear cheerful easy her sister could safely trust effect time upon her health margaret returned family were again all restored each other again quietly settled at cottage if not pursuing their usual studies with quite so much vigour as when they first came barton at least planning vigorous prosecution them future elinor grew impatient for some tidings edward she had heard nothing him since her leaving london nothing new his plans nothing certain even his present abode some letters had passed between her her brother consequence marianne s illness first john s there had been this sentence we know nothing our unfortunate edward can make no enquiries on so prohibited subject but conclude him be still at oxford which was all intelligence edward afforded her by correspondence for his name was not even mentioned any succeeding letters she was not doomed however be long ignorance his measures their man servant had been sent one morning exeter on business when as he waited at table he had satisfied inquiries his mistress as event his errand this was his voluntary communication i suppose you know ma am that mr ferrars is married marianne gave violent start fixed her eyes upon elinor saw her turning pale fell back her chair hysterics mrs dashwood whose eyes as she answered servant s inquiry had intuitively taken same direction was shocked perceive by elinor s countenance how much she really suffered moment afterwards alike distressed by marianne s situation knew not on which child bestow her principal attention servant who saw only that miss marianne was taken ill had sense enough call one maids who with mrs dashwood s assistance supported her into other room by that time marianne was rather better her mother leaving her care margaret maid returned elinor who though still much disordered had so far recovered use her reason voice as be just beginning inquiry thomas as source his intelligence mrs dashwood immediately took all that trouble on herself elinor had benefit information without exertion seeking it who told you that mr ferrars was married thomas i see mr ferrars myself ma am this morning exeter his lady too miss steele as was they was stopping chaise at door new london inn as i went there with message from sally at park her brother who is one post boys i happened look up as i went by chaise so i see directly it was youngest miss steele so i took off my hat she knew me called me inquired after you ma am young ladies especially miss marianne bid me i should give her compliments mr ferrars s their best compliments service how sorry they was they had not time come on see you but they was great hurry go forwards for they was going further down for little while but howsever when they come back they d make sure come see you but did she tell you she was married thomas yes ma am she smiled said how she had changed her name since she was these parts she was always very affable free spoken young lady very civil behaved so i made free wish her joy was mr ferrars carriage with her yes ma am i just see him leaning back it but he did not look up he never was gentleman much for talking elinor s heart could easily account for his not putting himself forward mrs dashwood probably found same explanation was there no one else carriage no ma am only they two do you know where they came from they come straight from town as miss lucy mrs ferrars told me are they going farther westward yes ma am but not bide long they will soon be back again then they d be sure call here mrs dashwood now looked at her daughter but elinor knew better than expect them she recognised whole lucy message was very confident that edward would never come near them she observed low voice her mother that they were probably going down mr pratt s near plymouth thomas s intelligence seemed over elinor looked as if she wished hear more did you see them off before you came away no ma am horses were just coming out but i could not bide any longer i was afraid being late did mrs ferrars look well yes ma am she said how she was very well my mind she was always very handsome young lady she seemed vastly contented mrs dashwood could think no other question thomas tablecloth now alike needless were soon afterwards dismissed marianne had already sent say that she should eat nothing more mrs dashwood s elinor s appetites were equally lost margaret might think herself very well off that with so much uneasiness as both her sisters had lately experienced so much reason as they had often had be careless their meals she had never been obliged go without her dinner before when dessert wine were arranged mrs dashwood elinor were left by themselves they remained long together similarity thoughtfulness silence mrs dashwood feared hazard any remark ventured not offer consolation she now found that she had erred relying on elinor s representation herself justly concluded that every thing had been expressly softened at time spare her from increase unhappiness suffering as she then had suffered for marianne she found that she had been misled by careful considerate attention her daughter think attachment which once she had so well understood much slighter reality than she had been wont believe or than it was now proved be she feared that under this persuasion she had been unjust inattentive nay almost unkind her elinor that marianne s affliction because more acknowledged more immediately before her had too much engrossed her tenderness led her away forget that elinor she might have daughter suffering almost as much certainly with less self provocation greater fortitude chapter xlviii elinor now found difference between expectation unpleasant event however certain mind may be told consider it certainty itself she now found that spite herself she had always admitted hope while edward remained single that something would occur prevent his marrying lucy that some resolution his own some mediation friends or some more eligible opportunity establishment for lady would arise assist happiness all but he was now married she condemned her heart for lurking flattery which so much heightened pain intelligence that he should be married soon before as she imagined he could be orders consequently before he could be possession living surprised her little at first but she soon saw how likely it was that lucy her self provident care her haste secure him should overlook every thing but risk delay they were married married town now hastening down her uncle s what had edward felt on being within four miles from barton on seeing her mother s servant on hearing lucy s message they would soon she supposed be settled at delaford delaford that place which so much conspired give her interest which she wished be acquainted with yet desired avoid she saw them instant their parsonage house saw lucy active contriving manager uniting at once desire smart appearance with utmost frugality ashamed be suspected half her economical practices pursuing her own interest every thought courting favour colonel brandon mrs jennings every wealthy friend edward she knew not what she saw nor what she wished see happy or unhappy nothing pleased her she turned away her head from every sketch him elinor flattered herself that some one their connections london would write them announce event give farther particulars but day after day passed off brought no letter no tidings though uncertain that any one were blame she found fault with every absent friend they were all thoughtless or indolent when do you write colonel brandon ma am was inquiry which sprung from impatience her mind have something going on i wrote him my love last week rather expect see than hear from him again i earnestly pressed his coming us should not be surprised see him walk today or tomorrow or any day this was gaining something something look forward colonel brandon must have some information give scarcely had she so determined it when figure man on horseback drew her eyes window he stopt at their gate it was gentleman it was colonel brandon himself now she could hear more she trembled expectation it but it was not colonel brandon neither his air nor his height were it possible she must say it must be edward she looked again he had just dismounted she could not be mistaken it was edward she moved away sat down he comes from mr pratt s purposely see us i will be calm i will be mistress myself moment she perceived that others were likewise aware mistake she saw her mother marianne change colour saw them look at herself whisper few sentences each other she would have given world be able speak make them understand that she hoped no coolness no slight would appear their behaviour him but she had no utterance was obliged leave all their own discretion not syllable passed aloud they all waited silence for appearance their visitor his footsteps were heard along gravel path moment he was passage another he was before them his countenance as he entered room was not too happy even for elinor his complexion was white with agitation he looked as if fearful his reception conscious that he merited no kind one mrs dashwood however conforming as she trusted wishes that daughter by whom she then meant warmth her heart be guided every thing met him with look forced complacency gave him her hand wished him joy he coloured stammered out unintelligible reply elinor s lips had moved with her mother s when moment action was over she wished that she had shaken hands with him too but it was then too late with countenance meaning be open she sat down again talked weather marianne had retreated as much as possible out sight conceal her distress margaret understanding some part but not whole case thought it incumbent on her be dignified therefore took seat as far from him as she could maintained strict silence when elinor had ceased rejoice dryness season very awful pause took place it was put end by mrs dashwood who felt obliged hope that he had left mrs ferrars very well hurried manner he replied affirmative another pause elinor resolving exert herself though fearing sound her own voice now said is mrs ferrars at longstaple at longstaple he replied with air surprise no my mother is town i meant said elinor taking up some work from table enquire for mrs edward ferrars she dared not look up but her mother marianne both turned their eyes on him he coloured seemed perplexed looked doubtingly after some hesitation said perhaps you mean my brother you mean mrs mrs robert ferrars mrs robert ferrars was repeated by marianne her mother accent utmost amazement though elinor could not speak even her eyes were fixed on him with same impatient wonder he rose from his seat walked window apparently from not knowing what do took up pair scissors that lay there while spoiling both them their sheath by cutting latter pieces as he spoke said hurried voice perhaps you do not know you may not have heard that my brother is lately married youngest miss lucy steele his words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment by all but elinor who sat with her head leaning over her work state such agitation as made her hardly know where she was yes said he they were married last week are now at dawlish elinor could sit it no longer she almost ran out room as soon as door was closed burst into tears joy which at first she thought would never cease edward who had till then looked any where rather than at her saw her hurry away perhaps saw or even heard her emotion for immediately afterwards he fell into reverie which no remarks no inquiries no affectionate address mrs dashwood could penetrate at last without saying word quitted room walked out towards village leaving others greatest astonishment perplexity on change his situation so wonderful so sudden perplexity which they had no means lessening but by their own conjectures chapter xlix unaccountable however as circumstances his release might appear whole family it was certain that edward was free what purpose that freedom would be employed was easily pre determined by all for after experiencing blessings one imprudent engagement contracted without his mother s consent as he had already done for more than four years nothing less could be expected him failure that than immediate contraction another his errand at barton fact was simple one it was only ask elinor marry him considering that he was not altogether inexperienced such question it might be strange that he should feel so uncomfortable present case as he really did so much need encouragement fresh air how soon he had walked himself into proper resolution however how soon opportunity exercising it occurred what manner he expressed himself how he was received need not be particularly told this only need be said that when they all sat down table at four o clock about three hours after his arrival he had secured his lady engaged her mother s consent was not only rapturous profession lover but reality reason truth one happiest men his situation indeed was more than commonly joyful he had more than ordinary triumph accepted love swell his heart raise his spirits he was released without any reproach himself from entanglement which had long formed his misery from woman whom he had long ceased love elevated at once that security with another which he must have thought almost with despair as soon as he had learnt consider it with desire he was brought not from doubt or suspense but from misery happiness change was openly spoken such genuine flowing grateful cheerfulness as his friends had never witnessed him before his heart was now open elinor all its weaknesses all its errors confessed his first boyish attachment lucy treated with all philosophic dignity twenty four it was foolish idle inclination on my side said he consequence ignorance world want employment had my mother given me some active profession when i was removed at eighteen from care mr pratt i think nay i am sure it would never have happened for though i left longstaple with what i thought at time most unconquerable preference for his niece yet had i then had any pursuit any object engage my time keep me at distance from her for few months i should very soon have outgrown fancied attachment especially by mixing more with world as such case i must have done but instead having any thing do instead having any profession chosen for me or being allowed chuse any myself i returned home be completely idle for first twelvemonth afterwards i had not even nominal employment which belonging university would have given me for i was not entered at oxford till i was nineteen i had therefore nothing world do but fancy myself love as my mother did not make my home every respect comfortable as i had no friend no companion my brother disliked new acquaintance it was not unnatural for me be very often at longstaple where i always felt myself at home was always sure welcome accordingly i spent greatest part my time there from eighteen nineteen lucy appeared everything that was amiable obliging she was pretty too at least i thought so then i had seen so little other women that i could make no comparisons see no defects considering everything therefore i hope foolish as our engagement was foolish as it has since every way been proved it was not at time unnatural or inexcusable piece folly change which few hours had wrought minds happiness dashwoods was such so great as promised them all satisfaction sleepless night mrs dashwood too happy be comfortable knew not how love edward nor praise elinor enough how be enough thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy nor how at once give them leisure for unrestrained conversation together yet enjoy as she wished sight society both marianne could speak her happiness only by tears comparisons would occur regrets would arise her joy though sincere as her love for her sister was kind give her neither spirits nor language but elinor how are her feelings be described from moment learning that lucy was married another that edward was free moment his justifying hopes which had so instantly followed she was every thing by turns but tranquil but when second moment had passed when she found every doubt every solicitude removed compared her situation with what so lately it had been saw him honourably released from his former engagement saw him instantly profiting by release address herself declare affection as tender as constant as she had ever supposed it be she was oppressed she was overcome by her own felicity happily disposed as is human mind be easily familiarized with any change for better it required several hours give sedateness her spirits or any degree tranquillity her heart edward was now fixed at cottage at least for week for whatever other claims might be made on him it was impossible that less than week should be given up enjoyment elinor s company or suffice say half that was be said past present future for though very few hours spent hard labor incessant talking will despatch more subjects than can really be common between any two rational creatures yet with lovers it is different between them no subject is finished no communication is even made till it has been made at least twenty times over lucy s marriage unceasing reasonable wonder among them all formed course one earliest discussions lovers elinor s particular knowledge each party made it appear her every view as one most extraordinary unaccountable circumstances she had ever heard how they could be thrown together by what attraction robert could be drawn on marry girl whose beauty she had herself heard him speak without any admiration girl too already engaged his brother on whose account that brother had been thrown off by his family it was beyond her comprehension make out her own heart it was delightful affair her imagination it was even ridiculous one but her reason her judgment it was completely puzzle edward could only attempt explanation by supposing that perhaps at first accidentally meeting vanity one had been so worked on by flattery other as lead by degrees all rest elinor remembered what robert had told her harley street his opinion what his own mediation his brother s affairs might have done if applied time she repeated it edward that was exactly like robert was his immediate observation that he presently added might perhaps be his head when acquaintance between them first began lucy perhaps at first might think only procuring his good offices my favour other designs might afterward arise how long it had been carrying on between them however he was equally at loss with herself make out for at oxford where he had remained for choice ever since his quitting london he had had no means hearing her but from herself her letters very last were neither less frequent nor less affectionate than usual not smallest suspicion therefore had ever occurred prepare him for what followed when at last it burst on him letter from lucy herself he had been for some time he believed half stupified between wonder horror joy such deliverance he put letter into elinor s hands dear sir being very sure i have long lost your affections i have thought myself at liberty bestow my own on another have no doubt being as happy with him as i once used think i might be with you but i scorn accept hand while heart was another s sincerely wish you happy your choice it shall not be my fault if we are not always good friends as our near relationship now makes proper i can safely say i owe you no ill will am sure you will be too generous do us any ill offices your brother has gained my affections entirely as we could not live without one another we are just returned from altar are now on our way dawlish for few weeks which place your dear brother has great curiosity see but thought i would first trouble you with these few lines shall always remain your sincere well wisher friend sister lucy ferrars i have burnt all your letters will return your picture first opportunity please destroy my scrawls but ring with my hair you are very welcome keep elinor read returned it without any comment i will not ask your opinion it as composition said edward for worlds would not i have had letter hers seen by you former days sister it is bad enough but wife how i have blushed over pages her writing i believe i may say that since first half year our foolish business this is only letter i ever received from her which substance made me any amends for defect style however it may have come about said elinor after pause they are certainly married your mother has brought on herself most appropriate punishment independence she settled on robert through resentment against you has put it his power make his own choice she has actually been bribing one son with thousand year do very deed which she disinherited other for intending do she will hardly be less hurt i suppose by robert s marrying lucy than she would have been by your marrying her she will be more hurt by it for robert always was her favourite she will be more hurt by it on same principle will forgive him much sooner what state affair stood at present between them edward knew not for no communication with any his family had yet been attempted by him he had quitted oxford within four twenty hours after lucy s letter arrived with only one object before him nearest road barton had had no leisure form any scheme conduct with which that road did not hold most intimate connection he could do nothing till he were assured his fate with miss dashwood by his rapidity seeking that fate it is be supposed spite jealousy with which he had once thought colonel brandon spite modesty with which he rated his own deserts politeness with which he talked his doubts he did not upon whole expect very cruel reception it was his business however say that he did he said it very prettily what he might say on subject twelvemonth after must be referred imagination husbands wives that lucy had certainly meant deceive go off with flourish malice against him her message by thomas was perfectly clear elinor edward himself now thoroughly enlightened on her character had no scruple believing her capable utmost meanness wanton ill nature though his eyes had been long opened even before his acquaintance with elinor began her ignorance want liberality some her opinions they had been equally imputed by him her want education till her last letter reached him he had always believed her be well disposed good hearted girl thoroughly attached himself nothing but such persuasion could have prevented his putting end engagement which long before discovery it laid him open his mother s anger had been continual source disquiet regret him i thought it my duty said he independent my feelings give her option continuing engagement or not when i was renounced by my mother stood all appearance without friend world assist me such situation as that where there seemed nothing tempt avarice or vanity any living creature how could i suppose when she so earnestly so warmly insisted on sharing my fate whatever it might be that any thing but most disinterested affection was her inducement even now i cannot comprehend on what motive she acted or what fancied advantage it could be her be fettered man for whom she had not smallest regard who had only two thousand pounds world she could not foresee that colonel brandon would give me living no but she might suppose that something would occur your favour that your own family might time relent at any rate she lost nothing by continuing engagement for she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination nor her actions connection was certainly respectable one probably gained her consideration among her friends if nothing more advantageous occurred it would be better for her marry you than be single edward was course immediately convinced that nothing could have been more natural than lucy s conduct nor more self evident than motive it elinor scolded him harshly as ladies always scold imprudence which compliments themselves for having spent so much time with them at norland when he must have felt his own inconstancy your behaviour was certainly very wrong said she because say nothing my own conviction our relations were all led away by it fancy expect what as you were then situated could never be he could only plead ignorance his own heart mistaken confidence force his engagement i was simple enough think that because my faith was plighted another there could be no danger my being with you that consciousness my engagement was keep my heart as safe sacred as my honour i felt that i admired you but i told myself it was only friendship till i began make comparisons between yourself lucy i did not know how far i was got after that i suppose i was wrong remaining so much sussex arguments with which i reconciled myself expediency it were no better than these danger is my own i am doing no injury anybody but myself elinor smiled shook her head edward heard with pleasure colonel brandon s being expected at cottage as he really wished not only be better acquainted with him but have opportunity convincing him that he no longer resented his giving him living delaford which at present said he after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on occasion he must think i have never forgiven him for offering now he felt astonished himself that he had never yet been place but so little interest had he taken matter that he owed all his knowledge house garden glebe extent parish condition land rate tithes elinor herself who had heard so much it from colonel brandon heard it with so much attention as be entirely mistress subject one question after this only remained undecided between them one difficulty only was be overcome they were brought together by mutual affection with warmest approbation their real friends their intimate knowledge each other seemed make their happiness certain they only wanted something live upon edward had two thousand pounds elinor one which with delaford living was all that they could call their own for it was impossible that mrs dashwood should advance anything they were neither them quite enough love think that three hundred fifty pounds year would supply them with comforts life edward was not entirely without hopes some favourable change his mother towards him on that he rested for residue their income but elinor had no such dependence for since edward would still be unable marry miss morton his chusing herself had been spoken mrs ferrars s flattering language as only lesser evil than his chusing lucy steele she feared that robert s offence would serve no other purpose than enrich fanny about four days after edward s arrival colonel brandon appeared complete mrs dashwood s satisfaction give her dignity having for first time since her living at barton more company with her than her house would hold edward was allowed retain privilege first comer colonel brandon therefore walked every night his old quarters at park from whence he usually returned morning early enough interrupt lovers first t te t te before breakfast three weeks residence at delaford where his evening hours at least he had little do but calculate disproportion between thirty six seventeen brought him barton temper mind which needed all improvement marianne s looks all kindness her welcome all encouragement her mother s language make it cheerful among such friends however such flattery he did revive no rumour lucy s marriage had yet reached him he knew nothing what had passed first hours his visit were consequently spent hearing wondering every thing was explained him by mrs dashwood he found fresh reason rejoice what he had done for mr ferrars since eventually it promoted interest elinor it would be needless say that gentlemen advanced good opinion each other as they advanced each other s acquaintance for it could not be otherwise their resemblance good principles good sense disposition manner thinking would probably have been sufficient unite them friendship without any other attraction but their being love with two sisters two sisters fond each other made that mutual regard inevitable immediate which might otherwise have waited effect time judgment letters from town which few days before would have made every nerve elinor s body thrill with transport now arrived be read with less emotion than mirth mrs jennings wrote tell wonderful tale vent her honest indignation against jilting girl pour forth her compassion towards poor mr edward who she was sure had quite doted upon worthless hussy was now by all accounts almost broken hearted at oxford i do think she continued nothing was ever carried on so sly for it was but two days before lucy called sat couple hours with me not soul suspected anything matter not even nancy who poor soul came crying me day after great fright for fear mrs ferrars as well as not knowing how get plymouth for lucy it seems borrowed all her money before she went off be married on purpose we suppose make show with poor nancy had not seven shillings world so i was very glad give her five guineas take her down exeter where she thinks staying three or four weeks with mrs burgess hopes as i tell her fall with doctor again i must say that lucy s crossness not take them along with them chaise is worse than all poor mr edward i cannot get him out my head but you must send for him barton miss marianne must try comfort him mr dashwood s strains were more solemn mrs ferrars was most unfortunate women poor fanny had suffered agonies sensibility he considered existence each under such blow with grateful wonder robert s offence was unpardonable but lucy s was infinitely worse neither them were ever again be mentioned mrs ferrars even if she might hereafter be induced forgive her son his wife should never be acknowledged as her daughter nor be permitted appear her presence secrecy with which everything had been carried on between them was rationally treated as enormously heightening crime because had any suspicion it occurred others proper measures would have been taken prevent marriage he called on elinor join with him regretting that lucy s engagement with edward had not rather been fulfilled than that she should thus be means spreading misery farther family he thus continued mrs ferrars has never yet mentioned edward s name which does not surprise us but our great astonishment not line has been received from him on occasion perhaps however he is kept silent by his fear offending i shall therefore give him hint by line oxford that his sister i both think letter proper submission from him addressed perhaps fanny by her shown her mother might not be taken amiss for we all know tenderness mrs ferrars s heart that she wishes for nothing so much as be on good terms with her children this paragraph was some importance prospects conduct edward it determined him attempt reconciliation though not exactly manner pointed out by their brother sister letter proper submission repeated he would they have me beg my mother s pardon for robert s ingratitude her breach honour me i can make no submission i am grown neither humble nor penitent by what has passed i am grown very happy but that would not interest i know no submission that is proper for me make you may certainly ask be forgiven said elinor because you have offended i should think you might now venture so far as profess some concern for having ever formed engagement which drew on you your mother s anger he agreed that he might when she has forgiven you perhaps little humility may be convenient while acknowledging second engagement almost as imprudent her eyes as first he had nothing urge against it but still resisted idea letter proper submission therefore make it easier him as he declared much greater willingness make mean concessions by word mouth than on paper it was resolved that instead writing fanny he should go london personally intreat her good offices his favour if they really do interest themselves said marianne her new character candour bringing about reconciliation i shall think that even john fanny are not entirely without merit after visit on colonel brandon s side only three or four days two gentlemen quitted barton together they were go immediately delaford that edward might have some personal knowledge his future home assist his patron friend deciding on what improvements were needed it from thence after staying there couple nights he was proceed on his journey town chapter l after proper resistance on part mrs ferrars just so violent so steady as preserve her from that reproach which she always seemed fearful incurring reproach being too amiable edward was admitted her presence pronounced be again her son her family had late been exceedingly fluctuating for many years her life she had had two sons but crime annihilation edward few weeks ago had robbed her one similar annihilation robert had left her for fortnight without any now by resuscitation edward she had one again spite his being allowed once more live however he did not feel continuance his existence secure till he had revealed his present engagement for publication that circumstance he feared might give sudden turn his constitution carry him off as rapidly as before with apprehensive caution therefore it was revealed he was listened with unexpected calmness mrs ferrars at first reasonably endeavoured dissuade him from marrying miss dashwood by every argument her power told him that miss morton he would have woman higher rank larger fortune enforced assertion by observing that miss morton was daughter nobleman with thirty thousand pounds while miss dashwood was only daughter private gentleman with no more than three but when she found that though perfectly admitting truth her representation he was by no means inclined be guided by it she judged it wisest from experience past submit therefore after such ungracious delay as she owed her own dignity as served prevent every suspicion good will she issued her decree consent marriage edward elinor what she would engage do towards augmenting their income was next be considered here it plainly appeared that though edward was now her only son he was by no means her eldest for while robert was inevitably endowed with thousand pounds year not smallest objection was made against edward s taking orders for sake two hundred fifty at utmost nor was anything promised either for present or future beyond ten thousand pounds which had been given with fanny it was as much however as was desired more than was expected by edward elinor mrs ferrars herself by her shuffling excuses seemed only person surprised at her not giving more with income quite sufficient their wants thus secured them they had nothing wait for after edward was possession living but readiness house which colonel brandon with eager desire for accommodation elinor was making considerable improvements after waiting some time for their completion after experiencing as usual thousand disappointments delays from unaccountable dilatoriness workmen elinor as usual broke through first positive resolution not marrying till every thing was ready ceremony took place barton church early autumn first month after their marriage was spent with their friend at mansion house from whence they could superintend progress parsonage direct every thing as they liked on spot could chuse papers project shrubberies invent sweep mrs jennings s prophecies though rather jumbled together were chiefly fulfilled for she was able visit edward his wife their parsonage by michaelmas she found elinor her husband as she really believed one happiest couples world they had fact nothing wish for but marriage colonel brandon marianne rather better pasturage for their cows they were visited on their first settling by almost all their relations friends mrs ferrars came inspect happiness which she was almost ashamed having authorised even dashwoods were at expense journey from sussex do them honour i will not say that i am disappointed my dear sister said john as they were walking together one morning before gates delaford house that would be saying too much for certainly you have been one most fortunate young women world as it is but i confess it would give me great pleasure call colonel brandon brother his property here his place his house every thing is such respectable excellent condition his woods i have not seen such timber any where dorsetshire as there is now standing delaford hanger though perhaps marianne may not seem exactly person attract him yet i think it would altogether be advisable for you have them now frequently staying with you for as colonel brandon seems great deal at home nobody can tell what may happen for when people are much thrown together see little anybody else it will always be your power set her off advantage so forth short you may as well give her chance you understand me but though mrs ferrars did come see them always treated them with make believe decent affection they were never insulted by her real favour preference that was due folly robert cunning his wife it was earned by them before many months had passed away selfish sagacity latter which had at first drawn robert into scrape was principal instrument his deliverance from it for her respectful humility assiduous attentions endless flatteries as soon as smallest opening was given for their exercise reconciled mrs ferrars his choice re established him completely her favour whole lucy s behaviour affair prosperity which crowned it therefore may be held forth as most encouraging instance what earnest unceasing attention self interest however its progress may be apparently obstructed will do securing every advantage fortune with no other sacrifice than that time conscience when robert first sought her acquaintance privately visited her bartlett s buildings it was only with view imputed him by his brother he merely meant persuade her give up engagement as there could be nothing overcome but affection both he naturally expected that one or two interviews would settle matter that point however that only he erred for though lucy soon gave him hopes that his eloquence would convince her time another visit another conversation was always wanted produce this conviction some doubts always lingered her mind when they parted which could only be removed by another half hour s discourse with himself his attendance was by this means secured rest followed course instead talking edward they came gradually talk only robert subject on which he had always more say than on any other which she soon betrayed interest even equal his own short it became speedily evident both that he had entirely supplanted his brother he was proud his conquest proud tricking edward very proud marrying privately without his mother s consent what immediately followed is known they passed some months great happiness at dawlish for she had many relations old acquaintances cut he drew several plans for magnificent cottages from thence returning town procured forgiveness mrs ferrars by simple expedient asking it which at lucy s instigation was adopted forgiveness at first indeed as was reasonable comprehended only robert lucy who had owed his mother no duty therefore could have transgressed none still remained some weeks longer unpardoned but perseverance humility conduct messages self condemnation for robert s offence gratitude for unkindness she was treated with procured her time haughty notice which overcame her by its graciousness led soon afterwards by rapid degrees highest state affection influence lucy became as necessary mrs ferrars as either robert or fanny while edward was never cordially forgiven for having once intended marry her elinor though superior her fortune birth was spoken as intruder she was every thing considered always openly acknowledged be favourite child they settled town received very liberal assistance from mrs ferrars were on best terms imaginable with dashwoods setting aside jealousies ill will continually subsisting between fanny lucy which their husbands course took part as well as frequent domestic disagreements between robert lucy themselves nothing could exceed harmony which they all lived together what edward had done forfeit right eldest son might have puzzled many people find out what robert had done succeed it might have puzzled them still more it was arrangement however justified its effects if not its cause for nothing ever appeared robert s style living or talking give suspicion his regretting extent his income as either leaving his brother too little or bringing himself too much if edward might be judged from ready discharge his duties every particular from increasing attachment his wife his home from regular cheerfulness his spirits he might be supposed no less contented with his lot no less free from every wish exchange elinor s marriage divided her as little from her family as could well be contrived without rendering cottage at barton entirely useless for her mother sisters spent much more than half their time with her mrs dashwood was acting on motives policy as well as pleasure frequency her visits at delaford for her wish bringing marianne colonel brandon together was hardly less earnest though rather more liberal than what john had expressed it was now her darling object precious as was company her daughter her she desired nothing so much as give up its constant enjoyment her valued friend see marianne settled at mansion house was equally wish edward elinor they each felt his sorrows their own obligations marianne by general consent was be reward all with such confederacy against her with knowledge so intimate his goodness with conviction his fond attachment herself which at last though long after it was observable everybody else burst on her what could she do marianne dashwood was born extraordinary fate she was born discover falsehood her own opinions counteract by her conduct her most favourite maxims she was born overcome affection formed so late life as at seventeen with no sentiment superior strong esteem lively friendship voluntarily give her hand another that other man who had suffered no less than herself under event former attachment whom two years before she had considered too old be married who still sought constitutional safeguard flannel waistcoat but so it was instead falling sacrifice irresistible passion as once she had fondly flattered herself with expecting instead remaining even for ever with her mother finding her only pleasures retirement study as afterwards her more calm sober judgment she had determined on she found herself at nineteen submitting new attachments entering on new duties placed new home wife mistress family patroness village colonel brandon was now as happy as all those who best loved him believed he deserved be marianne he was consoled for every past affliction her regard her society restored his mind animation his spirits cheerfulness that marianne found her own happiness forming his was equally persuasion delight each observing friend marianne could never love by halves her whole heart became time as much devoted her husband as it had once been willoughby willoughby could not hear her marriage without pang his punishment was soon afterwards complete voluntary forgiveness mrs smith who by stating his marriage with woman character as source her clemency gave him reason for believing that had he behaved with honour towards marianne he might at once have been happy rich that his repentance misconduct which thus brought its own punishment was sincere need not be doubted nor that he long thought colonel brandon with envy marianne with regret but that he was for ever inconsolable that he fled from society or contracted habitual gloom temper or died broken heart must not be depended on for he did neither he lived exert frequently enjoy himself his wife was not always out humour nor his home always uncomfortable his breed horses dogs sporting every kind he found no inconsiderable degree domestic felicity for marianne however spite his incivility surviving her loss he always retained that decided regard which interested him every thing that befell her made her his secret standard perfection woman many rising beauty would be slighted by him after days as bearing no comparison with mrs brandon mrs dashwood was prudent enough remain at cottage without attempting removal delaford fortunately for sir john mrs jennings when marianne was taken from them margaret had reached age highly suitable for dancing not very ineligible for being supposed have lover between barton delaford there was that constant communication which strong family affection would naturally dictate among merits happiness elinor marianne let it not be ranked as least considerable that though sisters living almost within sight each other they could live without disagreement between themselves or producing coolness between

feigned hand there can be no suspicion whence they came lady sneerwell did you circulate report lady brittle s intrigue with captain boastall verjuice madam by this time lady brittle is talk half town i doubt not week men will toast her as demirep lady sneerwell what have you done as insinuation as certain baronet s lady certain cook verjuice that is as fine train as your ladyship could wish i told story yesterday my own maid with directions communicate it directly my hairdresser he i am informed has brother who courts milliners prentice pallmall whose mistress has first cousin whose sister is feme femme de chambre mrs clackit so that common course things it must reach mrs clackit s ears within four twenty hours then you know business is as good as done lady sneerwell why truly mrs clackit

out doors three several elopements as many close confinements nine separate maintenances two divorces nay i have more than once traced her causing tete tete town country magazine when parties perhaps

bold invention but her colouring is too dark her outline often extravagant she wants that delicacy tint mellowness sneer which distinguish your ladyship s scandal lady sneerwell ah you are partial verjuice verjuice not least everybody allows that lady sneerwell can do more with word or look than many can with most laboured detail even when they happen have little truth on their side support it lady sneerwell yes my dear verjuice i am no hypocrite deny satisfaction i reap from success my efforts wounded myself early part my life by envenomed tongue slander i confess i have since known no

verjuice entirely so lady sneerwell verjuice old batchelor as sir peter was having taken young wife from out country as lady teazle is are certainly fair subjects for little mischievous raillery but here are two young men whom sir peter has acted as kind guardian since their father s death eldest possessing most amiable character universally well spoken youngest most dissipated extravagant young fellow kingdom without friends or caracter former one avowed admirer yours apparently your favourite latter attached maria sir peter s ward confessedly beloved by her now on face these circumstances it is utterly unaccountable me why you young widow with no great jointure should not close with passion man such character expectations as mr surface more so why you should be so uncommonly earnest destroy mutual attachment subsisting between his brother charles maria lady sneerwell then at once unravel this mistery i must inform you that love has no share whatever intercourse between mr surface me verjuice no lady sneerwell his real attachment is maria or her fortune but finding his brother favoured rival he has been obliged mask his pretensions profit by my assistance verjuice yet still i am more puzzled why you should interest yourself his success lady sneerwell heavens how dull you are cannot you surmise weakness which i hitherto thro shame have concealed even from you must i confess that charles that libertine that extravagant that bankrupt fortune reputation that he it is for whom i am thus anxious malicious gain whom i would sacrifice everything verjuice now indeed your conduct appears consistent i no longer wonder at your enmity maria but how came you surface so confidential lady sneerwell for our mutual interest but i have found out him long time since altho he has contrived deceive everybody beside i know him be artful selfish malicious while with sir peter indeed with all his acquaintance he passes for youthful miracle prudence good sense benevolence verjuice yes yes i know sir peter vows he has not his equal england above all he praises him as man sentiment lady sneerwell true with assistance his sentiments hypocrisy he has brought sir peter entirely his interests with respect maria is now i believe attempting flatter lady teazle into same good opinion towards him while poor charles has no friend house though i fear he has powerful one maria s heart against whom we must direct our schemes servant mr surface lady sneerwell shew him up he generally calls about this time i don t wonder at people s giving him me for lover enter surface surface my dear lady sneerwell how do you do day your most obedient lady sneerwell miss verjuice has just been arraigning me on our mutual attachment now but i have informed her our real views purposes for which our geniuses at present co operate you know how useful she has been us believe me confidence is not ill placed surface madam it is impossible for me suspect that lady miss verjuice s sensibility discernment lady sneerwell well well no compliments now but tell me when you saw your mistress or what is more material me your brother surface i have not seen either since i saw you but i can inform you that they are at present at variance some your stories have taken good effect on maria lady sneerwell ah my dear verjuice merit this belongs you but do your brother s distresses encrease surface every hour i am told he had another execution his house yesterday short his dissipation extravagance exceed anything i have ever heard lady sneerwell poor charles surface true madam notwithstanding his vices one can t help feeling for him ah poor charles i m sure i wish it was my power be any essential service him for man who does not share distresses brother even though merited by his own misconduct deserves lady sneerwell o lud you are going be moral forget that you are among friends surface egad that s true i ll keep that sentiment till i see sir peter however it is certainly charity rescue maria from such libertine who if he is be reclaim d can be so only by person your ladyship s superior accomplishments understanding verjuice twould be hazardous experiment surface but madam let me caution you place no more confidence our friend snake libeller i have lately detected him frequent conference with old rowland rowley who was formerly my father s steward has never been friend mine

matter is maria heard you were here but my dear what has sir benjamin done that you should avoid him so maria oh he has done nothing but his conversation is perpetual libel on all his acquaintance surface aye worst it is there is no advantage not knowing them for he ll abuse stranger just as soon as his best friend crabtree is as bad lady sneerwell nay but we should make allowance sir benjamin is wit poet maria for my part i own madam wit loses its respect with me when i see it company with malice what do you think mr surface surface certainly madam smile at jest which plants thorn on another s breast is become principal mischief lady sneerwell pshaw there s no possibility being witty without little ill nature malice good thing is barb that makes it stick what s your opinion mr surface surface certainly madam that conversation where spirit raillery is suppressed will ever appear tedious insipid maria well i ll not debate how far scandal may be allowable but man i am sure it is always contemtable we have pride envy rivalship thousand motives depreciate each other but male slanderer must have cowardice woman before he can traduce one lady sneerwell i wish my cousin verjuice hadn t left us she should embrace you surface ah she s old maid is privileged course enter servant madam mrs candour is below if your ladyship s at leisure will leave her carriage lady sneerwell beg her walk now maria however here is character your taste for tho mrs candour is little talkative everybody allows her be best natured best sort woman maria yes with very gross affectation

shameful shameful but world is so censorious no character escapes lord now who would have suspected your friend miss prim indiscretion yet such is ill nature people that they say her unkle stopped her last week just as she was stepping into postchaise with her dancing master maria i ll answer for t there are no grounds for report mrs candour oh no foundation world i dare swear no more probably than for story circulated last month mrs festino s affair with colonel cassino tho be sure that matter was never rightly clear d up surface license invention some people take is monstrous indeed maria tis so but my opinion those who report such things are equally culpable mrs candour be sure they are tale bearers are as bad as tale makers tis old observation very true one but what s be done as i said before how will you prevent people from talking day mrs clackitt assured me mr mrs honeymoon were at last become mere man wife like rest their acquaintance she likewise hinted that certain widow next

city that is always novelty home again appendix b c d body nation but basin mississippi is body nation all other parts are but members important themselves yet more important their relations this exclusive lake basin 300 000 square miles texas new mexico which many aspects form part it this basin contains about 1 250 000 square miles extent it is second great valley world being exceeded only by that amazon valley frozen obi approaches it extent that la plata comes next space probably habitable capacity having about eight ninths its area then comes that yenisei with about seven ninths lena amoor hoang ho yang tse kiang nile five ninths ganges less than one half indus less than one third euphrates one fifth rhine one fifteenth it exceeds extent whole europe exclusive russia norway sweden it would contain austria four times germany or spain five times france six times british islands or italy ten times conceptions formed from river basins western europe are rudely shocked when we consider extent valley mississippi nor are those formed from sterile basins great rivers siberia lofty plateaus central asia or mighty sweep swampy amazon more adequate latitude elevation rainfall all combine render every part mississippi valley capable supporting dense population as dwelling place for civilized man it is by far first upon our globe editor s table harper s magazine february 1863 chapter 1 river its history mississippi is well worth reading about it is not commonplace river but on contrary is all ways remarkable considering missouri its main branch it is longest river world four thousand three hundred miles it seems safe say that it is also crookedest river world since one part its journey it uses up one thousand three hundred miles cover same ground that crow would fly over six hundred seventy five it discharges three times as much water as st lawrence twenty five times as much as rhine three hundred thirty eight times as much as thames no other river has so vast drainage basin it draws its water supply from twenty eight states territories from delaware on atlantic seaboard from all country between that idaho on pacific slope spread forty five degrees longitude mississippi receives carries gulf water from fifty four subordinate rivers that are navigable by steamboats from some hundreds that are navigable by flats keels area its drainage basin is as great as combined areas england wales scotland ireland france spain portugal germany austria italy turkey almost all this wide region is fertile mississippi valley proper is exceptionally so it is remarkable river this that instead widening toward its mouth it grows narrower grows narrower deeper from junction ohio point half way down sea width averages mile high water thence sea width steadily diminishes until at passes above mouth it is but little over half mile at junction ohio mississippi s depth is eighty seven feet depth increases gradually reaching one hundred twenty nine just above mouth difference rise fall is also remarkable not upper but lower river rise is tolerably uniform down natchez three hundred sixty miles above mouth about fifty feet but at bayou la fourche river rises only twenty four feet at new orleans only fifteen just above mouth only two one half article new orleans times democrat based upon reports able engineers states that river annually empties four hundred six million tons mud into gulf mexico which brings mind captain marryat s rude name for mississippi great sewer this mud solidified would make mass mile square two hundred forty one feet high mud deposit gradually extends land but only gradually it has extended it not quite third mile two hundred years which have elapsed since river took its place history belief scientific people is that mouth used be at baton rouge where hills cease that two hundred miles land between there gulf was built by river this gives us age that piece country without any trouble at all one hundred twenty thousand years yet it is much youthfullest batch country that lies around there anywhere mississippi is remarkable still another way its disposition make prodigious jumps by cutting through narrow necks land thus straightening shortening itself more than once it has shortened itself thirty miles at single jump these cut offs have had curious effects they have thrown several river towns out into rural districts built up sand bars forests front them town delta used be three miles below vicksburg recent cutoff has radically changed position delta is now two miles above vicksburg both these river towns have been retired country by that cut off cut off plays havoc with boundary lines jurisdictions for instance man is living state mississippi day cut off occurs night morrow man finds himself his land over on other side river within boundaries subject laws state louisiana such thing happening upper river old times could have transferred slave from missouri illinois made free man him mississippi does not alter its locality by cut offs alone it is always changing its habitat bodily is always moving bodily sidewise at hard times la river is two miles west region it used occupy as result original site that settlement is not now louisiana at all but on other side river state mississippi nearly whole that one thousand three hundred miles old mississippi river which la salle floated down his canoes two hundred years ago is good solid dry ground now river lies right it places left it other places although mississippi s mud builds land but slowly down at mouth where gulfs billows interfere with its work it builds fast enough better protected regions higher up for instance prophet s island contained one thousand five hundred acres land thirty years ago since then river has added seven hundred acres it but enough these examples mighty stream s eccentricities for present i will give few more them further along book let us drop mississippi s physical history say word about its historical history so speak we can glance briefly at its slumbrous first epoch couple short chapters at its second wider awake epoch couple more at its flushest widest awake epoch good many succeeding chapters then talk about its comparatively tranquil present epoch what shall be left book world books are so accustomed use over use word new connection with our country that we early get permanently retain impression that there is nothing old about it we do course know that there are several comparatively old dates american history but mere figures convey our minds no just idea no distinct realization stretch time which they represent say that de soto first white man who ever saw mississippi river saw it 1542 is remark which states fact without interpreting it it is something like giving dimensions sunset by astronomical measurements cataloguing colors by their scientific names as result you get bald fact sunset but you don t see sunset it would have been better paint picture it date 1542 standing by itself means little or nothing us but when one groups few neighboring historical dates facts around it he adds perspective color then realizes that this is one american dates which is quite respectable for age for instance when mississippi was first seen by white man less than quarter century had elapsed since francis i s defeat at pavia death raphael death bayard sans peur et sans reproche driving out knights hospitallers from rhodes by turks placarding ninety five propositions act which began reformation when de soto took his glimpse river ignatius loyola was obscure name order jesuits was not yet year old michael angelo s paint was not yet dry on last judgment sistine chapel mary queen scots was not yet born but would be before year closed catherine de medici was child elizabeth england was not yet her teens calvin benvenuto cellini emperor charles v were at top their fame each was manufacturing history after his own peculiar fashion margaret navarre was writing heptameron some religious books first survives others are forgotten wit indelicacy being sometimes better literature preservers than holiness lax court morals absurd chivalry business were full feather joust tournament were frequent pastime titled fine gentlemen who could fight better than they could spell while religion was passion their ladies classifying their offspring into children full rank children by brevet their pastime fact all around religion was peculiarly blooming condition council trent was being called spanish inquisition was roasting racking burning with free hand elsewhere on continent nations were being persuaded holy living by sword fire england henry viii had suppressed monasteries burnt fisher another bishop or two was getting his english reformation his harem effectively started when de soto stood on banks mississippi it was still two years before luther s death eleven years before burning servetus thirty years before st bartholomew slaughter rabelais was not yet published don quixote was not yet written shakespeare was not yet born hundred long years must still elapse before englishmen would hear name oliver cromwell unquestionably discovery mississippi is datable fact which considerably mellows modifies shiny newness our country gives her most respectable outside aspect rustiness antiquity de soto merely glimpsed river then died was buried it by his priests soldiers one would expect priests soldiers multiply river s dimensions by ten spanish custom day thus move other adventurers go at once explore it on contrary their narratives when they reached home did not excite that amount curiosity mississippi was left unvisited by whites during term years which seems incredible our energetic days one may sense interval his mind after fashion by dividing it up this way after de soto glimpsed river fraction short quarter century elapsed then shakespeare was born lived trifle more than half century then died when he had been his grave considerably more than half century second white man saw mississippi our day we don t allow hundred thirty years elapse between glimpses marvel if somebody should discover creek county next one that north pole is europe america would start fifteen costly expeditions thither one explore creek other fourteen hunt for each other for more than hundred fifty years there had been white settlements on our atlantic coasts these people were intimate communication with indians south spaniards were robbing slaughtering enslaving converting them higher up english were trading beads blankets them for consideration throwing civilization whiskey for lagniappe canada french were schooling them rudimentary way missionarying among them drawing whole populations them at time quebec later montreal buy furs them necessarily then these various clusters whites must have heard great river far west indeed they did hear it vaguely so vaguely indefinitely that its course proportions locality were hardly even guessable mere mysteriousness matter ought have fired curiosity compelled exploration but this did not occur apparently nobody happened want such river nobody needed it nobody was curious about it so for century half mississippi remained out market undisturbed when de soto found it he was not hunting for river had no present occasion for one consequently he did not value it or even take any particular notice it but at last la salle frenchman conceived idea seeking out that river exploring it it always happens that when man seizes upon neglected important idea people inflamed with same notion crop up all around it happened so this instance naturally question suggests itself why did these people want river now when nobody had wanted it five preceding generations apparently it was because at this late day they thought they had discovered way make it useful for it had come be believed that mississippi emptied into gulf california therefore afforded short cut from canada china previously supposition had been that it emptied into atlantic or sea virginia chapter 2 river its explorers la salle himself sued for certain high privileges they were graciously accorded him by louis xiv inflated memory chief among them was privilege explore far wide build forts stake out continents hand same over king pay expenses himself receiving return some little advantages one sort or another among them monopoly buffalo hides he spent several years about all his money making perilous painful trips between montreal fort which he had built on illinois before he at last succeeded getting his expedition such shape that he could strike for mississippi meantime other parties had had better fortune 1673 joliet merchant marquette priest crossed country reached banks mississippi they went by way great lakes from green bay canoes by way fox river wisconsin marquette had solemnly contracted on feast immaculate conception that if virgin would permit him discover great river he would name it conception her honor he kept his word that day all explorers traveled with outfit priests de soto had twenty four with him la salle had several also expeditions were often out meat scant clothes but they always had furniture other requisites for mass they were always prepared as one quaint chroniclers time phrased it explain hell savages on 17th june 1673 canoes joliet marquette their five subordinates reached junction wisconsin with mississippi mr parkman says before them wide rapid current coursed athwart their way by foot lofty heights wrapped thick forests he continues turning southward they paddled down stream through solitude unrelieved by faintest trace man big cat fish collided with marquette s canoe startled him reasonably enough for he had been warned by indians that he was on foolhardy journey even fatal one for river contained demon whose roar could be heard at great distance who would engulf them abyss where he dwelt i have seen mississippi cat fish that was more than six feet long weighed two hundred fifty pounds if marquette s fish was fellow that one he had fair right think river s roaring demon was come at length buffalo began appear grazing herds on great prairies which then bordered river marquette describes fierce stupid look old bulls as they stared at intruders through tangled mane which nearly blinded them voyagers moved cautiously landed at night made fire cook their evening meal then extinguished it embarked again paddled some way farther anchored stream keeping man on watch till morning they did this day after day night after night at end two weeks they had not seen human being river was awful solitude then it is now over most its stretch but at close fortnight they one day came upon footprints men mud western bank robinson crusoe experience which carries electric shiver with it yet when one stumbles on it print they had been warned that river indians were as ferocious pitiless as river demon destroyed all comers without waiting for provocation but no matter joliet marquette struck into country hunt up proprietors tracks they found them by by were hospitably received well treated if be received by indian chief who has taken off his last rag order appear at his level best is be received hospitably if be treated abundantly fish porridge other game including dog have these things forked into one s mouth by ungloved fingers indians is be well treated morning chief six hundred his tribesmen escorted frenchmen river bade them friendly farewell on rocks above present city alton they found some rude fantastic indian paintings which they describe short distance below torrent yellow mud rushed furiously athwart calm blue current mississippi boiling surging sweeping its course logs branches uprooted trees this was mouth missouri that savage river which descending from its mad career through vast unknown barbarism poured its turbid floods into bosom its gentle sister by by they passed mouth ohio they passed cane brakes they fought mosquitoes they floated along day after day through deep silence loneliness river drowsing scant shade makeshift awnings broiling with heat they encountered exchanged civilities with another party indians at last they reached mouth arkansas about month out from their starting point where tribe war whooping savages swarmed out meet murder them but they appealed virgin for help so place fight there was feast plenty pleasant palaver fol de rol they had proved their satisfaction that mississippi did not empty into gulf california or into atlantic they believed it emptied into gulf mexico they turned back now carried their great news canada but belief is not proof it was reserved for la salle furnish proof he was provokingly delayed by one misfortune after another but at last got his expedition under way at end year 1681 dead winter he henri de tonty son lorenzo tonty who invented tontine his lieutenant started down illinois with following eighteen indians brought from new england twenty three frenchmen they moved procession down surface frozen river on foot dragging their canoes after them on sledges at peoria lake they struck open water paddled thence mississippi turned their prows southward they plowed through fields floating ice past mouth missouri past mouth ohio by by gliding by wastes bordering swamp landed on 24th february near third chickasaw bluffs where they halted built fort prudhomme again says mr parkman they embarked with every stage their adventurous progress mystery this vast new world was more more unveiled more more they entered realms spring hazy sunlight warm drowsy air tender foliage opening flowers betokened reviving life nature day by day they floated down great bends shadow dense forests time arrived at mouth arkansas first they were greeted by natives this locality as marquette had before been greeted by them with booming war drum flourish arms virgin composed difficulty marquette s case pipe peace did same office for la salle white man red man struck hands entertained each other during three days then admiration savages la salle set up cross with arms france on it took possession whole country for king cool fashion time while priest piously consecrated robbery with hymn priest explained mysteries faith by signs for saving savages thus compensating them with possible possessions heaven for certain ones on earth which they had just been robbed also by signs la salle drew from these simple children forest acknowledgments fealty louis putrid over water nobody smiled at these colossal ironies these performances took place on site future town napoleon arkansas there first confiscation cross was raised on banks great river marquette s joliet s voyage discovery ended at same spot site future town napoleon when de soto took his fleeting glimpse river away back dim early days he took it from that same spot site future town napoleon arkansas therefore three out four memorable events connected with discovery exploration mighty river occurred by accident one same place it is most curious distinction when one comes look at it think about it france stole that vast country on that spot future napoleon by by napoleon himself was give country back again make restitution not owners but their white american heirs voyagers journeyed on touching here there passed sites since become historic vicksburg grand gulf visited imposing indian monarch teche country whose capital city was substantial one sun baked bricks mixed with straw better houses than many that exist there now chiefs house contained audience room forty feet square there he received tonty state surrounded by sixty old men clothed white cloaks there was temple town with mud wall about it ornamented with skulls enemies sacrificed sun voyagers visited natchez indians near site present city that name where they found religious political despotism privileged class descended from sun temple sacred fire it must have been like getting home again it was home with advantage fact for it lacked louis xiv few more days swept swiftly by la salle stood shadow his confiscating cross at meeting waters from delaware from itaska from mountain ranges close upon pacific with waters gulf mexico his task finished his prodigy achieved mr parkman closing his fascinating narrative thus sums up on that day realm france received on parchment stupendous accession fertile plains texas vast basin mississippi from its frozen northern springs sultry borders gulf from woody ridges alleghanies bare peaks rocky mountains region savannas forests sun cracked deserts grassy prairies watered by thousand rivers ranged by thousand warlike tribes passed beneath scepter sultan versailles all by virtue feeble human voice inaudible at half mile chapter 3 frescoes from past apparently river was ready for business now but no distribution population along its banks was as calm deliberate time devouring process as discovery exploration had been seventy years elapsed after exploration before river s borders had white population worth considering nearly fifty more before river had commerce between la salle s opening river time when it may be said have become vehicle anything like regular active commerce seven sovereigns had occupied throne england america had become independent nation louis xiv louis xv had rotted died french monarchy had gone down red tempest revolution napoleon was name that was beginning be talked about truly there were snails those days river s earliest commerce was great barges keelboats broadhorns they floated sailed from upper rivers new orleans changed cargoes there were tediously warped poled back by hand voyage down back sometimes occupied nine months time this commerce increased until it gave employment hordes rough hardy men rude uneducated brave suffering terrific hardships with sailor like stoicism heavy drinkers coarse frolickers moral sties like natchez under hill that day heavy fighters reckless fellows every one elephantinely jolly foul witted profane prodigal their money bankrupt at end trip fond barbaric finery prodigious braggarts yet main honest trustworthy faithful promises duty often picturesquely magnanimous by by steamboat intruded then for fifteen or twenty years these men continued run their keelboats down stream steamers did all upstream business keelboatmen selling their boats new orleans returning home as deck passengers steamers but after while steamboats so increased number speed that they were

keelboatman which i desire offer this place i now come phase mississippi river life flush times steamboating which seems me warrant full examination marvelous science piloting as displayed there i believe there has been nothing like it elsewhere world chapter 4 boys ambition when i was boy there was but one permanent ambition among my comrades our village footnote 1 hannibal missouri on west bank mississippi river that was be steamboatman we had transient ambitions other sorts but they were only transient when circus came went it left us all burning become clowns first negro minstrel show that came our section left us all suffering try that kind life now then we had hope that if we lived were good god would permit us be pirates these ambitions faded out each its turn but ambition be steamboatman always remained once day cheap gaudy packet arrived upward from st louis another downward from keokuk before these events day was glorious with expectancy after them day was dead empty thing not only boys but whole village felt this after all these years i can picture that old time myself now just as it was then white town drowsing sunshine summer s morning streets empty or pretty nearly so one or two clerks sitting front water street stores with their splint bottomed chairs tilted back against wall chins on breasts hats slouched over their faces asleep with shingle shavings enough around show what broke them down sow litter pigs loafing along sidewalk doing good business watermelon rinds seeds two or three lonely little freight piles scattered about levee pile skids on slope stone paved wharf fragrant town drunkard asleep shadow them two or three wood flats at head wharf but nobody listen peaceful lapping wavelets against them great mississippi majestic magnificent mississippi rolling its mile wide tide along shining sun dense forest away on other side point above town point below bounding river glimpse turning it into sort sea withal very still brilliant lonely one presently film dark smoke appears above one those remote points instantly negro drayman famous for his quick eye prodigious voice lifts up cry s t e m boat comin scene changes town drunkard stirs clerks wake up furious clatter drays follows every house store pours out human contribution all twinkling dead town is alive moving drays carts men boys all go hurrying from many quarters common center wharf assembled there people fasten their eyes upon coming boat as upon wonder they are seeing for first time boat is rather handsome sight too she is long sharp trim pretty she has two tall fancy topped chimneys with gilded device some kind swung between them fanciful pilot house glass gingerbread perched on top texas deck behind them paddle boxes are gorgeous with picture or with gilded rays above boat s name boiler deck hurricane deck texas deck are fenced ornamented with clean white railings there is flag gallantly flying from jack staff furnace doors are open fires glaring bravely upper decks are black with passengers captain stands by big bell calm imposing envy all great volumes blackest smoke are rolling tumbling out chimneys husbanded grandeur created with bit pitch pine just before arriving at town crew are grouped on forecastle broad stage is run far out over port bow envied deckhand stands picturesquely on end it with coil rope his hand pent steam is screaming through gauge cocks captain lifts his hand bell rings wheels stop then they turn back churning water foam steamer is at rest then such scramble as there is get aboard get ashore take freight discharge freight all at one same time such yelling cursing as mates facilitate it all with ten minutes later steamer is under way again with no flag on jack staff no black smoke issuing from chimneys after ten more minutes town is dead again town drunkard asleep by skids once more my father was justice peace i supposed he possessed power life death over all men could hang anybody that offended him this was distinction enough for me as general thing but desire be steamboatman kept intruding nevertheless i first wanted be cabin boy so that i could come out with white apron on shake tablecloth over side where all my old comrades could see me later i thought i would rather be deckhand who stood on end stage plank with coil rope his hand because he was particularly conspicuous but these were only day dreams they were too heavenly be contemplated as real possibilities by by one our boys went away he was not heard for long time at last he turned up as apprentice engineer or striker on steamboat this thing shook bottom out all my sunday school teachings that boy had been notoriously worldly i just reverse yet he was exalted this eminence i left obscurity misery there was nothing generous about this fellow his greatness he would always manage have rusty bolt scrub while his boat tarried at our town he would sit on inside guard scrub it where we could all see him envy him loathe him whenever his boat was laid up he would come home swell around town his blackest greasiest clothes so that nobody could help remembering that he was steamboatman he used all sorts steamboat technicalities his talk as if he were so used them that he forgot common people could not understand them he would speak labboard side horse easy natural way that would make one wish he was dead he was always talking about st looy like old citizen he would refer casually occasions when he was coming down fourth street or when he was passing by planter s house or when there was fire he took turn on brakes old big missouri then he would go on lie about how many towns size ours were burned down there that day two or three boys had long been persons consideration among us because they had been st louis once had vague general knowledge its wonders but day their glory was over now they lapsed into humble silence learned disappear when ruthless cub engineer approached this fellow had money too hair oil also ignorant silver watch showy brass watch chain he wore leather belt used no suspenders if ever youth was cordially admired hated by his comrades this one was no girl could withstand his charms he cut out every boy village when his boat blew up at last it diffused tranquil contentment among us such as we had not known for months but when he came home next week alive renowned appeared church all battered up bandaged shining hero stared at wondered over by everybody it seemed us that partiality providence for undeserving reptile had reached point where it was open criticism this creature s career could produce but one result it speedily followed boy after boy managed get on river minister s son became engineer doctor s post master s sons became mud clerks wholesale liquor dealer s son became barkeeper on boat four sons chief merchant two sons county judge became pilots pilot was grandest position all pilot even those days trivial wages had princely salary from hundred fifty two hundred fifty dollars month no board pay two months his wages would pay preacher s salary for year now some us were left disconsolate we could not get on river at least our parents would not let us so by by i ran away i said i never would come home again till i was pilot could come glory but somehow i could not manage it i went meekly aboard few boats that lay packed together like sardines at long st louis wharf very humbly inquired for pilots but got only cold shoulder short words from mates clerks i had make best this sort treatment for time being but i had comforting daydreams future when i should be great honored pilot with plenty money could kill some these mates clerks pay for them chapter 5 i want be cub pilot months afterward hope within me struggled reluctant death i found myself without ambition but i was ashamed go home i was cincinnati i set work map out new career i had been reading about recent exploration river amazon by expedition sent out by our government it was said that expedition owing difficulties had not thoroughly explored part country lying about head waters some four thousand miles from mouth river it was only about fifteen hundred miles from cincinnati new orleans where i could doubtless get ship i had thirty dollars left i would go complete exploration amazon this was all thought i gave subject i never was great matters detail i packed my valise took passage on ancient tub called paul jones for new orleans for sum sixteen dollars i had scarred tarnished splendors her main saloon principally myself for she was not creature attract eye wiser travelers when we presently got under way went poking down broad ohio i became new being subject my own admiration i was traveler word never had tasted so good my mouth before i had exultant sense being bound for mysterious lands distant climes which i never have felt so uplifting degree since i was such glorified condition that all ignoble feelings departed out me i was able look down pity untraveled with compassion that had hardly trace contempt it still when we stopped at villages wood yards i could not help lolling carelessly upon railings boiler deck enjoy envy country boys on bank if they did not seem discover me i presently sneezed attract their attention or moved position where they could not help seeing me as soon as i knew they saw me i gaped stretched gave other signs being mightily bored with traveling i kept my hat off all time stayed where wind sun could strike me because i wanted get bronzed weather beaten look old traveler before second day was half gone i experienced joy which filled me with purest gratitude for i saw that skin had begun blister peel off my face neck i wished that boys girls at home could see me now we reached louisville time at least neighborhood it we stuck hard fast on rocks middle river lay there four days i was now beginning feel strong sense being part boat s family sort infant son captain younger brother officers there is no estimating pride i took this grandeur or affection that began swell grow me for those people i could not know how lordly steamboatman scorns that sort presumption mere landsman i particularly longed acquire least trifle notice from big stormy mate i was on alert for opportunity do him service that end it came at last riotous powwow setting spar was going on down on forecastle i went down there stood around way or mostly skipping out it till mate suddenly roared general order for somebody bring him capstan bar i sprang his side said tell me where it is i ll fetch it if rag picker had offered do diplomatic service for emperor russia monarch could not have been more astounded than mate was he even stopped swearing he stood stared down at me it took him ten seconds scrape his disjointed remains together again then he said impressively well if this don t beat hell turned his work with air man who had been confronted with problem too abstruse for solution i crept away courted solitude for rest day i did not go dinner i stayed away from supper until everybody else had finished i did not feel so much like member boat s family now as before however my spirits returned installments as we pursued our way down river i was sorry i hated mate so because it was not young human nature not admire him he was huge muscular his face was bearded whiskered all over he had red woman blue woman tattooed on his right arm one on each side blue anchor with red rope it matter profanity he was sublime when he was getting out cargo at landing i was always where i could see hear he felt all majesty his great position made world feel it too when he gave even simplest order he discharged it like blast lightning sent long reverberating peal profanity thundering after it i could not help contrasting way which average landsman would give order with mate s way doing it if landsman should wish gang plank moved foot farther forward he would probably say james or william one you push that plank forward please but put mate his place he would roar out here now start that gang plank for ard lively now what re you about snatch it snatch it there there aft again aft again don t you hear me dash it dash are you going sleep over it vast heaving vast heaving i tell you going heave it clear astern where re you going with that barrel for ard with it fore i make you swallow it you dash dash dash dashed split between tired mud turtle crippled hearse horse i wished i could talk like that when soreness my adventure with mate had somewhat worn off i began timidly make up humblest official connected with boat night watchman he snubbed my advances at first but i presently ventured offer him new chalk pipe that softened him so he allowed me sit with him by big bell on hurricane deck time he melted into conversation he could not well have helped it i hung with such homage on his words so plainly showed that i felt honored by his notice he told me names dim capes shadowy islands as we glided by them solemnity night under winking stars by by got talking about himself he seemed over sentimental for man whose salary was six dollars week or rather he might have seemed so older person than i but i drank his words hungrily with faith that might have moved mountains if it had been applied judiciously what was it me that he was soiled seedy fragrant with gin what was it me that his grammar was bad his construction worse his profanity so void art that it was element weakness rather than strength his conversation he was wronged man man who had seen trouble that was enough for me as he mellowed into his plaintive history his tears dripped upon lantern his lap i cried too from sympathy he said he was son english nobleman either earl or alderman he could not remember which but believed was both his father nobleman loved him but his mother hated him from cradle so while he was still little boy he was sent one them old ancient colleges he couldn t remember which by by his father died his mother seized property shook him as he phrased it after his mother shook him members nobility with whom he was acquainted used their influence get him position loblolly boy ship from that point my watchman threw off all trammels date locality branched out into narrative that bristled all along with incredible adventures narrative that was so reeking with bloodshed so crammed with hair breadth escapes most engaging unconscious personal villainies that i sat speechless enjoying shuddering wondering worshipping it was sore blight find out afterwards that he was low vulgar ignorant sentimental half witted humbug untraveled native wilds illinois who had absorbed wildcat literature appropriated its marvels until time he had woven odds ends mess into this yarn then gone on telling it fledglings like me until he had come believe it himself chapter 6 cub pilot s experience what with lying on rocks four days at louisville some other delays poor old paul jones fooled away about two weeks making voyage from cincinnati new orleans this gave me chance get acquainted with one pilots he taught me how steer boat thus made fascination river life more potent than ever for me it also gave me chance get acquainted with youth who had taken deck passage more s pity for he easily borrowed six dollars me on promise return boat pay it back me day after we should arrive but he probably died or forgot for he never came it was doubtless former since he had said his parents were wealthy he only traveled deck passage because it was cooler footnote 1 deck passage i e steerage passage i soon discovered two things one was that vessel would not be likely sail for mouth amazon under ten or twelve years other was that nine or ten dollars still left my pocket would not suffice for so imposing exploration as i had planned even if i could afford wait for ship therefore it followed that i must contrive new career paul jones was now bound for st louis i planned siege against my pilot at end three hard days he surrendered he agreed teach me mississippi river from new orleans st louis for five hundred dollars payable out first wages i should receive after graduating i entered upon small enterprise learning twelve or thirteen hundred miles great mississippi river with easy confidence my time life if i had really known what i was about require my faculties i should not have had courage begin i supposed that all pilot had do was keep his boat river i did not consider that that could be much trick since it was so wide boat backed out from new orleans at four afternoon it was our watch until eight mr bixby my chief straightened her up plowed her along past sterns other boats that lay at levee then said here take her shave those steamships as close as you d peel apple i took wheel my heart beat fluttered up into hundreds for it seemed me that we were about scrape side off every ship line we were so close i held my breath began claw boat away from danger i had my own opinion pilot who had known no better than get us into such peril but i was too wise express it half minute i had wide margin safety intervening between paul jones ships within ten seconds more i was set aside disgrace mr bixby was going into danger again flaying me alive with abuse my cowardice i was stung but i was obliged admire easy confidence with which my chief loafed from side side his wheel trimmed ships so closely that disaster seemed ceaselessly imminent when he had cooled little he told me that easy water was close ashore current outside therefore we must hug bank up stream get benefit former stay well out down stream take advantage latter my own mind i resolved be down stream pilot leave up streaming people dead prudence now then mr bixby called my attention certain things said he this is six mile point i assented it was pleasant enough information but i could not see bearing it i was not conscious that it was matter any interest me another time he said this is nine mile point later he said this is twelve mile point they were all about level with water s edge they all looked about alike me they were monotonously unpicturesque i hoped mr bixby would change subject but no he would crowd up around point hugging shore with affection then say slack water ends here abreast this bunch china trees now we cross over so he crossed over he gave me wheel once or twice but i had no luck i either came near chipping off edge sugar plantation or i yawed too far from shore so dropped back into disgrace again got abused watch was ended at last we took supper went bed at midnight glare lantern shone my eyes night watchman said come turn out then he left i could not understand this extraordinary procedure so i presently gave up trying dozed off sleep pretty soon watchman was back again this time he was gruff i was annoyed i said what do you want come bothering around here middle night for now as like as not i ll not get sleep again night watchman said well if this t good i m blest off watch was just turning i heard some brutal laughter from them such remarks as hello watchman t new cub turned out yet he s delicate likely give him some sugar rag send for chambermaid sing rock by baby him about this time mr bixby appeared on scene something like minute later i was climbing pilot house steps with some my clothes on rest my arms mr bixby was close behind commenting here was something fresh this thing getting up middle night go work it was detail piloting that had never occurred me at all i knew that boats ran all night but somehow i had never happened reflect that somebody had get up out warm bed run them i began fear that piloting was not quite so romantic as i had imagined it was there was something very real work like about this new phase it it was rather dingy night although fair number stars were out big mate was at wheel he had old tub pointed at star was holding her straight up middle river shores on either hand were not much more than half mile apart but they seemed wonderfully far away ever so vague indistinct mate said we ve got land at jones s plantation sir vengeful spirit me exulted i said myself i wish you joy your job mr bixby you ll have good time finding mr jones s plantation such night as this i hope you never will find it as long as you live mr bixby said mate upper end plantation or lower upper i can t do it stumps there are out water at this stage it s no great distance lower you ll have get along with that all right sir if jones don t like it he ll have lump it i reckon then mate left my exultation began cool my wonder come up here was man who not only proposed find this plantation on such night but find either end it you preferred i dreadfully wanted ask question but i was carrying about as many short answers as my cargo room would admit so i held my peace all i desired ask mr bixby was simple question whether he was ass enough really imagine he was going find that plantation on night when all plantations were exactly alike all same color but i held i used have fine inspirations prudence those days mr bixby made for shore soon was scraping it just same as if it had been daylight not only that but singing father heaven day is declining etc it seemed me that i had put my life keeping peculiarly reckless outcast presently he turned on me said what s name first point above new orleans i was gratified be able answer promptly i did i said i didn t know don t know this manner jolted me i was down at foot again moment but i had say just what i had said before well you re smart one said mr bixby what s name next point once more i didn t know well this beats anything tell me name any point or place i told you i studied while decided that i couldn t look here what do you start out from above twelve mile point cross over i i don t know you you don t know mimicking my drawling manner speech what do you know i i nothing for certain by great caesar s ghost i believe you you re stupidest dunderhead i ever saw or ever heard so help me moses idea you being pilot you why you don t know enough pilot cow down lane oh but his wrath was up he was nervous man he shuffled from one side his wheel other as if floor was hot he would boil while himself then overflow scald me again look here what do you suppose i told you names those points for i tremblingly considered moment then devil temptation provoked me say well be entertaining i thought this was red rag bull he raged stormed so he was crossing river at time that i judge it made him blind because he ran over steering oar trading scow course traders sent up volley red hot profanity never was man so grateful as mr bixby was because he was brim full here were subjects who would talk back he threw open window thrust his head out such irruption followed as i never had heard before fainter farther away scowmen s curses drifted higher mr bixby lifted his voice weightier his adjectives grew when he closed window he was empty you could have drawn seine through his system not caught curses enough disturb your mother with presently he said me gentlest way my boy you must get little memorandum book every time i tell you thing put it down right away there s only one way be pilot that is get this entire river by heart you have know it just like b c that was dismal revelation me for my memory was never loaded with anything but blank cartridges however i did not feel discouraged long i judged that it was best make some allowances for doubtless mr bixby was stretching presently he pulled rope struck few strokes on big bell stars were all gone now night was as black as ink i could hear wheels churn along bank but i was not entirely certain that i could see shore voice invisible watchman called up from hurricane deck what s this sir jones s plantation i said myself i wish i might venture offer small bet that it isn t but i did not chirp i only waited see mr bixby handled engine bells due time boat s nose came land torch glowed from forecastle man skipped ashore darky s voice on bank said gimme de k yarpet bag mars jones next moment we were standing up river again all serene i reflected deeply awhile then said but not aloud well finding that plantation was luckiest accident that ever happened but it couldn t happen again hundred years i fully believed it was accident too by time we had gone seven or eight hundred miles up river i had learned be tolerably plucky up stream steersman daylight before we reached st louis i had made trifle progress night work but only trifle i had note book that fairly bristled with names towns points bars islands bends reaches etc but information was be found only notebook none it was my head it made my heart ache think i had only got half river set down for as our watch was four hours off four hours on day night there was long four hour gap my book for every time i had slept since voyage began my chief was presently hired go on big new orleans boat i packed my satchel went with him she was grand affair when i stood her pilot house i was so far above water that i seemed perched on mountain her decks stretched so far away fore aft below me that i wondered how i could ever have considered little paul jones large craft there were other differences too paul jones s pilot house was cheap dingy battered rattle trap cramped for room but here was sumptuous glass temple room enough have dance showy red gold window curtains imposing sofa leather cushions back high bench where visiting pilots sit spin yarns look at river bright fanciful cuspadores instead broad wooden box filled with sawdust nice new oil cloth on floor hospitable big stove for winter wheel as high as my head costly with inlaid work wire tiller rope bright brass knobs for bells tidy white aproned black texas tender bring up tarts ices coffee during mid watch day night now this was something like so i began take heart once more believe that piloting was romantic sort occupation after all moment we were under way i began prowl about great steamer fill myself with joy she was as clean as dainty as drawing room when i looked down her long gilded saloon it was like gazing through splendid tunnel she had oil picture by some gifted sign painter on every stateroom door she glittered with no end prism fringed chandeliers clerk s office was elegant bar was marvelous bar keeper had been barbered upholstered at incredible cost boiler deck i e second story boat so speak was as spacious as church it seemed me so with forecastle there was no pitiful handful deckhands firemen roustabouts down there but whole battalion men fires were fiercely glaring from long row furnaces over them were eight huge boilers this was unutterable pomp mighty engines but enough this i had never felt so fine before when i found that regiment natty servants respectfully sir d me my satisfaction was complete chapter 7 daring deed when i returned pilot house st louis was gone i was lost here was piece river which was all down my book but i could make neither head nor tail it you understand it was turned around i had seen it when coming up stream but i had never faced about see how it looked when it was behind me my heart broke again for it was plain that i had got learn this troublesome river both ways pilot house was full pilots going down look at river what is called upper river two hundred miles between st louis cairo where ohio comes was low mississippi changes its channel so constantly that pilots used always find it necessary run down cairo take fresh look when their boats were lie port week that is when water was at low stage deal this looking at river was done by poor fellows who seldom had berth whose only hope getting one lay their being always freshly posted therefore ready drop into shoes some reputable pilot for single trip on account such pilot s sudden illness or some other necessity good many them constantly ran up down inspecting river not because they ever really hoped get berth but because they being guests boat it was cheaper look at river than stay ashore pay board time these fellows grew dainty their tastes only infested boats that had established reputation for setting good tables all visiting pilots were useful for they were always ready willing winter or summer night or day go out yawl help buoy channel or assist boat s pilots any way they could they were likewise welcome because all pilots are tireless talkers when gathered together as they talk only about river they are always understood are always interesting your true pilot cares nothing about anything on earth but river his pride his occupation surpasses pride kings we had fine company these river inspectors along this trip there were eight or ten there was abundance room for them our great pilot house two or three them wore polished silk hats elaborate shirt fronts diamond breast pins kid gloves patent leather boots they were choice their english bore themselves with dignity proper men solid means prodigious reputation as pilots others were more or less loosely clad wore upon their heads tall felt cones that were suggestive days commonwealth i was cipher this august company felt subdued not say torpid i was not even sufficient consequence assist at wheel when it was necessary put tiller hard down hurry guest that stood nearest did that when occasion required this was pretty much all time because crookedness channel scant water i stood corner talk i listened took hope all out me one visitor said another jim how did you run plum point coming up it was night there i ran it way one boys on diana told me started out about fifty yards above wood pile on false point held on cabin under plum point till i raised reef quarter less twain then straightened up for middle bar till i got well abreast old one limbed cotton wood bend then got my stern on cotton wood head on low place above point came through booming nine half pretty square crossing t it yes but upper bar s working down fast another pilot spoke up said i had better water than that ran it lower down started out from false point mark twain raised second reef abreast big snag bend had quarter less twain one gorgeous ones remarked i don t want find fault with your leadsmen but that s good deal water for plum point it seems me there was approving nod all around as this quiet snub dropped on boaster settled him so they went on talk talk talking meantime thing that was running my mind was now if my ears hear aright i have not only get names all towns islands bends so on by heart but i must even get up warm personal acquaintanceship with every old snag one limbed cotton wood obscure wood pile that ornaments banks this river for twelve hundred miles more than that i must actually know where these things are dark unless these guests are gifted with eyes that can pierce through two miles solid blackness i wish piloting business was jericho i had never thought it at dusk mr bixby tapped big bell three times signal land captain emerged from his drawing room forward end texas looked up inquiringly mr bixby said we will lay up here all night captain very well sir that was all boat came shore was tied up for night it seemed me fine thing that pilot could do as he pleased without asking so grand captain s permission i took my supper went immediately bed discouraged by my day s observations experiences my late voyage s note booking was but confusion meaningless names it had tangled me all up knot every time i had looked at it daytime i now hoped for respite sleep but no it reveled all through my head till sunrise again frantic tireless nightmare next morning i felt pretty rusty low spirited we went booming along taking good many chances for we were anxious get out river as getting out cairo was called before night should overtake us but mr bixby s partner other pilot presently grounded boat we lost so much time getting her off that it was plain that darkness would overtake us good long way above mouth this was great misfortune especially certain our visiting pilots whose boats would have wait for their return no matter how long that might be it sobered pilot house talk good deal coming up stream pilots did not mind low water or any kind darkness nothing stopped them but fog but down stream work was different boat was too nearly helpless with stiff current pushing behind her so it was not customary run down stream at night low water there seemed be one small hope however if we could get through intricate dangerous hat island crossing before night we could venture rest for we would have plainer sailing better water but it would be insanity attempt hat island at night so there was deal looking at watches all rest day constant ciphering upon speed we were making hat island was eternal subject sometimes hope was high sometimes we were delayed bad crossing down it went again for hours all hands lay under burden this suppressed excitement it was even communicated me i got feeling so solicitous about hat island under such awful pressure responsibility that i wished i might have five minutes on shore draw good full relieving breath start over again we were standing no regular watches each our pilots ran such portions river as he had run when coming up stream because his greater familiarity with it but both remained pilot house constantly hour before sunset mr bixby took wheel mr w stepped aside for next thirty minutes every man held his watch his hand was restless silent uneasy at last somebody said with doomful sigh well yonder s hat island we can t make it all watches closed with snap everybody sighed muttered something about its being too bad too bad ah if we could only have got here half hour sooner place was thick with atmosphere disappointment some started go out but loitered hearing no bell tap land sun dipped behind horizon boat went on inquiring looks passed from one guest another one who had his hand on door knob had turned it waited then presently took away his hand let knob turn back again we bore steadily down bend more looks were exchanged nods surprised admiration but no words insensibly men drew together behind mr bixby as sky darkened one or two dim stars came out dead silence sense waiting became oppressive mr bixby pulled cord two deep mellow notes from big bell floated off on night then pause one more note was struck watchman s voice followed from hurricane deck labboard lead there stabboard lead cries leadsmen began rise out distance were gruffly repeated by word passers on hurricane deck m r k three m r k three quarter less three half twain quarter twain m r k twain quarter less mr bixby pulled two bell ropes was answered by faint jinglings far below engine room our speed slackened steam began whistle through gauge cocks cries leadsmen went on it is weird sound always night every pilot lot was watching now with fixed eyes talking under his breath nobody was calm easy but mr bixby he would put his wheel down stand on spoke as steamer swung into her me utterly invisible marks for we seemed be midst wide gloomy sea he would meet fasten her there out murmur half audible talk one caught coherent sentence now then such as there she s over first reef all right after pause another subdued voice her stern s coming down just exactly right by george now she s marks over she goes somebody else muttered oh it was done beautiful beautiful now engines were stopped altogether we drifted with current not that i could see boat drift for i could not stars being all gone by this time this drifting was dismalest work it held one s heart still presently i discovered blacker gloom than that which surrounded us it was head island we were closing right down upon it we entered its deeper shadow so imminent seemed peril that i was likely suffocate i had strongest impulse do something anything save vessel but still mr bixby stood by his wheel silent intent as cat all pilots stood shoulder shoulder at his back she ll not make it somebody whispered water grew shoaler shoaler by leadsman s cries till it was down eight half e i g h t feet e i g h t feet seven mr bixby said warningly through his speaking tube engineer stand by now aye aye sir seven half seven feet six we touched bottom instantly mr bixby set lot bells ringing shouted through tube now let her have it every ounce you ve got then his partner put her hard down snatch her snatch her boat rasped ground her way through sand hung upon apex disaster single tremendous instant then over she went such shout as went up at mr bixby s back never loosened roof pilot house before there was no more trouble after that mr bixby was hero that night it was some little time too before his exploit ceased be talked about by river men fully realize marvelous precision required laying great steamer her marks that murky waste water one should know that not only must she pick her intricate way through snags blind reefs then shave head island so closely as brush overhanging foliage with her stern but at one place she must pass almost within arm s reach sunken invisible wreck that would snatch hull timbers from under her if she should strike it destroy quarter million dollars worth steam boat cargo five minutes maybe hundred fifty human lives into bargain last remark i heard that night was compliment mr bixby uttered soliloquy with unction by one our guests he said by shadow death but he s lightning pilot chapter 8 perplexing lessons at end what seemed tedious while i had managed pack my head full islands towns bars points bends curiously inanimate mass lumber it was too however inasmuch as i could shut my eyes reel off good long string these names without leaving out more than ten miles river every fifty i began feel that i could take boat down new orleans if i could make her skip those little gaps but course my complacency could hardly get start enough lift my nose trifle into air before mr bixby would think something fetch it down again one day he turned on me suddenly with this settler what is shape walnut bend he might as well have asked me my grandmother s opinion protoplasm i reflected respectfully then said i didn t know it had any particular shape my gunpowdery chief went off with bang course then went on loading firing until he was out adjectives i had learned long ago that he only carried just so many rounds ammunition was sure subside into very placable even remorseful old smooth bore as soon as they were all gone that word old is merely affectionate he was not more than thirty four i waited by by he said my boy you ve got know shape river perfectly it is all there is left steer by on very dark night everything else is blotted out gone but mind you it hasn t same shape night that it has day time how on earth am i ever going learn it then how do you follow hall at home dark because you know shape it you can t see it do you mean say that i ve got know all million trifling variations shape banks this interminable river as well as i know shape front hall at home on my honor you ve got know them better than any man ever did know shapes halls his own house i wish i was dead now i don t want discourage you but well pile it on me i might as well have it now as another time you see this has got be learned there isn t any getting around it clear starlight night throws such heavy shadows that if you didn t know shape shore perfectly you would claw away from every bunch timber because you would take black shadow it for solid cape you see you would be getting scared death every fifteen minutes by watch you would be fifty yards from shore all time when you ought be within fifty feet it you can t see snag one those shadows but you know exactly where it is shape river tells you when you are coming it then there s your pitch dark night river is very different shape on pitch dark night from what it is on starlight night all shores seem be straight lines then mighty dim ones too you d run them for straight lines only you know better you boldly drive your boat right into what seems be solid straight wall you knowing very well that reality there is curve there that wall falls back makes way for you then there s your gray mist you take night when there s one these grisly drizzly gray mists then there isn t any particular shape shore gray mist would tangle head oldest man that ever lived well then different kinds moonlight change shape river different ways you see oh don t say any more please have i got learn shape river according all these five hundred thousand different ways if i tried carry all that cargo my head it would make me stoop shouldered no you only learn shape river you learn it with such absolute certainty that you can always steer by shape that s your head never mind one that s before your eyes very well i ll try it but after i have learned it can i depend on it will it keep same form not go fooling around before mr bixby could answer mr w came take watch he said bixby you ll have look out for president s island all that country clear away up above old hen chickens banks are caving shape shores changing like everything why you wouldn t know point above 40 you can go up inside old sycamore snag now footnote 1 it may not be necessary but still it can do no harm explain that inside means between snag shore m t so that question was answered here were leagues shore changing shape my spirits were down mud again two things seemed pretty apparent me one was that order be pilot man had got learn more than any one man ought be allowed know other was that he must learn it all over again different way every twenty four hours that night we had watch until twelve now it was ancient river custom for two pilots chat bit when watch changed while relieving pilot put on his gloves lit his cigar his partner retiring pilot would say something like this i judge upper bar is making down little at hale s point had quarter twain with lower lead mark twain footnote two fathoms quarter twain is two quarter fathoms thirteen half feet mark three is three fathoms with other yes i thought it was making down little last trip meet any boats met one abreast head 21 but she was away over hugging bar i couldn t make her out entirely i took her for sunny south hadn t any skylights forward chimneys so on as relieving pilot took wheel his partner footnote partner is technical term for other pilot would mention that we were such such bend say we were abreast such such man s wood yard or plantation this was courtesy i supposed it was necessity but mr w came on watch full twelve minutes late on this particular night tremendous breach etiquette fact it is unpardonable sin among pilots so mr bixby gave him no greeting whatever but simply surrendered wheel marched out pilot house without word i was appalled it was villainous night for blackness we were particularly wide blind part river where there was no shape or substance anything it seemed incredible that mr bixby should have left that poor fellow kill boat trying find out where he was but i resolved that i would stand by him any way he should find that he was not wholly friendless so i stood around waited be asked where we were but mr w plunged on serenely through solid firmament black cats that stood for atmosphere never opened his mouth here is proud devil thought i here is limb satan that would rather send us all destruction than put himself under obligations me because i am not yet one salt earth privileged snub captains lord it over everything dead alive steamboat i presently climbed up on bench i did not think it was safe go sleep while this lunatic was on watch however i must have gone sleep course time because next thing i was aware was fact that day was breaking mr w gone mr bixby at wheel again so it was four o clock all well but me i felt like skinful dry bones all them trying ache at once mr bixby asked me what i had stayed up there for i confessed that it was do mr w benevolence tell him where he was it took five minutes for entire preposterousness thing filter into mr bixby s system then i judge it filled him nearly up chin because he paid me compliment not much one either he said well taking you by large you do seem be more different kinds ass than any creature i ever saw before what did you suppose he wanted know for i said i thought it might be convenience him convenience d nation didn t i tell you that man s got know river night same as he d know his own front hall well i can follow front hall dark if i know it is front hall but suppose you set me down middle it dark not tell me which hall it is how am i know well you ve got on river all right then i m glad i never said anything mr w i should say so why he d have slammed you through window utterly ruined hundred dollars worth window sash stuff i was glad this damage had been saved for it would have made me unpopular with owners they always hated anybody who had name being careless injuring things i went work now learn shape river all eluding ungraspable objects that ever i tried get mind or hands on that was chief i would fasten my eyes upon sharp wooded point that projected far into river some miles ahead me go laboriously photographing its shape upon my brain just as i was beginning succeed my satisfaction we would draw up toward it exasperating thing would begin melt away fold back into bank if there had been conspicuous dead tree standing upon very point cape i would find that tree inconspicuously merged into general forest occupying middle straight shore when i got abreast it no prominent hill would stick its shape long enough for me make up my mind what its form really was but it was as dissolving changeful as if it had been mountain butter hottest corner tropics nothing ever had same shape when i was coming downstream that it had borne when i went up i mentioned these little difficulties mr bixby he said that s very main virtue thing if shapes didn t change every three seconds they wouldn t be any use take this place where we are now for instance as long as that hill over yonder is only one hill i can boom right along way i m going but moment it splits at top forms v i know i ve got scratch starboard hurry or i ll bang this boat s brains out against rock then moment one prongs v swings behind other i ve got waltz larboard again or i ll have misunderstanding with snag that would snatch keelson out this steamboat as neatly as if it were sliver your hand if that hill didn t change its shape on bad nights there would be awful steamboat grave yard around here inside year it was plain that i had got learn shape river all different ways that could be thought upside down wrong end first inside out fore aft thortships then know what do on gray nights when it hadn t any shape at all so i set about it course time i began get best this knotty lesson my self complacency moved front once more mr bixby was all fixed ready start it rear again he opened on me after this fashion how much water did we have middle crossing at hole wall trip before last i considered this outrage i said every trip down up leadsmen are singing through that tangled place for three quarters hour on stretch how do you reckon i can remember such mess as that my boy you ve got remember it you ve got remember exact spot exact marks boat lay when we had shoalest water everyone five hundred shoal places between st louis new orleans you mustn t get shoal soundings marks one trip mixed up with shoal soundings marks another either for they re not often twice alike you must keep them separate when i came myself again i said when i get so that i can do that i ll be able raise dead then i won t have pilot steamboat make living i want retire from this business i want slush bucket brush i m only fit for roustabout i haven t got brains enough be pilot if i had i wouldn t have strength enough carry them around unless i went on crutches now drop that when i say i ll learn footnote teach is not river vocabulary man river i mean it you can depend on it i ll learn him or kill him chapter 9 continued perplexities there was no use arguing with person like this i promptly put such strain on my memory that by by even shoal water countless crossing marks began stay with me but result was just same i never could more than get one knotty thing learned before another presented itself now i had often seen pilots gazing at water pretending read it as if it were book but it was book that told me nothing time came at last however when mr bixby seemed think me far enough advanced bear lesson on water reading so he began do you see that long slanting line on face water now that s reef moreover it s bluff reef there is solid sand bar under it that is nearly as straight up down as side house there is plenty water close up it but mighty little on top it if you were hit it you would knock boat s brains out do you see where line fringes out at upper end begins fade away yes sir well that is low place that is head reef you can climb over there not hurt anything cross over now follow along close under reef easy water there not much current i followed reef along till i approached fringed end then mr bixby said now get ready wait till i give word she won t want mount reef boat hates shoal water stand by wait wait keep her well hand now cramp her down snatch her snatch her he seized other side wheel helped spin it around until it was hard down then we held it so boat resisted refused answer for while next she came surging starboard mounted reef sent long angry ridge water foaming away from her bows now watch her watch her like cat or she ll get away from you when she fights strong tiller slips little jerky greasy sort way let up on her trifle it is way she tells you at night that water is too shoal but keep edging her up little by little toward point you are well up on bar now there is bar under every point because water that comes down around it forms eddy allows sediment sink do you see those fine lines on face water that branch out like ribs fan well those are little reefs you want just miss ends them but run them pretty close now look out look out don t you crowd that slick greasy looking place there ain t nine feet there she won t stand it she begins smell it look sharp i tell you oh blazes there you go stop starboard wheel quick ship up back set her back engine bells jingled engines answered promptly shooting white columns steam far aloft out scape pipes but it was too late boat had smelt bar good earnest foamy ridges that radiated from her bows suddenly disappeared great dead swell came rolling forward swept ahead her she careened far over larboard went tearing away toward other shore as if she were about scared death we were good mile from where we ought have been when we finally got upper hand her again during afternoon watch next day mr bixby asked me if i knew how run next few miles i said go inside first snag above point outside next one start out from lower end higgins s wood yard make square crossing that s all right i ll be back before you close up on next point but he wasn t he was still below when i rounded it entered upon piece river which i had some misgivings about i did not know that he was hiding behind chimney see how i would perform i went gaily along getting prouder prouder for he had never left boat my sole charge such length time before i even got setting her letting wheel go entirely while i vaingloriously turned my back inspected stem marks hummed tune sort easy indifference which i had prodigiously admired bixby other great pilots once i inspected rather long when i faced front again my heart flew into my mouth so suddenly that if i hadn t clapped my teeth together i should have lost it one those frightful bluff reefs was stretching its deadly length right across our bows my head was gone moment i did not know which end i stood on i gasped could not get my breath i spun wheel down with such rapidity that it wove itself together like spider s web boat answered turned square away from reef but reef followed her i fled still it followed still it kept right across my bows i never looked see where i was going i only fled awful crash was imminent why didn t that villain come if i committed crime ringing bell i might get thrown overboard but better that than kill boat so blind desperation i started such rattling shivaree down below as never had astounded engineer this world before i fancy amidst frenzy bells engines began back fill furious way my reason forsook its throne we were about crash into woods on other side river just then mr bixby stepped calmly into view on hurricane deck my soul went out him gratitude my distress vanished i would have felt safe on brink niagara with mr bixby on hurricane deck he blandly sweetly took his tooth pick out his mouth between his fingers as if it were cigar we were just act climbing overhanging big tree passengers were scudding astern like rats lifted up these commands me ever so gently stop starboard stop larboard set her back on both boat hesitated halted pressed her nose among boughs critical instant then reluctantly began back away stop larboard come ahead on it stop starboard come ahead on it point her for bar i sailed away as serenely as summer s morning mr bixby came said with mock simplicity when you have hail my boy you ought tap big bell three times before you land so that engineers can get ready i blushed under sarcasm said i hadn t had any hail ah then it was for wood i suppose officer watch will tell you when he wants wood up i went on consuming said i wasn t after wood indeed why what could you want over here bend then did you ever know boat following bend up stream at this stage river no sir i wasn t trying follow it i was getting away from bluff reef no it wasn t bluff reef there isn t one within three miles where you were but i saw it it was as bluff as that one yonder just about run over it do you give it as order yes run over it if i don t i wish i may die all right i am taking responsibility i was just as anxious kill boat now as i had been save her before i impressed my orders upon my memory be used at inquest made straight break for reef as it disappeared under our bows i held my breath but we slid over it like oil now don t you see difference it wasn t anything but wind reef wind does that so i see but it is exactly like bluff reef how am i ever going tell them apart i can t tell you it is instinct by by you will just naturally know one from other but you never will be able explain why or how you know them apart it turned out be true face water time became wonderful book book that was dead language uneducated passenger but which told its mind me without reserve delivering its most cherished secrets as clearly as if it uttered them with voice it was not book be read once thrown aside for it had new story tell every day throughout long twelve hundred miles there was never page that was void interest never one that you could leave unread without loss never one that you would want skip thinking you could find higher enjoyment some other thing there never was so wonderful book written by man never one whose interest was so absorbing so unflagging so sparkingly renewed with every reperusal passenger who could not read it was charmed with peculiar sort faint dimple on its surface on rare occasions when he did not overlook it altogether but pilot that was italicized passage indeed it was more than that it was legend largest capitals with string shouting exclamation points at end it for it meant that wreck or rock was buried there that could tear life out strongest vessel that ever floated it is faintest simplest expression water ever makes most hideous pilot s eye truth passenger who could not read this book saw nothing but all manner pretty pictures it painted by sun shaded by clouds whereas trained eye these were not pictures at all but grimmest most dead earnest reading matter now when i had mastered language this water had come know every trifling feature that bordered great river as familiarly as i knew letters alphabet i had made valuable acquisition but i had lost something too i had lost something which could never be restored me while i lived all grace beauty poetry had gone out majestic river i still keep mind certain wonderful sunset which i witnessed when steamboating was new me broad expanse river was turned blood middle distance red hue brightened into gold through which solitary log came floating black conspicuous one place long slanting mark lay sparkling upon water another surface was broken by boiling tumbling rings that were as many tinted as opal where ruddy flush was faintest was smooth spot that was covered with graceful circles radiating lines ever so delicately traced shore on our left was densely wooded somber shadow that fell from this forest was broken one place by long ruffled trail that shone like silver high above forest wall clean stemmed dead tree waved single leafy bough that glowed like flame unobstructed splendor that was flowing from sun there were graceful curves reflected images woody heights soft distances over whole scene far near dissolving lights drifted steadily enriching it every passing moment with new marvels coloring i stood like one bewitched i drank it speechless rapture world was new me i had never seen anything like this at home but as i have said day came when i began cease from noting glories charms which moon sun twilight wrought upon river s face another day came when i ceased altogether note them then if that sunset scene had been repeated i should have looked upon it without rapture should have commented upon it inwardly after this fashion this sun means that we are going have wind morrow that floating log means that river is rising small thanks it that slanting mark on water refers bluff reef which is going kill somebody s steamboat one these nights if it keeps on stretching out like that those tumbling boils show dissolving bar changing channel there lines circles slick water over yonder are warning that that troublesome place is shoaling up dangerously that silver streak shadow forest is break from new snag he has located himself very best place he could have found fish for steamboats that tall dead tree with single living branch is not going last long then how is body ever going get through this blind place at night without friendly old landmark no romance beauty were all gone from river all value any feature it had for me now was amount usefulness it could furnish toward compassing safe piloting steamboat since those days i have pitied doctors from my heart what does lovely flush beauty s cheek mean doctor but break that ripples above some deadly disease are not all her visible charms sown thick with what are him signs symbols hidden decay does he ever see her beauty at all or doesn t he simply view her professionally comment upon her unwholesome condition all himself doesn t he sometimes wonder whether he has gained most or lost most by learning his trade chapter 10 completing my education whosoever has done me courtesy read my chapters which have preceded this may possibly wonder that i deal so minutely with piloting as science it was prime purpose those chapters i am not quite done yet i wish show most patient painstaking way what wonderful science it is ship channels are buoyed lighted therefore it is comparatively easy undertaking learn run them clear water rivers with gravel bottoms change their channels very gradually therefore one needs learn them but once but piloting becomes another matter when you apply it vast streams like mississippi missouri whose alluvial banks cave change constantly whose snags are always hunting up new quarters whose sandbars are never at rest whose channels are for ever dodging shirking whose obstructions must be confronted all nights all weathers without aid single light house or single buoy for there is neither light nor buoy be found anywhere all this three or four thousand miles villainous river footnote true at time referred not true now 1882 i feel justified enlarging upon this great science for reason that i feel sure no one has ever yet written paragraph about it who had piloted steamboat himself so had practical knowledge subject if theme were hackneyed i should be obliged deal gently with reader but since it is wholly new i have felt at liberty take up considerable degree room with it when i had learned name position every visible feature river when i had so mastered its shape that i could shut my eyes trace it from st louis new orleans when i had learned read face water as one would cull news from morning paper finally when i had trained my dull memory treasure up endless array soundings crossing marks keep fast hold them i judged that my education was complete so i got tilting my cap side my head wearing tooth pick my mouth at wheel mr bixby had his eye on these airs one day he said what is height that bank yonder at burgess s how can i tell sir it is three quarters mile away very poor eye very poor take glass i took glass presently said i can t tell i suppose that that bank is about foot half high foot half that s six foot bank how high was bank along here last trip i don t know i never noticed you didn t well you must always do it hereafter why because you ll have know good many things that it tells you for one thing it tells you stage river tells you whether there s more water or less river along here than there was last trip leads tell me that i rather thought i had advantage him there yes but suppose leads lie bank would tell you so then you d stir those leadsmen up bit there was ten foot bank here last trip there is only six foot bank now what does that signify that river is four feet higher than it was last trip very good is river rising or falling rising no it ain t i guess i am right sir yonder is some drift wood floating down stream rise starts drift wood but then it keeps on floating while after river is done rising now bank will tell you about this wait till you come place where it shelves little now here do you see this narrow belt fine sediment that was deposited while water was higher you see driftwood begins strand too bank helps other ways do you see that stump on false point ay ay sir well water is just up roots it you must make note that why because that means that there s seven feet chute 103 but 103 is long way up river yet that s where benefit bank comes there is water enough 103 now yet there may not be by time we get there but bank will keep us posted all along you don t run close chutes on falling river up stream there are precious few them that you are allowed run at all down stream there s law united states against it river may be rising by time we get 103 that case we ll run it we are drawing how much six feet aft six half forward well you do seem know something but what i particularly want know is if i have got keep up everlasting measuring banks this river twelve hundred miles month month out course my emotions were too deep for words for while presently i said how about these chutes are there many them i should say so i fancy we shan t run any river this trip as you ve ever seen it run before so speak if river begins rise again we ll go up behind bars that you ve always seen standing out river high dry like roof house we ll cut across low places that you ve never noticed at all right through middle bars that cover three hundred acres river we ll creep through cracks where you ve always thought was solid land we ll dart through woods leave twenty five miles river off one side we ll see hind side every island between new orleans cairo then i ve got go work learn just as much more river as i already know just about twice as much more as near as you can come at it well one lives find out i think i was fool when i went into this business yes that is true you are yet but you ll not be when you ve learned it ah i never can learn it i will see that you do by by i ventured again have i got learn all this thing just as i know rest river shapes all so i can run it at night yes you ve got have good fair marks from one end river other that will help bank tell you when there is water enough each these countless places like that stump you know when river first begins rise you can run half dozen deepest them when it rises foot more you can run another dozen next foot will add couple dozen so on so you see you have know your banks marks dead moral certainty never get them mixed for when you start through one those cracks there s no backing out again as there is big river you ve got go through or stay there six months if you get caught on falling river there are about fifty these cracks which you can t run at all except when river is brim full over banks this new lesson is cheerful prospect cheerful enough mind what i ve just told you when you start into one those places you ve got go through they are too narrow turn around too crooked back out shoal water is always up at head never elsewhere head them is always likely be filling up little by little so that marks you reckon their depth by this season may not answer for next learn new set then every year exactly cramp her up bar what are you standing up through middle river for next few months showed me strange things on same day that we held conversation above narrated we met great rise coming down river whole vast face stream was black with drifting dead logs broken boughs great trees that had caved been washed away it required nicest steering pick one s way through this rushing raft even day time when crossing from point point at night difficulty was mightily increased every now then huge log lying deep water would suddenly appear right under our bows coming head on no use try avoid it then we could only stop engines one wheel would walk over that log from one end other keeping up thundering racket careening boat way that was very uncomfortable passengers now then we would hit one these sunken logs rattling bang dead center with full head steam it would stun boat as if she had hit continent sometimes this log would lodge stay right across our nose back mississippi up before it we would have do little craw fishing then get away from obstruction we often hit white logs dark for we could not see them till we were right on them but black log is pretty distinct object at night white snag is ugly customer when daylight is gone course on great rise down came swarm prodigious timber rafts from head waters mississippi coal barges from pittsburgh little trading scows from everywhere broad horns from posey county indiana freighted with fruit furniture usual term for describing it though plain english freight thus aggrandized was hoop poles pumpkins pilots bore mortal hatred these craft it was returned with usury law required all such helpless traders keep light burning but it was law that was often broken all sudden on murky night light would hop up right under our bows almost agonized voice with backwoods whang it would wail out whar n you goin cain t you see nothin you dash dashed aig suckin sheep stealin one eyed son stuffed monkey then for instant as we whistled by red glare from our furnaces would reveal scow form gesticulating orator as if under lightning flash that instant our firemen deck hands would send receive tempest missiles profanity one our wheels would walk off with crashing fragments steering oar down dead blackness would shut again that flatboatman would be sure go into new orleans sue our boat swearing stoutly that he had light burning all time when truth his gang had lantern down below sing lie drink gamble by no watch on deck once at night one those forest bordered crevices behind island which steamboatmen intensely describe with phrase as dark as inside cow we should have eaten up posey county family fruit furniture all but that they happened be fiddling down below we just caught sound music time sheer off doing no serious damage unfortunately but coming so near it that we had good hopes for moment these people brought up their lantern then course as we backed filled get away precious family stood light it both sexes various ages cursed us till everything turned blue once coalboatman sent bullet through our pilot house when we borrowed steering oar him very narrow place chapter 11 river rises during this big rise these small fry craft were intolerable nuisance we were running chute after chute new world me if there was particularly cramped place chute we would be pretty sure meet broad horn there if he failed be there we would find him still worse locality namely head chute on shoal water then there would be no end profane cordialities exchanged sometimes big river when we would be feeling our way cautiously along through fog deep hush would suddenly be broken by yells clamor tin pans all instant log raft would appear vaguely through webby veil close upon us then we did not wait swap knives but snatched our engine bells out by roots piled on all steam we had scramble out way one doesn t hit rock or solid log craft with steamboat when he can get excused you will hardly believe it but many steamboat clerks always carried large assortment religious tracts with them those old departed steamboating days indeed they did twenty times day we would be cramping up around bar while string these small fry rascals were drifting down into head bend away above beyond us couple miles now skiff would dart away from one them come fighting its laborious way across desert water it would ease all shadow our forecastle panting oarsmen would shout gimme pa per as skiff drifted swiftly astern clerk would throw over file new orleans journals if these were picked up without comment you might notice that now dozen other skiffs had been drifting down upon us without saying anything you understand they had been waiting see how no 1 was going fare no 1 making no comment all rest would bend their oars come on now as fast as they came clerk would heave over neat bundles religious tracts tied shingles amount hard swearing which twelve packages religious literature will command when impartially divided up among twelve raftsmen s crews who have pulled heavy skiff two miles on hot day get them is simply incredible as i have said big rise brought new world under my vision by time river was over its banks we had forsaken our old paths were hourly climbing over bars that had stood ten feet out water before we were shaving stumpy shores like that at foot madrid bend which i had always seen avoided before we were clattering through chutes like that 82 where opening at foot was unbroken wall timber till our nose was almost at very spot some these chutes were utter solitudes dense untouched forest overhung both banks crooked little crack one could believe that human creatures had never intruded there before swinging grape vines grassy nooks vistas glimpsed as we swept by flowering creepers waving their red blossoms from tops dead trunks all spendthrift richness forest foliage were wasted thrown away there chutes were lovely places steer they were deep except at head current was gentle under points water was absolutely dead invisible banks so bluff that where tender willow thickets projected you could bury your boat s broadside them as you tore along then you seemed fairly fly behind other islands we found wretched little farms wretcheder little log cabins there were crazy rail fences sticking foot or two above water with one or two jeans clad chills racked yellow faced male miserables roosting on top rail elbows on knees jaws hands grinding tobacco discharging result at floating chips through crevices left by lost teeth while rest family few farm animals were huddled together empty wood flat riding at her moorings close at hand this flat boat family would have cook eat sleep for lesser or greater number days or possibly weeks until river should fall two or three feet let them get back their log cabin their chills again chills being merciful provision all wise providence enable them take exercise without exertion this sort watery camping out was thing which these people were rather liable be treated couple times year by december rise out ohio june rise out mississippi yet these were kindly dispensations for they at least enabled poor things rise from dead now then look upon life when steamboat went by they appreciated blessing too for they spread their mouths eyes wide open made most these occasions now what could these banished creatures find do keep from dying blues during low water season once one these lovely island chutes we found our course completely bridged by great fallen tree this will serve show how narrow some chutes were passengers had hour s recreation virgin wilderness while boat hands chopped bridge away for there was no such thing as turning back you comprehend from cairo baton rouge when river is over its banks you have no particular trouble night for thousand mile wall dense forest that guards two banks all way is only gapped with farm or wood yard opening at intervals so you can t get out river much easier than you could get out fenced lane but from baton rouge new orleans it is different matter river is more than mile wide very deep as much as two hundred feet places both banks for good deal over hundred miles are shorn their timber bordered by continuous sugar plantations with only here there scattering sapling or row ornamental china trees timber is shorn off clear rear plantations from two four miles when first frost threatens come planters snatch off their crops hurry when they have finished grinding cane they form refuse stalks which they call bagasse into great piles set fire them though other sugar countries bagasse is used for fuel furnaces sugar mills now piles damp bagasse burn slowly smoke like satan s own kitchen embankment ten or fifteen feet high guards both banks mississippi all way down that lower end river this embankment is set back from edge shore from ten perhaps hundred feet according circumstances say thirty or forty feet as general thing fill that whole region with impenetrable gloom smoke from hundred miles burning bagasse piles when river is over banks turn steamboat loose along there at midnight see how she will feel see how you will feel too you find yourself away out midst vague dim sea that is shoreless that fades out loses itself murky distances for you cannot discern thin rib embankment you are always imagining you see straggling tree when you don t plantations themselves are transformed by smoke look like part sea all through your watch you are tortured with exquisite misery uncertainty you hope you are keeping river but you do not know all that you are sure about is that you are likely be within six feet bank destruction when you think you are good half mile from shore you are sure also that if you chance suddenly fetch up against embankment topple your chimneys overboard you will have small comfort knowing that it is about what you were expecting do one great vicksburg packets darted out into sugar plantation one night at such time had stay there week but there was no novelty about it it had often been done before i thought i had finished this chapter but i wish add curious thing while it is my mind it is only relevant that it is connected with piloting there used be excellent pilot on river mr x who was somnambulist it was said that if his mind was troubled about bad piece river he was pretty sure get up walk his sleep do strange things he was once fellow pilot for trip or two with george ealer on great new orleans passenger packet during considerable part first trip george was uneasy but got over it by by as x seemed content stay his bed when asleep late one night boat was approaching helena arkansas water was low crossing above town very blind tangled condition x had seen crossing since ealer had as night was particularly drizzly sullen dark ealer was considering whether he had not better have x called assist running place when door opened x walked now on very dark nights light is deadly enemy piloting you are aware that if you stand lighted room on such night you cannot see things street any purpose but if you put out lights stand gloom you can make out objects street pretty well so on very dark nights pilots do not smoke they allow no fire pilot house stove if there is crack which can allow least ray escape they order furnaces be curtained with huge tarpaulins sky lights be closely blinded then no light whatever issues from boat undefinable shape that now entered pilot house had mr x s voice this said let me take her george i ve seen this place since you have it is so crooked that i reckon i can run it myself easier than i could tell you how do it it is kind you i swear i am willing i haven t got another drop perspiration left me i have been spinning around around wheel like squirrel it is so dark i can t tell which way she is swinging till she is coming around like whirligig so ealer took seat on bench panting breathless black phantom assumed wheel without saying anything steadied waltzing steamer with turn or two then stood at ease coaxing her little this side then that as gently as sweetly as if time had been noonday when ealer observed this marvel steering he wished he had not confessed he stared wondered finally said well i thought i knew how steer steamboat but that was another mistake mine x said nothing but went serenely on with his work he rang for leads he rang slow down steam he worked boat carefully neatly into invisible marks then stood at center wheel peered blandly out into blackness fore aft verify his position as leads shoaled more more he stopped engines entirely dead silence suspense drifting followed when shoalest water was struck he cracked on steam carried her handsomely over then began work her warily into next system shoal marks same patient heedful use leads engines followed boat slipped through without touching bottom entered upon third last intricacy crossing imperceptibly she moved through gloom crept by inches into her marks drifted tediously till shoalest water was cried then under tremendous head steam went swinging over reef away into deep water safety ealer let his long pent breath pour out great relieving sigh said that s sweetest piece piloting that was ever done on mississippi river i wouldn t believed it could be done if i hadn t seen it there was no reply he added just hold her five minutes longer partner let me run down get cup coffee minute later ealer was biting into pie down texas comforting himself with coffee just then night watchman happened was about happen out again when he noticed ealer exclaimed who is at wheel sir x dart for pilot house quicker than lightning next moment both men were flying up pilot house companion way three steps at jump nobody there great steamer was whistling down middle river at her own sweet will watchman shot out place again ealer seized wheel set engine back with power held his breath while boat reluctantly swung away from towhead which she was about knock into middle gulf mexico by by watchman came back said didn t that lunatic tell you he was asleep when he first came up here no well he was i found him walking along on top railings just as unconcerned as another man would walk pavement i put him bed now just this minute there he was again away astern going through that sort tight rope deviltry same as before well i think i ll stay by next time he has one those fits but i hope he ll have them often you just ought have seen him take this boat through helena crossing i never saw anything so gaudy before if he can do such gold leaf kid glove diamond breastpin piloting when he is sound asleep what couldn t he do if he was dead chapter 12 sounding when river is very low one s steamboat is drawing all water there is channel or few inches more as was often case old times one must be painfully circumspect his piloting we used have sound number particularly bad places almost every trip when river was at very low stage sounding is done this way boat ties up at shore just above shoal crossing pilot not on watch takes his cub or steersman picked crew men sometimes officer also goes out yawl provided boat has not that rare sumptuous luxury regularly devised sounding boat proceeds hunt for best water pilot on duty watching his movements through spy glass meantime some instances assisting by signals boat s whistle signifying try higher up or try lower down for surface water like oil painting is more expressive intelligible when inspected from little distance than very close at hand whistle signals are seldom necessary however never perhaps except when wind confuses significant ripples upon water s surface when yawl has reached shoal place speed is slackened pilot begins sound depth with pole ten or twelve feet long steersman at tiller obeys order hold her up starboard or let her fall off larboard footnote term larboard is never used at sea now signify left hand but was always used on river my time or steady steady as you go when measurements indicate that yawl is approaching shoalest part reef command is given ease all then men stop rowing yawl drifts with current next order is stand by with buoy moment shallowest point is reached pilot delivers order let go buoy over she goes if pilot is not satisfied he sounds place again if he finds better water higher up or lower down he removes buoy that place being finally satisfied he gives order all men stand their oars straight up air line blast from boat s whistle indicates that signal has been seen then men give way on their oars lay yawl alongside buoy steamer comes creeping carefully down is pointed straight at buoy husbands her power for coming struggle presently at critical moment turns on all her steam goes grinding wallowing over buoy sand gains deep water beyond or maybe she doesn t maybe she strikes swings then she has while away several hours or days sparring herself off sometimes buoy is not laid at all but yawl goes ahead hunting best water steamer follows along its wake often there is deal fun excitement about sounding especially if it is glorious summer day or blustering night but winter cold peril take most fun out it buoy is nothing but board four or five feet long with one end turned up it is reversed school house bench with one supports left other removed it is anchored on shoalest part reef by rope with heavy stone made fast end it but for resistance turned up end reversed bench current would pull buoy under water at night paper lantern with candle it is fastened on top buoy this can be seen mile or more little glimmering spark waste blackness nothing delights cub so much as opportunity go out sounding there is such air adventure about it often there is danger it is so gaudy man war like sit up stern sheets steer swift yawl there is something fine about exultant spring boat when experienced old sailor crew throw their souls into oars it is lovely see white foam stream away from bows there is music rush water it is deliciously exhilarating summer go speeding over breezy expanses river when world wavelets is dancing sun it is such grandeur too cub get chance give order for often pilot will simply say let her go about leave rest cub who instantly cries his sternest tone command ease starboard strong on larboard starboard give way with will men cub enjoys sounding for further reason that eyes passengers are watching all yawl s movements with absorbing interest if time be daylight if it be night he knows that those same wondering eyes are fastened upon yawl s lantern as it glides out into gloom dims away remote distance one trip pretty girl sixteen spent her time our pilot house with her uncle aunt every day all day long i fell love with her so did mr thornburg s cub tom g tom i had been bosom friends until this time but now coolness began arise i told girl good many my river adventures made myself out good deal hero tom tried make himself appear be hero too succeeded some extent but then he always had way embroidering however virtue is its own reward so i was barely perceptible trifle ahead contest about this time something happened which promised handsomely for me pilots decided sound crossing at head 21 this would occur about nine or ten o clock at night when passengers would be still up it would be mr thornburg s watch therefore my chief would have do sounding we had perfect love sounding boat long trim graceful as fleet as greyhound her thwarts were cushioned she carried twelve oarsmen one mates was always sent her transmit orders her crew for ours was steamer where no end style was put on we tied up at shore above 21 got ready it was foul night river was so wide there that landsman s uneducated eyes could discern no opposite shore through such gloom passengers were alert interested everything was satisfactory as i hurried through engine room picturesquely gotten up storm toggery i met tom could not forbear delivering myself mean speech ain t you glad you don t have go out sounding tom was passing on but he quickly turned said now just for that you can go get sounding pole yourself i was going after it but i d see you halifax now before i d do it who wants you get it i don t it s sounding boat it ain t either it s been new painted it s been up on ladies cabin guards two days drying i flew back shortly arrived among crowd watching wondering ladies just time hear command give way men i looked over there was gallant sounding boat booming away unprincipled tom presiding at tiller my chief sitting by him with sounding pole which i had been sent on fool s errand fetch then that young girl said me oh how awful have go out that little boat on such night do you think there is any danger i would rather have been stabbed i went off full venom help pilot house by by boat s lantern disappeared after interval wee spark glimmered upon face water mile away mr thornburg blew whistle acknowledgment backed steamer out made for it we flew along for while then slackened steam went cautiously gliding toward spark presently mr thornburg exclaimed hello buoy lantern s out he stopped engines moment or two later he said why there it is again so he came ahead on engines once more rang for leads gradually water shoaled up then began deepen again mr thornburg muttered well i don t understand this i believe that buoy has drifted off reef seems be little too far left no matter it is safest run over it anyhow so that solid world darkness we went creeping down on light just as our bows were act plowing over it mr thornburg seized bell ropes rang startling peal exclaimed my soul it s sounding boat sudden chorus wild alarms burst out far below pause then sound grinding crashing followed mr thornburg exclaimed there paddle wheel has ground sounding boat lucifer matches run see who is killed i was on main deck twinkling eye my chief third mate nearly all men were safe they had discovered their danger when it was too late pull out way then when great guards overshadowed them moment later they were prepared knew what do at my chiefs order they sprang at right instant seized guard were hauled aboard next moment sounding yawl swept aft wheel was struck splintered atoms two men cub tom were missing fact which spread like wildfire over boat passengers came flocking forward gangway ladies all anxious eyed white faced talked awed voices dreadful thing often again i heard them say poor fellows poor boy poor boy by this time boat s yawl was manned away search for missing now faint call was heard off left yawl had disappeared other direction half people rushed one side encourage swimmer with their shouts other half rushed other way shriek yawl turn about by callings swimmer was approaching but some said sound showed failing strength crowd massed themselves against boiler deck railings leaning over staring into gloom every faint fainter cry wrung from them such words as ah poor fellow poor fellow is there no way save him but still cries held out drew nearer presently voice said pluckily i can make it stand by with rope what rousing cheer they gave him chief mate took his stand glare torch basket coil rope his hand his men grouped about him next moment swimmer s face appeared circle light another one owner it was hauled aboard limp drenched while cheer on cheer went up it was that devil tom yawl crew searched everywhere but found no sign two men they probably failed catch guard tumbled back were struck by wheel killed tom had never jumped for guard at all but had plunged head first into river dived under wheel it was nothing i could have done it easy enough i said so but everybody went on just same making wonderful do over that ass as if he had done something great that girl couldn t seem have enough that pitiful hero rest trip but little i cared i loathed her any way way we came mistake sounding boat s lantern for buoy light was this my chief said that after laying buoy he fell away watched it till it seemed be secure then he took up position hundred yards below it little one side steamer s course headed sounding boat up stream waited having wait some time he officer got talking he looked up when he judged that steamer was about on reef saw that buoy was gone but supposed that steamer had already run over it he went on with his talk he noticed that steamer was getting very close on him but that was correct thing it was her business shave him closely for convenience taking him aboard he was expecting her sheer off until last moment then it flashed upon him that she was trying run him down mistaking his lantern for buoy light so he sang out stand by spring for guard men next instant jump was made chapter 13 pilot s needs but i am wandering from what i was intending do that is make plainer than perhaps appears previous chapters some peculiar requirements science piloting first all there is one faculty which pilot must incessantly cultivate until he has brought it absolute perfection nothing short perfection will do that faculty is memory he cannot stop with merely thinking thing is so so he must know it for this is eminently one exact sciences with what scorn pilot was looked upon old times if he ever ventured deal that feeble phrase i think instead vigorous one i know one cannot easily realize what tremendous thing it is know every trivial detail twelve hundred miles river know it with absolute exactness if you will take longest street new york travel up down it conning its features patiently until you know every house window door lamp post big little sign by heart know them so accurately that you can instantly name one you are abreast when you are set down at random that street middle inky black night you will then have tolerable notion amount exactness pilot s knowledge who carries mississippi river his head then if you will go on until you know every street crossing character size position crossing stones varying depth mud each those numberless places you will have some idea what pilot must know order keep mississippi steamer out trouble next if you will take half signs that long street change their places once month still manage know their new positions accurately on dark nights keep up with these repeated changes without making any mistakes you will understand what is required pilot s peerless memory by fickle mississippi i think pilot s memory is about most wonderful thing world know old new testaments by heart be able recite them glibly forward or backward or begin at random anywhere book recite both ways never trip or make mistake is no extravagant mass knowledge no marvelous facility compared pilot s massed knowledge mississippi his marvelous facility handling it i make this comparison deliberately believe i am not expanding truth when i do it many will think my figure too strong but pilots will not how easily comfortably pilot s memory does its work how placidly effortless is its way how unconsciously it lays up its vast stores hour by hour day by day never loses or mislays single valuable package them all take instance let leadsman cry half twain half twain half twain half twain half twain until it become as monotonous as ticking clock let conversation be going on all time pilot be doing his share talking no longer consciously listening leadsman midst this endless string half twains let single quarter twain be interjected without emphasis then half twain cry go on again just as before two or three weeks later that pilot can describe with precision boat s position river when that quarter twain was uttered give you such lot head marks stern marks side marks guide you that you ought be able take boat there put her that same spot again yourself cry quarter twain did not really take his mind from his talk but his trained faculties instantly photographed bearings noted change depth laid up important details for future reference without requiring any assistance from him matter if you were walking talking with friend another friend at your side kept up monotonous repetition vowel sound for couple blocks then midst interjected r thus r etc gave r no emphasis you would not be able state two or three weeks afterward that r had been put nor be able tell what objects you were passing at moment it was done but you could if your memory had been patiently laboriously trained do that sort thing mechanically give man tolerably fair memory start with piloting will develop it into very colossus capability but only matters it is daily drilled time would come when man s faculties could not help noticing landmarks soundings his memory could not help holding on them with grip vise but if you asked that same man at noon what he had had for breakfast it would be ten chances one that he could not tell you astonishing things can be done with human memory if you will devote it faithfully one particular line business at time that wages soared so high on missouri river my chief mr bixby went up there learned more than thousand miles that stream with ease rapidity that were astonishing when he had seen each division once daytime once at night his education was so nearly complete that he took out daylight license few trips later he took out full license went piloting day night he ranked 1 too mr bixby placed me as steersman for while under pilot whose feats memory were constant marvel me however his memory was born him i think not built for instance somebody would mention name instantly mr brown would break oh i knew him sallow faced red headed fellow with little scar on side his throat like splinter under flesh he was only southern trade six months that was thirteen years ago i made trip with him there was five feet upper river then henry blake grounded at foot tower island drawing four half george elliott unshipped her rudder on wreck sunflower why sunflower didn t sink until i know when she sunk it was three years before that on 2nd december asa hardy was captain her his brother john was first clerk it was his first trip her too tom jones told me these things week afterward new orleans he was first mate sunflower captain hardy stuck nail his foot 6th july next year died lockjaw on 15th his brother died two years after 3rd march erysipelas i never saw either hardys they were alleghany river men but people who knew them told me all these things they said captain hardy wore yarn socks winter summer just same his first wife s name was jane shook she was from new england his second one died lunatic asylum it was blood she was from lexington kentucky name was horton before she was married so on by hour man s tongue would go he could not forget any thing it was simply impossible most trivial details remained as distinct luminous his head after they had lain there for years as most memorable events his was not simply pilot s memory its grasp was universal if he were talking about trifling letter he had received seven years before he was pretty sure deliver you entire screed from memory then without observing that he was departing from true line his talk he was more than likely hurl long drawn parenthetical biography writer that letter you were lucky indeed if he did not take up that writer s relatives one by one give you their biographies too such memory as that is great misfortune it all occurrences are same size its possessor cannot distinguish interesting circumstance from uninteresting one as talker he is bound clog his narrative with tiresome details make himself insufferable bore moreover he cannot stick his subject he picks up every little grain memory he discerns his way so is led aside mr brown would start out with honest intention telling you vastly funny anecdote about dog he would be so full laugh that he could hardly begin then his memory would start with dog s breed personal appearance drift into history his owner his owner s family with descriptions weddings burials that had occurred it together with recitals congratulatory verses obituary poetry provoked by same then this memory would recollect that one these events occurred during celebrated hard winter such such year minute description that winter would follow along with names people who were frozen death statistics showing high figures which pork hay went up pork hay would suggest corn fodder corn fodder would suggest cows horses cows horses would suggest circus certain celebrated bare back riders transition from circus menagerie was easy natural from elephant equatorial africa was but step then course heathen savages would suggest religion at end three or four hours tedious jaw watch would change brown would go out pilot house muttering extracts from sermons he had heard years before about efficacy prayer as means grace original first mention would be all you had learned about that dog after all this waiting hungering pilot must have memory but there are two higher qualities which he must also have he must have good quick judgment decision cool calm courage that no peril can shake give man merest trifle pluck start with by time he has become pilot he cannot be unmanned by any danger steamboat can get into but one cannot quite say same for judgment judgment is matter brains man must start with good stock that article or he will never succeed as pilot growth courage pilot house is steady all time but it does not reach high satisfactory condition until some time after young pilot has been standing his own watch alone under staggering weight all responsibilities connected with position when apprentice has become pretty thoroughly acquainted with river he goes clattering along so fearlessly with his steamboat night or day that he presently begins imagine that it is his courage that animates him but first time pilot steps out leaves him his own devices he finds out it was other man s he discovers that article has been left out his own cargo altogether whole river is bristling with exigencies moment he is not prepared for them he does not know how meet them all his knowledge forsakes him within fifteen minutes he is as white as sheet scared almost death therefore pilots wisely train these cubs by various strategic tricks look danger face little more calmly favorite way theirs is play friendly swindle upon candidate mr bixby served me this fashion once for years afterward i used blush even my sleep when i thought it i had become good steersman so good indeed that i had all work do on our watch night day mr bixby seldom made suggestion me all he ever did was take wheel on particularly bad nights or particularly bad crossings land boat when she needed be landed play gentleman leisure nine tenths watch collect wages lower river was about bank full if anybody had questioned my ability run any crossing between cairo new orleans without help or instruction i should have felt irreparably hurt idea being afraid any crossing lot day time was thing too preposterous for contemplation well one matchless summer s day i was bowling down bend above island 66 brimful self conceit carrying my nose as high as giraffe s when mr bixby said i am going below while i suppose you know next crossing this was almost affront it was about plainest simplest crossing whole river one couldn t come any harm whether he ran it right or not as for depth there never had been any bottom there i knew all this perfectly well know how run it why i can run it with my eyes shut how much water is there it well that is odd question i couldn t get bottom there with church steeple you think so do you very tone question shook my confidence that was what mr bixby was expecting he left without saying anything more i began imagine all sorts things mr bixby unknown me course sent somebody down forecastle with some mysterious instructions leadsmen another messenger was sent whisper among officers then mr bixby went into hiding behind smoke stack where he could observe results presently captain stepped out on hurricane deck next chief mate appeared then clerk every moment or two straggler was added my audience before i got head island i had fifteen or twenty people assembled down there under my nose i began wonder what trouble was as i started across captain glanced aloft at me said with sham uneasiness his voice where is mr bixby gone below sir but that did business for me my imagination began construct dangers out nothing they multiplied faster than i could keep run them all at once i imagined i saw shoal water ahead wave coward agony that surged through me then came near dislocating every joint me all my confidence that crossing vanished i seized bell rope dropped it ashamed seized it again dropped it once more clutched it tremblingly one again pulled it so feebly that i could hardly hear stroke myself captain mate sang out instantly both together starboard lead there quick about it this was another shock i began climb wheel like squirrel but i would hardly get boat started port before i would see new dangers on that side away i would spin other only find perils accumulating starboard be crazy get port again then came leadsman s sepulchral cry d e e p four deep four bottomless crossing terror it took my breath away m r k three m r k three quarter less three half twain this was frightful i seized bell ropes stopped engines quarter twain quarter twain mark twain i was helpless i did not know what world do i was quaking from head foot i could have hung my hat on my eyes they stuck out so far quarter less twain nine half we were drawing nine my hands were nerveless flutter i could not ring bell intelligibly with them i flew speaking tube shouted engineer oh ben if you love me back her quick ben oh back immortal soul out her i heard door close gently i looked around there stood mr bixby smiling bland sweet smile then audience on hurricane deck sent up thundergust humiliating laughter i saw it all now i felt meaner than meanest man human history i laid lead set boat her marks came ahead on engines said it was fine trick play on orphan wasn t it i suppose i ll never hear last how i was ass enough heave lead at head 66 well no you won t maybe fact i hope you won t for i want you learn something by that experience didn t you know there was no bottom that crossing yes sir i did very well then you shouldn t have allowed me or anybody else shake your confidence that knowledge try remember that another thing when you get into dangerous place don t turn coward that isn t going help matters any it was good enough lesson but pretty hardly learned yet about hardest part it was that for months i so often had hear phrase which i had conceived particular distaste for it was oh ben if you love me back her chapter 14 rank dignity piloting my preceding chapters i have tried by going into minutiae science piloting carry reader step by step comprehension what science consists at same time i have tried show him that it is very curious wonderful science too very worthy his attention if i have seemed love my subject it is no surprising thing for i loved profession far better than any i have followed since i took measureless pride it reason is plain pilot those days was only unfettered entirely independent human being that lived earth kings are but hampered servants parliament people parliaments sit chains forged by their constituency editor newspaper cannot be independent but must work with one hand tied behind him by party patrons be content utter only half or two thirds his mind no clergyman is free man may speak whole truth regardless his parish s opinions writers all kinds are manacled servants public we write frankly fearlessly but then we modify before we print truth every man woman child has master worries frets servitude but day i write mississippi pilot had none captain could stand upon hurricane deck pomp very brief authority give him five or six orders while vessel backed into stream then that skipper s reign was over moment that boat was under way river she was under sole unquestioned control pilot he could do with her exactly as he pleased run her when whither he chose tie her up bank whenever his judgment said that that course was best his movements were entirely free he consulted no one he received commands from nobody he promptly resented even merest suggestions indeed law united states forbade him listen commands or suggestions rightly considering that pilot necessarily knew better how handle boat than anybody could tell him so here was novelty king without keeper absolute monarch who was absolute sober truth not by fiction words i have seen boy eighteen taking great steamer serenely into what seemed almost certain destruction aged captain standing mutely by filled with apprehension but powerless interfere his interference that particular instance might have been excellent thing but permit it would have been establish most pernicious precedent it will easily be guessed considering pilot s boundless authority that he was great personage old steamboating days he was treated with marked courtesy by captain with marked deference by all officers servants this deferential spirit was quickly communicated passengers too i think pilots were about only people i ever knew who failed show some degree embarrassment presence traveling foreign princes but then people one s own grade life are not usually embarrassing objects by long habit pilots came put all their wishes form commands it gravels me this day put my will weak shape request instead launching it crisp language order those old days load steamboat at st louis take her new orleans back discharge cargo consumed about twenty five days on average seven or eight these days boat spent at wharves st louis new orleans every soul on board was hard at work except two pilots they did nothing but play gentleman up town receive same wages for it as if they had been on duty moment boat touched wharf at either city they were ashore they were not likely be seen again till last bell was ringing everything readiness for another voyage when captain got hold pilot particularly high reputation he took pains keep him when wages were four hundred dollars month on upper mississippi i have known captain keep such pilot idleness under full pay three months at time while river was frozen up one must remember that those cheap times four hundred dollars was salary almost inconceivable splendor few men on shore got such pay as that when they did they were mightily looked up when pilots from either end river wandered into our small missouri village they were sought by best fairest treated with exalted respect lying port under wages was thing which many pilots greatly enjoyed appreciated especially if they belonged missouri river heyday that trade kansas times got nine hundred dollars trip which was equivalent about eighteen hundred dollars month here is conversation that day chap out illinois river with little stern wheel tub accosts couple ornate gilded missouri river pilots gentlemen i ve got pretty good trip for upcountry shall want you about month how much will it be eighteen hundred dollars apiece heavens earth you take my boat let me have your wages i ll divide i will remark passing that mississippi steamboatmen were important landsmen s eyes their own too degree according dignity boat they were on for instance it was proud thing be crew such stately craft as aleck scott or grand turk negro firemen deck hands barbers belonging those boats were distinguished personages their grade life they were well aware that fact too stalwart darkey once gave offense at negro ball new orleans by putting on good many airs finally one managers bustled up him said who is you any way who is you dat s what i wants know offender was not disconcerted least but swelled himself up threw that into his voice which showed that he knew he was not putting on all those airs on stinted capital who is i who is i i let you know mighty quick who i is i want you niggers understan dat i fires de middle do footnote door on de aleck scott that was sufficient barber grand turk was spruce young negro who aired his importance with balmy complacency was greatly courted by circle which he moved young colored population new orleans were much given flirting at twilight on banquettes back streets somebody saw heard something like following one evening one those localities middle aged negro woman projected her head through broken pane shouted very willing that neighbors should hear envy you mary ann come de house dis minute stannin out dah foolin long wid dat low trash heah s de barber offn de gran turk wants conwerse wid you my reference moment ago fact that pilot s peculiar official position placed him out reach criticism or command brings stephen w naturally my mind he was gifted pilot good fellow tireless talker had both wit humor him he had most irreverent independence too was deliciously easy going comfortable presence age official dignity even most august wealth he always had work he never saved penny he was most persuasive borrower he was debt every pilot on river majority captains he could throw sort splendor around bit harum scarum devil may care piloting that made it almost fascinating but not everybody he made trip with good old captain y once was relieved from duty when boat got new orleans somebody expressed surprise at discharge captain y shuddered at mere mention stephen then his poor thin old voice piped out something like this why bless me i wouldn t have such wild creature on my boat for world not for whole world he swears he sings he whistles he yells i never saw such injun yell all times night it never made any difference him he would just yell that way not for anything particular but merely on account kind devilish comfort he got out it i never could get into sound sleep but he would fetch me out bed all cold sweat with one those dreadful war whoops queer being very queer being no respect for anything or anybody sometimes he called me johnny he kept fiddle cat he played execrably this seemed distress cat so cat would howl nobody could sleep where that man his family was reckless there never was anything like it now you may believe it or not but as sure as i am sitting here he brought my boat tilting down through those awful snags at chicot under rattling head steam wind blowing like very nation at that my officers will tell you so they saw it sir while he was tearing right down through those snags i shaking my shoes praying i wish i may never speak again if he didn t pucker up his mouth go whistling yes sir whistling buffalo gals can t you come out tonight can t you come out night can t you come out night doing it as calmly as if we were attending funeral weren t related corpse when i remonstrated with him about it he smiled down on me as if i was his child told me run house try be good not be meddling with my superiors once pretty mean captain caught stephen new orleans out work as usual out money he laid steady siege stephen who was very close place finally persuaded him hire with him at one hundred twenty five dollars per month just half wages captain agreeing not divulge secret so bring down contempt all guild upon poor fellow but boat was not more than day out new orleans before stephen discovered that captain was boasting his exploit that all officers had been told stephen winced but said nothing about middle afternoon captain stepped out on hurricane deck cast his eye around looked good deal surprised he glanced inquiringly aloft at stephen but stephen was whistling placidly attending business captain stood around while evident discomfort once or twice seemed about make suggestion but etiquette river taught him avoid that sort rashness so he managed hold his peace he chafed puzzled few minutes longer then retired his apartments but soon he was out again apparently more perplexed than ever presently he ventured remark with deference pretty good stage river now ain t it sir well i should say so bank full is pretty liberal stage seems be good deal current here good deal don t describe it it s worse than mill race isn t it easier toward shore than it is out here middle yes i reckon it is but body can t be too careful with steamboat it s pretty safe out here can t strike any bottom here you can depend on that captain departed looking rueful enough at this rate he would probably die old age before his boat got st louis next day he appeared on deck again found stephen faithfully standing up middle river fighting whole vast force mississippi whistling same placid tune this thing was becoming serious by shore was slower boat clipping along easy water gaining steadily she began make for island chute stephen stuck middle river speech was wrung from captain he said mr w don t that chute cut off good deal distance i think it does but i don t know don t know well isn t there water enough it now go through i expect there is but i am not certain upon my word this is odd why those pilots on that boat yonder are going try it do you mean say that you don t know as much as they do they why they are two hundred fifty dollar pilots but don t you be uneasy i know as much as any man can afford know for hundred twenty five captain surrendered five minutes later stephen was bowling through chute showing rival boat two hundred fifty dollar pair heels chapter 15 pilots monopoly one day on board aleck scott my chief mr bixby was crawling carefully through close place at cat island both leads going everybody holding his breath captain nervous apprehensive man kept still as long as he could but finally broke down shouted from hurricane deck for gracious sake give her steam mr bixby give her steam she ll never raise reef on this headway for all effect that was produced upon mr bixby one would have supposed that no remark had been made but five minutes later when danger was past leads laid he burst instantly into consuming fury gave captain most admirable cursing i ever listened no bloodshed ensued but that was because captain s cause was weak for ordinarily he was not man take correction quietly having now set forth detail nature science piloting likewise described rank which pilot held among fraternity steamboatmen this seems fitting place say few words about organization which pilots once formed for protection their guild it was curious noteworthy this that it was perhaps compactest completest strongest commercial organization ever formed among men for long time wages had been two hundred fifty dollars month but curiously enough as steamboats multiplied business increased wages began fall little by little it was easy discover reason this too many pilots were being made it was nice have cub steersman do all hard work for couple years gratis while his master sat on high bench smoked all pilots captains had sons or nephews who wanted be pilots by by it came pass that nearly every pilot on river had steersman when steersman had made amount progress that was satisfactory any two pilots trade they could get pilot s license for him by signing application directed united states inspector nothing further was needed usually no questions were asked no proofs capacity required very well this growing swarm new pilots presently began undermine wages order get berths too late apparently knights tiller perceived their mistake plainly something had be done quickly but what was be needful thing close organization nothing else would answer compass this seemed impossibility so it was talked talked then dropped it was too likely ruin whoever ventured move matter but at last about dozen boldest some them best pilots on river launched themselves into enterprise took all chances they got special charter from legislature with large powers under name pilots benevolent association elected their officers completed their organization contributed capital put association wages up two hundred fifty dollars at once then retired their homes for they were promptly discharged from employment but there were two or three unnoticed trifles their by laws which had seeds propagation them for instance all idle members association good standing were entitled pension twenty five dollars per month this began bring one straggler after another from ranks new fledged pilots dull summer season better have twenty five dollars than starve initiation fee was only twelve dollars no dues required from unemployed also widows deceased members good standing could draw twenty five dollars per month certain sum for each their children also said deceased would be buried at association s expense these things resurrected all superannuated forgotten pilots mississippi valley they came from farms they came from interior villages they came from everywhere they came on crutches on drays ambulances any way so they got there they paid their twelve dollars straightway began draw out twenty five dollars month calculate their burial bills by by all useless helpless pilots dozen first class ones were association nine tenths best pilots out it laughing at it it was laughing stock whole river everybody joked about by law requiring members pay ten per cent their wages every month into treasury for support association whereas all members were outcast tabooed no one would employ them everybody was derisively grateful association for taking all worthless pilots out way leaving whole field excellent deserving everybody was not only jocularly grateful for that but for result which naturally followed namely gradual advance wages as busy season approached wages had gone up from low figure one hundred dollars month one hundred twenty five some cases one hundred fifty it was great fun enlarge upon fact that this charming thing had been accomplished by body men not one whom received particle benefit from it some jokers used call at association rooms have good time chaffing members offering them charity taking them as steersmen for trip so that they could see what forgotten river looked like however association was content or at least it gave no sign contrary now then it captured pilot who was out luck added him its list these later additions were very valuable for they were good pilots incompetent ones had all been absorbed before as business freshened wages climbed gradually up two hundred fifty dollars association figure became firmly fixed there still without benefiting member that body for no member was hired hilarity at association s expense burst all bounds now there was no end fun which that poor martyr had put up with however it is long lane that has no turning winter approached business doubled trebled avalanche missouri illinois upper mississippi river boats came pouring down take chance new orleans trade all sudden pilots were great demand were correspondingly scarce time for revenge was come it was bitter pill have accept association pilots at last yet captains owners agreed that there was no other way but none these outcasts offered so there was still bitterer pill be swallowed they must be sought out asked for their services captain was first man who found it necessary take dose he had been loudest derider organization he hunted up one best association pilots said well you boys have rather got best us for little while so i ll give with as good grace as i can i ve come hire you get your trunk aboard right away i want leave at twelve o clock i don t know about that who is your other pilot i ve got i s why i can t go with him he don t belong association what it s so do you mean tell me that you won t turn wheel with one very best oldest pilots on river because he don t belong your association yes i do well if this isn t putting on airs i supposed i was doing you benevolence but i begin think that i am party that wants favor done are you acting under law concern yes show it me so they stepped into association rooms secretary soon satisfied captain who said well what am i do i have hired mr s for entire season i will provide for you said secretary i will detail pilot go with you he shall be on board at twelve o clock but if i discharge s he will come on me for whole season s wages course that is matter between you mr s captain we cannot meddle your private affairs captain stormed but no purpose end he had discharge s pay him about thousand dollars take association pilot his place laugh was beginning turn other way now every day thenceforward new victim fell every day some outraged captain discharged non association pet with tears profanity installed hated association man his berth very little while idle non associationists began be pretty plenty brisk as business was much as their services were desired laugh was shifting other side their mouths most palpably these victims together with captains owners presently ceased laugh altogether began rage about revenge they would take when passing business spurt was over soon all laughers that were left were owners crews boats that had two non association pilots but their triumph was not very long lived for this reason it was rigid rule association that its members should never under any circumstances whatever give information about channel any outsider by this time about half boats had none but association pilots other half had none but outsiders at first glance one would suppose that when it came forbidding information about river these two parties could play equally at that game but this was not so at every good sized town from one end river other there was wharf boat land at instead wharf or pier freight was stored it for transportation waiting passengers slept its cabins upon each these wharf boats association s officers placed strong box fastened with peculiar lock which was used no other service but one united states mail service it was letter bag lock sacred governmental thing by dint much beseeching government had been persuaded allow association use this lock every association man carried key which would open these boxes that key or rather peculiar way holding it hand when its owner was asked for river information by stranger for success st louis new orleans association had now bred tolerably thriving branches dozen neighboring steamboat trades was association man s sign diploma membership if stranger did not respond by producing similar key holding it certain manner duly prescribed his question was politely ignored from association s secretary each member received package more or less gorgeous blanks printed like billhead on handsome paper properly ruled columns bill head worded something like this these blanks were filled up day by day as voyage progressed deposited several wharf boat boxes for instance as soon as first crossing out from st louis was completed items would be entered upon blank under appropriate headings thus st louis nine half feet stern on court house head on dead cottonwood above wood yard until you raise first reef then pull up square then under head remarks go just outside wrecks this is important new snag just where you straighten down go above it pilot who deposited that blank cairo box after adding it details every crossing all way down from st louis took out read half dozen fresh reports from upward bound steamers concerning river between cairo memphis posted himself thoroughly returned them box went back aboard his boat again so armed against accident that he could not possibly get his boat into trouble without bringing most ingenious carelessness his aid imagine benefits so admirable system piece river twelve or thirteen hundred miles long whose channel was shifting every day pilot who had formerly been obliged put up with seeing shoal place once or possibly twice month had hundred sharp eyes watch it for him now bushels intelligent brains tell him how run it his information about it was seldom twenty four hours old if reports last box chanced leave any misgivings on his mind concerning treacherous crossing he had his remedy he blew his steam whistle peculiar way as soon as he saw boat approaching signal was answered peculiar way if that boat s pilots were association men then two steamers ranged alongside all uncertainties were swept away by fresh information furnished inquirer by word mouth minute detail first thing pilot did when he reached new orleans or st louis was take his final elaborate report association parlors hang it up there after which he was free visit his family these parlors crowd was always gathered together discussing changes channel moment there was fresh arrival everybody stopped talking till this witness had told newest news settled latest uncertainty other craftsmen can sink shop sometimes interest themselves other matters not so with pilot he must devote himself wholly his profession talk nothing else for it would be small gain be perfect one day imperfect next he has no time or words waste if he would keep posted but outsiders had hard time it no particular place meet exchange information no wharf boat reports none but chance unsatisfactory ways getting news consequence was that man sometimes had run five hundred miles river on information that was week or ten days old at fair stage river that might have answered but when dead low water came it was destructive now came another perfectly logical result outsiders began ground steamboats sink them get into all sorts trouble whereas accidents seemed keep entirely away from association men wherefore even owners captains boats furnished exclusively with outsiders previously considered be wholly independent association free comfort themselves with brag laughter began feel pretty uncomfortable still they made show keeping up brag until one black day when every captain lot was formally ordered immediately discharge his outsiders take association pilots their stead who was it that had dashing presumption do that alas it came from power behind throne that was greater than throne itself it was underwriters it was no time swap knives every outsider had take his trunk ashore at once course it was supposed that there was collusion between association underwriters but this was not so latter had come comprehend excellence report system association safety it secured so they had made their decision among themselves upon plain business principles there was weeping wailing gnashing teeth camp outsiders now but no matter there was but one course for them pursue they pursued it they came forward couples groups proffered their twelve dollars asked for membership they were surprised learn that several new by laws had been long ago added for instance initiation fee had been raised fifty dollars that sum must be tendered also ten per cent wages which applicant had received each every month since founding association many cases this amounted three or four hundred dollars still association would not entertain application until money was present even then single adverse vote killed application every member had vote yes or no person before witnesses so it took weeks decide candidacy because many pilots were so long absent on voyages however repentant sinners scraped their savings together one by one by our tedious voting process they were added fold time came at last when only about ten remained outside they said they would starve before they would apply they remained idle long while because course nobody could venture employ them by by association published fact that upon certain date wages would be raised five hundred dollars per month all branch associations had grown strong now red river one had advanced wages seven hundred dollars month reluctantly ten outsiders yielded view these things made application there was another new by law by this time which required them pay dues not only on all wages they had received since association was born but also on what they would have received if they had continued at work up time their application instead going off pout idleness it turned out be difficult matter elect them but it was accomplished at last most virulent sinner this batch had stayed out allowed dues accumulate against him so long that he had send six hundred twenty five dollars with his application association had good bank account now was very strong there was no longer outsider by law was added forbidding reception any more cubs or apprentices for five years after which time limited number would be taken not by individuals but by association upon these terms applicant must not be less than eighteen years old respectable family good character he must pass examination as education pay thousand dollars advance for privilege becoming apprentice must remain under commands association until great part membership more than half i think should be willing sign his application for pilot s license all previously articled apprentices were now taken away from their masters adopted by association president secretary detailed them for service on one boat or another as they chose changed them from boat boat according certain rules if pilot could show that he was infirm health needed assistance one cubs would be ordered go with him widow orphan list grew but so did association s financial resources association attended its own funerals state paid for them when occasion demanded it sent members down river upon searches for bodies brethren lost by steamboat accidents search this kind sometimes cost thousand dollars association procured charter went into insurance business also it not only insured lives its members but took risks on steamboats organization seemed indestructible it was tightest monopoly world by united states law no man could become pilot unless two duly licensed pilots signed his application now there was nobody outside association competent sign consequently making pilots was at end every year some would die others become incapacitated by age infirmity there would be no new ones take their places time association could put wages up any figure it chose as long as it should be wise enough not carry thing too far provoke national government into amending licensing system steamboat owners would have submit since there would be no help for it owners captains were only obstruction that lay between association absolute power at last this one was removed incredible as it may seem owners captains deliberately did it themselves when pilots association announced months beforehand that on first day september 1861 wages would be advanced five hundred dollars per month owners captains instantly put freights up few cents explained farmers along river necessity it by calling their attention burdensome rate wages about be established it was rather slender argument but farmers did not seem detect it it looked reasonable them that add five cents freight on bushel corn was justifiable under circumstances overlooking fact that this advance on cargo forty thousand sacks was good deal more than necessary cover new wages so straightway captains owners got up association their own proposed put captains wages up five hundred dollars too move for another advance freights it was novel idea but course effect which had been produced once could be produced again new association decreed for this was before all outsiders had been taken into pilots association that if any captain employed non association pilot he should be forced discharge him also pay fine five hundred dollars several these heavy fines were paid before captains organization grew strong enough exercise full authority over its membership but that all ceased presently captains tried get pilots decree that no member their corporation should serve under non association captain but this proposition was declined pilots saw that they would be backed up by captains underwriters anyhow so they wisely refrained from entering into entangling alliances as i have remarked pilots association was now compactest monopoly world perhaps seemed simply indestructible yet days its glory were numbered first new railroad stretching up through mississippi tennessee kentucky northern railway centers began divert passenger travel from steamers next war came almost entirely annihilated steamboating industry during several years leaving most pilots idle cost living advancing all time then treasurer st louis association put his hand into till walked off with every dollar ample fund finally railroads intruding everywhere there was little for steamers do when war was over but carry freights so straightway some genius from atlantic coast introduced plan towing dozen steamer cargoes down new orleans at tail vulgar little tug boat behold twinkling eye as it were association noble science piloting were things dead pathetic past chapter 16 racing days it was always custom for boats leave new orleans between four five o clock afternoon from three o clock onward they would be burning rosin pitch pine sign preparation so one had picturesque spectacle rank some two or three miles long tall ascending columns coal black smoke colonnade which supported sable roof same smoke blended together spreading abroad over city every outward bound boat had its flag flying at jack staff sometimes duplicate on verge staff astern two or three miles mates were commanding swearing with more than usual emphasis countless processions freight barrels boxes were spinning athwart levee flying aboard stage planks belated passengers were dodging skipping among these frantic things hoping reach forecastle companion way alive but having their doubts about it women with reticules bandboxes were trying keep up with husbands freighted with carpet sacks crying babies making failure it by losing their heads whirl roar general distraction drays baggage vans were clattering hither thither wild hurry every now then getting blocked jammed together then during ten seconds one could not see them for profanity except vaguely dimly every windlass connected with every forehatch from one end that long array steamboats other was keeping up deafening whiz whir lowering freight into hold half naked crews perspiring negroes that worked them were roaring such songs as de las sack de las sack inspired unimaginable exaltation by chaos turmoil racket that was driving everybody else mad by this time hurricane boiler decks steamers would be packed black with passengers last bells would begin clang all down line then powwow seemed double moment or two final warning came simultaneous din chinese gongs with cry all dat ain t goin please git asho behold powwow quadrupled people came swarming ashore overturning excited stragglers that were trying swarm aboard one more moment later long array stage planks was being hauled each with its customary latest passenger clinging end it with teeth nails everything else customary latest procrastinator making wild spring shoreward over his head now number boats slide backward into stream leaving wide gaps serried rank steamers citizens crowd decks boats that are not go order see sight steamer after steamer straightens herself up gathers all her strength presently comes swinging by under tremendous head steam with flag flying black smoke rolling her entire crew firemen deck hands usually swarthy negroes massed together on forecastle best voice lot towering from midst being mounted on capstan waving his hat or flag all roaring mighty chorus while parting cannons boom multitudinous spectators swing their hats huzza steamer after steamer falls into line stately procession goes winging its flight up river old times whenever two fast boats started out on race with big crowd people looking on it was inspiring hear crews sing especially if time were night fall forecastle lit up with red glare torch baskets racing was royal fun public always had idea that racing was dangerous whereas opposite was case that is after laws were passed which restricted each boat just so many pounds steam square inch no engineer was ever sleepy or careless when his heart was race he was constantly on alert trying gauge cocks watching things dangerous place was on slow plodding boats where engineers drowsed around allowed chips get into doctor shut off water supply from boilers flush times steamboating race between two notoriously fleet steamers was event vast importance date was set for it several weeks advance from that time forward whole mississippi valley was state consuming excitement politics weather were dropped people talked only coming race as time approached two steamers stripped got ready every encumbrance that added weight or exposed resisting surface wind or water was removed if boat could possibly do without it spars sometimes even their supporting derricks were sent ashore no means left set boat afloat case she got aground when eclipse l shotwell ran their great race many years ago it was said that pains were taken scrape gilding off fanciful device which hung between eclipse s chimneys that for that one trip captain left off his kid gloves had his head shaved but i always doubted these things if boat was known make her best speed when drawing five half feet forward five feet aft she was carefully loaded that exact figure she wouldn t enter dose homoeopathic pills on her manifest after that hardly any passengers were taken because they not only add weight but they never will trim boat they always run side when there is anything see whereas conscientious experienced steamboatman would stick center boat part his hair middle with spirit level no way freights no way passengers were allowed for racers would stop only at largest towns then it would be only touch go coal flats wood flats were contracted for beforehand these were kept ready hitch on flying steamers at moment s warning double crews were carried so that all work could be quickly done chosen date being come all things readiness two great steamers back into stream

twelve hundred miles welcome these racers presently tall columns steam burst from scape pipes both steamers two guns boom good bye two red shirted heroes mounted on capstans wave their small flags

should be on board when they take couple those wood boats tow turn swarm men into each by time you have wiped your glasses put them on you will be wondering what has become that wood two nicely matched steamers will stay sight each other day after day they might even stay side by side but for fact that pilots are not all alike smartest pilots will win race if one boats has lightning pilot whose partner is trifle his inferior you can tell which one is on watch by noting whether that boat has gained ground or lost some during each four hour stretch shrewdest pilot can delay boat if he has not fine genius for steering steering is very high art one must not keep rudder dragging across boat s stem if he wants get up river fast there is great difference boats course for long time i was on boat that was so slow we used forget what year it was we left port but course this was at rare intervals ferryboats used lose valuable trips because their passengers grew old died waiting for us get by this was at still rarer intervals i had documents for these occurrences but through carelessness they have been mislaid this boat john j roe was so slow that when she finally sunk madrid bend it was five years before owners heard it that was always confusing fact me but it is according record any way she was dismally slow still we often had pretty exciting times racing with islands rafts such things one trip however we did rather well we went st louis sixteen days but even at this rattling gait i think we changed watches three times fort adams reach which is five miles long reach is piece straight river course current drives through such place pretty lively way that trip we went grand gulf from new orleans four days three hundred forty miles eclipse shotwell did it one we were nine days out chute 63 seven hundred miles eclipse shotwell went there two days something over generation ago boat called j m white went from new orleans cairo three days six hours forty four minutes 1853 eclipse made same trip three days three hours twenty minutes footnote time disputed some authorities add 1 hour 16 minutes this 1870 r e lee did it three days one hour this last is called fastest trip on record i will try show that it was not for this reason distance between new orleans cairo when j m white ran it was about eleven hundred six miles consequently her average speed was trifle over fourteen miles per hour eclipse s day distance between two ports had become reduced one thousand eighty miles consequently her average speed was shade under fourteen three eighths miles per hour r e lee s time distance had diminished about one thousand thirty miles consequently her average was about fourteen one eighth miles per hour therefore eclipse s was conspicuously fastest time that has ever been made chapter 17 cut offs stephen these dry details are importance one particular they give me opportunity introducing one mississippi s oddest peculiarities that shortening its length from time time if you will throw long pliant apple paring over your shoulder it will pretty fairly shape itself into average section mississippi river that is nine or ten hundred miles stretching from cairo illinois southward new orleans same being wonderfully crooked with brief straight bit here there at wide intervals two hundred mile stretch from cairo northward st louis is by no means so crooked that being rocky country which river cannot cut much water cuts alluvial banks lower river into deep horseshoe curves so deep indeed that some places if you were get ashore at one extremity horseshoe walk across neck half or three quarters mile you could sit down rest couple hours while your steamer was coming around long elbow at speed ten miles hour take you aboard again when river is rising fast some scoundrel whose plantation is back country therefore inferior value has only watch his chance cut little gutter across narrow neck land some dark night turn water into it wonderfully short time miracle has happened wit whole mississippi has taken possession that little ditch placed countryman s plantation on its bank quadrupling its value that other party s formerly valuable plantation finds itself away out yonder on big island old watercourse around it will soon shoal up boats cannot approach within ten miles it down goes its value fourth its former worth watches are kept on those narrow necks at needful times if man happens be caught cutting ditch across them chances are all against his ever having another opportunity cut ditch pray observe some effects this ditching business once there was neck opposite port hudson louisiana which was only half mile across its narrowest place you could walk across there fifteen minutes but if you made journey around cape on raft you traveled thirty five miles accomplish same thing 1722 river darted through that neck deserted its old bed thus shortened itself thirty five miles same way it shortened itself twenty five miles at black hawk point 1699 below red river landing raccourci cut off was made forty or fifty years ago i think this shortened river twenty eight miles our day if you travel by river from southernmost these three cut offs northernmost you go only seventy miles do same thing hundred seventy six years ago one had go hundred fifty eight miles shortening eighty eight miles that trifling distance at some forgotten time past cut offs were made above vidalia louisiana at island 92 at island 84 at hale s point these shortened river aggregate seventy seven miles since my own day on mississippi cut offs have been made at hurricane island at island 100 at napoleon arkansas at walnut bend at council bend these shortened river aggregate sixty seven miles my own time cut off was made at american bend which shortened river ten miles or more therefore mississippi between cairo new orleans was twelve hundred fifteen miles long one hundred seventy six years ago it was eleven hundred eighty after cut off 1722 it was one thousand forty after american bend cut off it has lost sixty seven miles since consequently its length is only nine hundred seventy three miles at present now if i wanted be one those ponderous scientific people let on prove what had occurred remote past by what had occurred given time recent past or what will occur far future by what has occurred late years what opportunity is here geology never had such chance nor such exact data argue from nor development species either glacial epochs are great things but they are vague vague please observe space one hundred seventy six years lower mississippi has shortened itself two hundred forty two miles that is average trifle over one mile third per year therefore any calm person who is not blind or idiotic can see that old oolitic silurian period just million years ago next november lower mississippi river was upwards one million three hundred thousand miles long stuck out over gulf mexico like fishing rod by same token any person can see that seven hundred forty two years from now lower mississippi will be only mile three quarters long cairo new orleans will have joined their streets together be plodding comfortably along under single mayor mutual board aldermen there is something fascinating about science one gets such wholesale returns conjecture out such trifling investment fact when water begins flow through one those ditches i have been speaking it is time for people thereabouts move water cleaves banks away like knife by time ditch has become twelve or fifteen feet wide calamity is as good as accomplished for no power on earth can stop it now when width has reached hundred yards banks begin peel off slices half acre wide current flowing around bend traveled formerly only five miles hour now it is tremendously increased by shortening distance i was on board first boat that tried go through cut off at american bend but we did not get through it was toward midnight wild night it was thunder lightning torrents rain it was estimated that current cut off was making about fifteen or twenty miles hour twelve or thirteen was best our boat could do even tolerably slack water therefore perhaps we were foolish try cut off however mr brown was ambitious he kept on trying eddy running up bank under point was about as swift as current out middle so we would go flying up shore like lightning express train get on big head steam stand by for surge when we struck current that was whirling by point but all our preparations were useless instant current hit us it spun us around like top water deluged forecastle boat careened so far over that one could hardly keep his feet next instant we were away down river clawing with might main keep out woods we tried experiment four times i stood on forecastle companion way see it was astonishing observe how suddenly boat would spin around turn tail moment she emerged from eddy current struck her nose sounding concussion quivering would have been about same if she had come full speed against sand bank under lightning flashes one could see plantation cabins goodly acres tumble into river crash they made was not bad effort at thunder once when we spun around we only missed house about twenty feet that had light burning window same instant that house went overboard nobody could stay on our forecastle water swept across it torrent every time we plunged athwart current at end our fourth effort we brought up woods two miles below cut off all country there was overflowed course day or two later cut off was three quarters mile wide boats passed up through it without much difficulty so saved ten miles old raccourci cut off reduced river s length twenty eight miles there used be tradition connected with it it was said that boat came along there night went around enormous elbow usual way pilots not knowing that cut off had been made it was grisly hideous night all shapes were vague distorted old bend had already begun fill up boat got running away from mysterious reefs occasionally hitting one perplexed pilots fell swearing finally uttered entirely unnecessary wish that they might never get out that place as always happens such cases that particular prayer was answered others neglected so this day that phantom steamer is still butting around that deserted river trying find her way out more than one grave watchman has sworn me that on drizzly dismal nights he has glanced fearfully down that forgotten river as he passed head island seen faint glow specter steamer s lights drifting through distant gloom heard muffled cough her scape pipes plaintive cry her leadsmen absence further statistics i beg close this chapter with one more reminiscence stephen most captains pilots held stephen s note for borrowed sums ranging from two hundred fifty dollars upward stephen never paid one these notes but he was very prompt very zealous about renewing them every twelve months course there came time at last when stephen could no longer borrow his ancient creditors so he was obliged lie wait for new men who did not know him such victim was good hearted simple natured young yates i use fictitious name but real name began as this one does with y young yates graduated as pilot got berth when month was ended he stepped up clerk s office received his two hundred fifty dollars crisp new bills stephen was there his silvery tongue began wag very little while yates s two hundred fifty dollars had changed hands fact was soon known at pilot headquarters amusement satisfaction old creditors were large generous but innocent yates never suspected that stephen s promise pay promptly at end week was worthless one yates called for his money at stipulated time stephen sweetened him up put him off week he called then according agreement came away sugar coated again but suffering under another postponement so thing went on yates haunted stephen week after week no purpose at last gave it up then straightway stephen began haunt yates wherever yates appeared there was inevitable stephen not only there but beaming with affection gushing with apologies for not being able pay by by whenever poor yates saw him coming he would turn fly drag his company with him if he had company but it was no use his debtor would run him down corner him panting red faced stephen would come with outstretched hands eager eyes invade conversation shake both yates s arms loose their sockets begin my what race i ve had i saw you didn t see me so i clapped on all steam for fear i d miss you entirely here you are there just stand so let me look at you just same old noble countenance yates s friend just look at him look at him ain t it just good look at him ain t it now ain t he just picture some call him picture i call him panorama that s what he is entire panorama now i m reminded how i do wish i could have seen you hour earlier for twenty four hours i ve been saving up that two hundred fifty dollars for you been looking for you everywhere i waited at planter s from six yesterday evening till two o clock this morning without rest or food my wife says where have you been all night i said this debt lies heavy on my mind she says all my days i never saw man take debt heart way you do i said it s my nature how can i change it she says well do go bed get some rest i said not till that poor noble young man has got his money so i set up all night this morning out i shot first man i struck told me you had shipped on grand turk gone new orleans well sir i had lean up against building cry so help me goodness i couldn t help it man that owned place come out cleaning up with rag said he didn t like have people cry against his building then it seemed me that whole world had turned against me it wasn t any use live any more coming along hour ago suffering no man knows what agony i met jim wilson paid him two hundred fifty dollars on account think that here you are now i haven t got cent but as sure as i am standing here on this ground on this particular brick there i ve scratched mark on brick remember it by i ll borrow that money pay it over you at twelve o clock sharp tomorrow now stand so let me look at you just once more so on yates s life became burden him he could not escape his debtor his debtor s awful sufferings on account not being able pay he dreaded show himself street lest he should find stephen lying wait for him at corner bogart s billiard saloon was great resort for pilots those days they met there about as much exchange river news as play one morning yates was there stephen was there too but kept out sight but by by when about all pilots had arrived who were town stephen suddenly appeared midst rushed for yates as for long lost brother oh i am so glad see you oh my soul sight you is such comfort my eyes gentlemen i owe all you money among you i owe probably forty thousand dollars i want pay it i intend pay it every last cent it you all know without my telling you what sorrow it has cost me remain so long under such deep obligations such patient generous friends but sharpest pang i suffer by far sharpest is from debt i owe this noble young man here i have come this place this morning especially make announcement that i have at last found method whereby i can pay off all my debts most especially i wanted him be here when i announced it yes my faithful friend my benefactor i ve found method i ve found method pay off all my debts you ll get your money hope dawned yates s eye then stephen beaming benignantly placing his hand upon yates s head added i am going pay them off alphabetical order then he turned disappeared full significance stephen s method did not dawn upon perplexed musing crowd for some two minutes then yates murmured with sigh well y s stand gaudy chance he won t get any further than c s this world i reckon that after good deal eternity has wasted away next one i ll still be referred up there as that poor ragged pilot that came here from st louis early days chapter 18 i take few extra lessons during two or two half years my apprenticeship i served under many pilots had experience many kinds steamboatmen many varieties steamboats for it was not always convenient for mr bixby have me with him such cases he sent me with somebody else i am this day profiting somewhat by that experience for that brief sharp schooling i got personally familiarly acquainted with about all different types human nature that are be found fiction biography or history fact is daily borne upon me that average shore employment requires as much as forty years equip man with this sort education when i say i am still profiting by this thing i do not mean that it has constituted me judge men no it has not done that for judges men are born not made my profit is various kind degree but feature it which i value most is zest which that early experience has given my later reading when i find well drawn character fiction or biography i generally take warm personal interest him for reason that i have known him before met him on river figure that comes before me oftenest out shadows that vanished time is that brown steamer pennsylvania man referred former chapter whose memory was so good tiresome he was middle aged long slim bony smooth shaven horse faced ignorant stingy malicious snarling fault hunting mote magnifying tyrant i early got habit coming on watch with dread at my heart no matter how good time i might have been having with off watch below no matter how high my spirits might be when i started aloft my soul became lead my body moment i approached pilot house i still remember first time i ever entered presence that man boat had backed out from st louis was straightening down i ascended pilot house high feather very proud be semi officially member executive family so fast famous boat brown was at wheel i paused middle room all fixed make my bow but brown did not look around i thought he took furtive glance at me out corner his eye but as not even this notice was repeated i judged i had been mistaken by this time he was picking his way among some dangerous breaks abreast woodyards therefore it would not be proper interrupt him so i stepped softly high bench took seat there was silence for ten minutes then my new boss turned inspected me deliberately painstakingly from head heel for about as it seemed me quarter hour after which he removed his countenance i saw it no more for some seconds then it came around once more this question greeted me are you horace bigsby s cub yes sir after this there was pause another inspection then what s your name i told him he repeated it after me it was probably only thing he ever forgot for although i was with him many months he never addressed himself me any other way than here then his command followed where was you born florida missouri pause then dern sight better staid there by means dozen or so pretty direct questions he pumped my family history out me leads were going now first crossing this interrupted inquest when leads had been laid he resumed how long you been on river i told him after pause where d you get them shoes i gave him information hold up your foot i did so he stepped back examined shoe minutely contemptuously scratching his head thoughtfully tilting his high sugar loaf hat well forward facilitate operation then ejaculated well i ll be dod derned returned his wheel what occasion there was be dod derned about it is thing which is still as much mystery me now as it was then it must have been all fifteen minutes fifteen minutes dull homesick silence before that long horse face swung round upon me again then what change it was as red as fire every muscle it was working now came this shriek here you going set there all day i lit middle floor shot there by electric suddenness surprise as soon as i could get my voice i said apologetically i have had no orders sir you ve had no orders my what fine bird we are we must have orders our father was gentleman owned slaves we ve been school yes we are gentleman too got have orders orders is it orders is what you want dod dern my skin i ll learn you swell yourself up blow around here about your dod derned orders g way from wheel i had approached it without knowing it i moved back step or two stood as dream all my senses stupefied by this frantic assault what you standing there for take that ice pitcher down texas tender come move along don t you be all day about it moment i got back pilot house brown said here what was you doing down there all this time i couldn t find texas tender i had go all way pantry derned likely story fill up stove i proceeded do so he watched me like cat presently he shouted put down that shovel deadest numskull i ever saw ain t even got sense enough load up stove all through watch this sort thing went on yes subsequent watches were much like it during stretch months as i have said i soon got habit coming on duty with dread moment i was presence even darkest night i could feel those yellow eyes upon me knew their owner was watching for pretext spit out some venom on me preliminarily he would say here take wheel two minutes later where nation you going pull her down pull her down after another moment say you going hold her all day let her go meet her meet her then he would jump from bench snatch wheel from me meet her himself pouring out wrath upon me all time george ritchie was other pilot s cub he was having good times now for his boss george ealer was as kindhearted as brown wasn t ritchie had steeled for brown season before consequently he knew exactly how entertain himself plague me all by one operation whenever i took wheel for moment on ealer s watch ritchie would sit back on bench play brown with continual ejaculations snatch her snatch her derndest mud cat i ever saw here where you going now going run over that snag pull her down don t you hear me pull her down there she goes just as i expected i told you not cramp that reef g way from wheel so i always had rough time it no matter whose watch it was sometimes it seemed me that ritchie s good natured badgering was pretty nearly as aggravating as brown s dead earnest nagging i often wanted kill brown but this would not answer cub had take everything his boss gave way vigorous comment criticism we all believed that there was united states law making it penitentiary offense strike or threaten pilot who was on duty however i could imagine myself killing brown there was no law against that that was thing i used always do moment i was abed instead going over my river my mind as was my duty i threw business aside for pleasure killed brown i killed brown every night for months not old stale commonplace ways but new picturesque ones ways that were sometimes surprising for freshness design ghastliness situation environment brown was always watching for pretext find fault if he could find no plausible pretext he would invent one he would scold you for shaving shore for not shaving it for hugging bar for not hugging it for pulling down when not invited for not pulling down when not invited for firing up without orders for waiting for orders word it was his invariable rule find fault with everything you did another invariable rule his was throw all his remarks you into form insult one day we were approaching new madrid bound down heavily laden brown was at one side wheel steering i was at other standing by pull down or shove up he cast furtive glance at me every now then i had long ago learned what that meant viz he was trying invent trap for me i wondered what shape it was going take by by he stepped back from wheel said his usual snarly way here see if you ve got gumption enough round her this was simply bound be success nothing could prevent it for he had never allowed me round boat before consequently no matter how i might do thing he could find free fault with it he stood back there with his greedy eye on me result was what might have been foreseen i lost my head quarter minute didn t know what i was about i started too early bring boat around but detected green gleam joy brown s eye corrected my mistake i started around once more while too high up but corrected myself again time i made other false moves still managed save myself but at last i grew so confused anxious that i tumbled into very worst blunder all i got too far down before beginning fetch boat around brown s chance was come his face turned red with passion he made one bound hurled me across house with sweep his arm spun wheel down began pour out stream vituperation upon me which lasted till he was out breath course this speech he called me all different kinds hard names he could think once or twice i thought he was even going swear but he didn t this time dod dern was nearest he ventured luxury swearing for he had been brought up with wholesome respect for future fire brimstone that was uncomfortable hour for there was big audience on hurricane deck when i went bed that night i killed brown seventeen different ways all them new chapter 19 brown i exchange compliments two trips later i got into serious trouble brown was steering i was pulling down my younger brother appeared on hurricane deck shouted brown stop at some landing or other mile or so below brown gave no intimation that he had heard anything but that was his way he never condescended take notice under clerk wind was blowing brown was deaf although he always pretended he wasn t i very much doubted if he had heard order if i had two heads i would have spoken but as i had only one it seemed judicious take care it so i kept still presently sure enough we went sailing by that plantation captain klinefelter appeared on deck said let her come around sir let her come around didn t henry tell you land here no sir i sent him up do it he did come up that s all good it done dod derned fool he never said anything didn t you hear him asked captain me course i didn t want be mixed up this business but there was no way avoid it so i said yes sir i knew what brown s next remark would be before he uttered it it was shut your mouth you never heard anything kind i closed my mouth according instructions hour later henry entered pilot house unaware what had been going on he was thoroughly inoffensive boy i was sorry see him come for i knew brown would have no pity on him brown began straightway here why didn t you tell me we d got land at that plantation i did tell you mr brown it s lie i said you lie yourself he did tell you brown glared at me unaffected surprise for as much as moment he was entirely speechless then he shouted me i ll attend your case half minute then henry you leave pilot house out with you it was pilot law must be obeyed boy started out even had his foot on upper step outside door when brown with sudden access fury picked up ten pound lump coal sprang after him but i was between with heavy stool i hit brown good honest blow which stretched him out i had committed crime crimes i had lifted my hand against pilot on duty i supposed i was booked for penitentiary sure couldn t be booked any surer if i went on squared my long account with this person while i had chance consequently i stuck him pounded him with my fists considerable time i do not know how long pleasure it probably made it seem longer than it really was but end he struggled free jumped up sprang wheel very natural solicitude for all this time here was this steamboat tearing down river at rate fifteen miles hour nobody at helm however eagle bend was two miles wide at this bank full stage correspondingly long deep boat was steering herself straight down middle taking no chances still that was only luck body might have found her charging into woods perceiving at glance that pennsylvania was no danger brown gathered up big spy glass war club fashion ordered me out pilot house with more than comanche bluster but i was not afraid him now so instead going i tarried criticized his grammar i reformed his ferocious speeches for him put them into good english calling his attention advantage pure english over bastard dialect pennsylvanian collieries whence he was extracted he could have done his part admiration cross fire mere vituperation course but he was not equipped for this species controversy so he presently laid aside his glass took wheel muttering shaking his head i retired bench racket had brought everybody hurricane deck i trembled when i saw old captain looking up from midst crowd i said myself now i am done for for although as rule he was so fatherly indulgent toward boat s family so patient minor shortcomings he could be stern enough when fault was worth it i tried imagine what he would do cub pilot who had been guilty such crime as mine committed on boat guard deep with costly freight alive with passengers our watch was nearly ended i thought i would go hide somewhere till i got chance slide ashore so i slipped out pilot house down steps around texas door was act gliding within when captain confronted me i dropped my head he stood over me silence moment or two then said impressively follow me i dropped into his wake he led way his parlor forward end texas we were alone now he closed after door then moved slowly forward one closed that he sat down i stood before him he looked at me some little time then said so you have been fighting mr brown i answered meekly yes sir do you know that that is very serious matter yes sir are you aware that this boat was plowing down river fully five minutes with no one at wheel yes sir did you strike him first yes sir what with stool sir hard middling sir did it knock him down he he fell sir did you follow it up did you do anything further yes sir what did you do pounded him sir pounded him yes sir did you pound him much that is severely one might call it that sir maybe i m deuced glad it hark ye never mention that i said that you have been guilty great crime don t you ever be guilty it again on this boat but lay for him ashore give him good sound thrashing do you hear i ll pay expenses now go mind you not word this anybody clear out with you you ve been guilty great crime you whelp i slid out happy with sense close shave mighty deliverance i heard him laughing himself slapping his fat thighs after i had closed his door when brown came off watch he went straight captain who was talking with some passengers on boiler deck demanded that i be put ashore new orleans added i ll never turn wheel on this boat again while that cub stays captain said but he needn t come round when you are on watch mr brown i won t even stay on same boat with him one us has got go ashore very well said captain let it be yourself resumed his talk with passengers during brief remainder trip i knew how emancipated slave feels for i was emancipated slave myself while we lay at landings i listened george ealer s flute or his readings from his two bibles that is say goldsmith shakespeare or i played chess with him would have beaten him sometimes only he always took back his last move ran game out differently chapter 20 catastrophe we lay three days new orleans but captain did not succeed finding another pilot so he proposed that i should stand daylight watch leave night watches george ealer but i was afraid i had never stood watch any sort by myself i believed i should be sure get into trouble head some chute or ground boat near cut through some bar or other brown remained his place but he would not travel with me so captain gave me order on captain t lacey for passage st louis said he would find new pilot there my steersman s berth could then be resumed lacey was leave couple days after pennsylvania night before pennsylvania left henry i sat chatting on freight pile on levee till midnight subject chat mainly was one which i think we had not exploited before steamboat disasters one was then on its way us little as we suspected it water which was make steam which should cause it was washing past some point fifteen hundred miles up river while we talked but it would arrive at right time right place we doubted if persons not clothed with authority were much use cases disaster attendant panic still they might be some use so we decided that if disaster ever fell within our experience we would at least stick boat give such minor service as chance might throw way henry remembered this afterward when disaster came acted accordingly lacey started up river two days behind pennsylvania we touched at greenville mississippi couple days out somebody shouted pennsylvania is blown up at ship island hundred fifty lives lost at napoleon arkansas same evening we got extra issued by memphis paper which gave some particulars it mentioned my brother said he was not hurt further up river we got later extra my brother was again mentioned but this time as being hurt beyond help we did not get full details catastrophe until we reached memphis this is sorrowful story it was six o clock on hot summer morning pennsylvania was creeping along north ship island about sixty miles below memphis on half head steam towing wood flat which was fast being emptied george ealer was pilot house alone i think second engineer striker had watch engine room second mate had watch on deck george black mr wood my brother clerks were asleep as were also brown head engineer carpenter chief mate one striker captain klinefelter was barber s chair barber was preparing shave him there were good many cabin passengers aboard three or four hundred deck passengers so it was said at time not very many them were astir wood being nearly all out flat now ealer rang come ahead full steam next moment four eight boilers exploded with thunderous crash whole forward third boat was hoisted toward sky main part mass with chimneys dropped upon boat again mountain riddled chaotic rubbish then after little fire broke out many people were flung considerable distances fell river among these were mr wood my brother carpenter carpenter was still stretched upon his mattress when he struck water seventy five feet from boat brown pilot george black chief clerk were never seen or heard after explosion barber s chair with captain klinefelter it unhurt was left with its back overhanging vacancy everything forward it floor all had disappeared stupefied barber who was also unhurt stood with one toe projecting over space still stirring his lather unconsciously saying not word when george ealer saw chimneys plunging aloft front him he knew what matter was so he muffled his face lapels his coat pressed both hands there tightly keep this protection its place so that no steam could get his nose or mouth he had ample time attend these details while he was going up returning he presently landed on top unexploded boilers forty feet below former pilot house accompanied by his wheel rain other stuff enveloped cloud scalding steam all many who breathed that steam died none escaped but ealer breathed none it he made his way free air as quickly as he could when steam cleared away he returned climbed up on boilers again patiently hunted out each every one his chessmen several joints his flute by this time fire was beginning threaten shrieks groans filled air great many persons had been scalded great many crippled explosion had driven iron crowbar through one man s body i think they said he was priest he did not die at once his sufferings were very dreadful young french naval cadet fifteen son french admiral was fearfully scalded but bore his tortures manfully both mates were badly scalded but they stood their posts nevertheless they drew wood boat aft they captain fought back frantic herd frightened immigrants till wounded could be brought there placed safety first when mr wood henry fell water they struck out for shore which was only few hundred yards away but henry presently said he believed he was not hurt what unaccountable error therefore would swim back boat help save wounded so they parted henry returned by this time fire was making fierce headway several persons who were imprisoned under ruins were begging piteously for help all efforts conquer fire proved fruitless so buckets were presently thrown aside officers fell with axes tried cut prisoners out striker was one captives he said he was not injured but could not free himself when he saw that fire was likely drive away workers he begged that some one would shoot him thus save him from more dreadful death fire did drive axmen away they had listen helpless this poor fellow s supplications till flames ended his miseries fire drove all into wood flat that could be accommodated there it was cut adrift then it burning steamer floated down river toward ship island they moored flat at head island there unsheltered from blazing sun half naked occupants had remain without food or stimulants or help for their hurts during rest day steamer came along finally carried unfortunates memphis there most lavish assistance was at once forthcoming by this time henry was insensible physicians examined his injuries saw that they were fatal naturally turned their main attention patients who could be saved forty wounded were placed upon pallets on floor great public hall among these was henry there ladies memphis came every day with flowers fruits dainties delicacies all kinds there they remained nursed wounded all physicians stood watches there all medical students rest town furnished money or whatever else was wanted memphis knew how do all these things well for many disaster like pennsylvania s had happened near her doors she was experienced above all other cities on river gracious office good samaritan sight i saw when i entered that large hall was new strange me two long rows prostrate forms more than forty all every face head shapeless wad loose raw cotton it was gruesome spectacle i watched there six days nights very melancholy experience it was there was one daily incident which was peculiarly depressing this was removal doomed chamber apart it was done order that morale other patients might not be injuriously affected by seeing one their number death agony fated one was always carried out with as little stir as possible stretcher was always hidden from sight by wall assistants but no matter everybody knew what that cluster bent forms with its muffled step its slow movement meant all eyes watched it wistfully shudder went abreast it like wave i saw many poor fellows removed death room saw them no more afterward but i saw our chief mate carried thither more than once his hurts were frightful especially his scalds he was clothed linseed oil raw cotton his waist resembled nothing human he was often out his mind then his pains would make him rave shout sometimes shriek then after period dumb exhaustion his disordered imagination would suddenly transform great apartment into forecastle hurrying throng nurses into crew he would come sitting posture shout hump yourselves hump yourselves you petrifactions snail bellies pall bearers going be all day getting that hatful freight out supplement this explosion with firmament obliterating irruption or profanity which nothing could stay or stop till his crater was empty now then while these frenzies possessed him he would tear off handfuls cotton expose his cooked flesh view it was horrible it was bad for others course this noise these exhibitions so doctors tried give him morphine quiet him but his mind or out it he would not take it he said his wife had been killed by that treacherous drug he would die before he would take it he suspected that doctors were concealing it his ordinary medicines his water so he ceased from putting either his lips once when he had been without water during two sweltering days he took dipper his hand sight limpid fluid misery his thirst tempted him almost beyond his strength but he mastered himself threw it away after that he allowed no more be brought near him three times i saw him carried death room insensible supposed be dying but each time he revived cursed his attendants demanded be taken back he lived be mate steamboat again but he was only one who went death room returned alive dr peyton principal physician rich all attributes that go constitute high flawless character did all that educated judgment trained skill could do for henry but as newspapers had said beginning his hurts were past help on evening sixth day his wandering mind busied itself with matters far away his nerveless fingers picked at his coverlet his hour had struck we bore him death room poor boy chapter 21 section my biography due course i got my license i was pilot now full fledged i dropped into casual employments no misfortunes resulting intermittent work gave place steady protracted engagements time

slow drifting years that have come gone since i last looked from windows pilot house let us resume now chapter 22 i return my muttons after twenty one years absence i felt very strong desire see river again steamboats such boys as might be left so i resolved go out there i enlisted poet for company stenographer take him down started westward about middle april as i proposed make notes with view printing i took some thought as methods procedure i reflected that if i were recognized on river i should not be as free go come talk inquire spy around as i should be if unknown i remembered that it was custom steamboatmen old times load up confiding stranger with most picturesque admirable lies put sophisticated friend off with dull ineffectual facts so i concluded that from business point view it would be advantage disguise our party with fictitious names idea was certainly good but it bred infinite bother for although smith jones johnson are easy names remember when there is no occasion remember them it is next impossible recollect them when they are wanted how do criminals manage keep brand new alias mind this is great mystery i was innocent yet was seldom able lay my hand on my new name when it was needed it seemed me that if i had had crime on my conscience further confuse me i could never have kept name by me at all we left per pennsylvania railroad at 8 m april 18 evening speaking dress grace picturesqueness drop gradually out it as one travels away from new york i find that among my notes it makes no difference which direction you take fact remains same whether you move north south east or west no matter you can get up morning guess how far you have come by noting what degree grace picturesqueness is by that time lacking costumes new passengers i do not mean women alone but both sexes it may be that carriage is at bottom this thing i think it is for there are plenty ladies gentlemen provincial cities whose garments are all made by best tailors dressmakers new york yet this has no perceptible effect upon grand fact educated eye never mistakes those people for new yorkers no there is godless grace snap style about born bred new yorker which mere clothing cannot effect april 19 this morning struck into region full goatees sometimes accompanied by mustache but only occasionally it was odd come upon this thick crop obsolete uncomely fashion it was like running suddenly across forgotten acquaintance whom you had supposed dead for generation goatee extends over wide extent country is accompanied by iron clad belief adam biblical history creation which has not suffered from assaults scientists afternoon at railway stations loafers carry both hands their breeches pockets it was observable heretofore that one hand was sometimes out doors here never this is important fact geography if loafers determined character country it would be still more important course heretofore all along station loafer has been often observed scratch one shin with other foot here these remains activity are wanting this has ominous look by by we entered tobacco chewing region fifty years ago tobacco chewing region covered union it is greatly restricted now next boots began appear not strong force however later away down mississippi they became rule they disappeared from other sections union with mud no doubt they will disappear from river villages also when proper pavements come we reached st louis at ten o clock at night at counter hotel i tendered hurriedly invented fictitious name with miserable attempt at careless ease clerk paused inspected me compassionate way which one inspects respectable person who is found doubtful circumstances then he said it s all right i know what sort room you want used clerk at st james new york unpromising beginning for fraudulent career we started supper room met two other men whom i had known elsewhere how odd unfair it is wicked impostors go around lecturing under my nom de guerre nobody suspects them but when honest man attempts imposture he is exposed at once one thing seemed plain we must start down river next day if people who could not be deceived were going crop up at this rate unpalatable disappointment for we had hoped have week st louis southern was good hotel we could have had comfortable time there it is large well conducted its decorations do not make one cry as do those vast palmer house chicago true billiard tables were old silurian period cues balls post pliocene but there was refreshment this not discomfort for there is rest healing contemplation antiquities most notable absence observable billiard room was absence river man if he was there he had taken his sign he was disguise i saw there none swell airs graces ostentatious displays money pompous squanderings it which used distinguish steamboat crowd from dry land crowd bygone days thronged billiard rooms st louis those times principal saloons were always populous with river men given fifty players present thirty or thirty five were likely be from river but i suspected that ranks were thin now steamboatmen no longer aristocracy why my time they used call barkeep bill or joe or tom slap him on shoulder i watched for that but none these people did it manifestly glory that once was had dissolved vanished away these twenty one years when i went up my room i found there young man called rogers crying rogers was not his name neither was jones brown dexter ferguson bascom nor thompson but he answered either these that body found handy emergency or any other name fact if he perceived that you meant him he said what is person do here when he wants drink water drink this slush can t you drink it i could if i had some other water wash it with here was thing which had not changed score years had not affected this water s mulatto complexion least score centuries would succeed no better perhaps it comes out turbulent bank caving missouri every tumblerful it holds nearly acre land solution i got this fact from bishop diocese if you will let your glass stand half hour you can separate land from water as easy as genesis then you will find them both good one good eat other good drink land is very nourishing water is thoroughly wholesome one appeases hunger other thirst but natives do not take them separately but together as nature mixed them when they find inch mud bottom glass they stir it up then take draught as they would gruel it is difficult for stranger get used this batter but once used it he will prefer it water this is really case it is good for steamboating good drink but it is worthless for all other purposes except baptizing next morning we drove around town rain city seemed but little changed it was greatly changed but it did not seem so because st louis as london pittsburgh you can t persuade new thing look new coal smoke turns it into antiquity moment you take your hand off it place had just about doubled its size since i was resident it was now become city 400 000 inhabitants still solid business parts it looked about as it had looked formerly yet i am sure there is not as much smoke st louis now as there used be smoke used bank itself dense billowy black canopy over town hide sky from view this shelter is very much thinner now still there is sufficiency smoke there i think i heard no complaint however on outskirts changes were apparent enough notably dwelling house architecture fine new homes are noble beautiful modern they stand by themselves too with green lawns around them whereas dwellings former day are packed together blocks are all one pattern with windows all alike set arched frame work twisted stone sort house which was handsome enough when it was rarer there was another change forest park this was new me it is beautiful very extensive has excellent merit having been made mainly by nature there are other parks fine ones notably tower grove botanical gardens for st louis interested herself such improvements at earlier day than did most our cities first time i ever saw st louis i could have bought it for six million dollars it was mistake my life that i did not do it it was bitter now look abroad over this domed steepled metropolis this solid expanse bricks mortar stretching away on every hand into dim measure defying distances remember that i had allowed that opportunity go by why i should have allowed it go by seems course foolish inexplicable day at first glance yet there were reasons at time justify this course scotchman hon charles augustus murray writing some forty five or fifty years ago said streets are narrow ill paved ill lighted those streets are narrow still course many them are ill paved yet but reproach ill lighting cannot be repeated now catholic new church was only notable building then mr murray was confidently called upon admire it with its species grecian portico surmounted by kind steeple much too diminutive its proportions surmounted by sundry ornaments which unimaginative scotchman found himself quite unable describe therefore was grateful when german tourist helped him out with exclamation by they look exactly like bed posts st louis is well equipped with stately noble public buildings now little church which people used be so proud lost its importance long time ago still this would not surprise mr murray if he could come back for he prophesied coming greatness st louis with strong confidence further we drove our inspection tour more sensibly i realized how city had grown since i had seen it last changes detail became steadily more apparent frequent than at first too changes uniformly evidencing progress energy prosperity but change changes was on levee this time departure from rule half dozen sound asleep steamboats where i used see solid mile wide awake ones this was melancholy this was woeful absence pervading jocund steamboatman from billiard saloon was explained he was absent because he is no more his occupation is gone his power has passed away he is absorbed into common herd he grinds at mill shorn samson inconspicuous half dozen lifeless steamboats mile empty wharves negro fatigued with whiskey stretched asleep wide soundless vacancy where serried hosts commerce used contend footnote capt marryat writing forty five years ago says st louis has 20 000 inhabitants river abreast town is crowded with steamboats lying two or three tiers here was desolation indeed old old sea as one tears comes murmuring with foamy lips knocking at vacant piers calls for his long lost multitude ships towboat railroad had done their work done it well completely mighty bridge stretching along over our heads had done its share slaughter spoliation remains former steamboatmen told me with wan satisfaction that bridge doesn t pay still it can be no sufficient compensation corpse know that dynamite that laid him out was not as good quality as it had been supposed be pavements along river front were bad sidewalks were rather out repair there was rich abundance mud all this was familiar satisfying but ancient armies drays struggling throngs men mountains freight were gone sabbath reigned their stead immemorial mile cheap foul doggeries remained but business was dull with them multitudes poison swilling irishmen had departed their places were few scattering handfuls ragged negroes some drinking some drunk some nodding others asleep st louis is great prosperous advancing city but river edge it seems dead past resurrection mississippi steamboating was born about 1812 at end thirty years it had grown mighty proportions less than thirty more it was dead strangely short life for so majestic creature course it is not absolutely dead neither is crippled octogenarian who could once jump twenty two feet on level ground but as contrasted with what it was its prime vigor mississippi steamboating may be called dead it killed old fashioned keel boating by reducing freight trip new orleans less than week railroads have killed steamboat passenger traffic by doing two or three days what steamboats consumed week doing towing fleets have killed through freight traffic by dragging six or seven steamer loads stuff down river at time at expense so trivial that steamboat competition was out question freight passenger way traffic remains steamers this is hands along two thousand miles river between st paul new orleans two or three close corporations well fortified with capital by able thoroughly business like management system these make sufficiency money out what is left once prodigious steamboating industry i suppose that st louis new orleans have not suffered materially by change but alas for wood yard man he used fringe river all way his close ranked merchandise stretched from one city other along banks he sold uncountable cords it every year for cash on nail but all scattering boats that are left burn coal now seldomest spectacle on mississippi day is wood pile where now is once wood yard man chapter 23 traveling incognito my idea was tarry while every town between st louis new orleans do this it would be necessary go from place place by short packet lines it was easy plan make would have been easy one follow twenty years ago but not now there are wide intervals between boats these days i wanted begin with interesting old french settlements st genevieve kaskaskia sixty miles below st louis there was only one boat advertised for that section grand tower packet still one boat was enough so we went down look at her she was venerable rack heap fraud boot for she was playing herself for personal property whereas good honest dirt was so thickly caked all over her that she was righteously taxable as real estate there are places new england where her hurricane deck would be worth hundred fifty dollars acre soil on her forecastle was quite good new crop wheat was already springing from cracks protected places companionway was dry sandy character would have been well suited for grapes with southern exposure little subsoiling soil boiler deck was thin rocky but good enough for grazing purposes colored boy was on watch here nobody else visible we gathered from him that this calm craft would go as advertised if she got her trip if she didn t get it she would wait for it has she got any her trip bless you no boss she ain t unloadened yit she only come dis mawnin he was uncertain as when she might get her trip but thought it might be morrow or maybe next day this would not answer at all so we had give up novelty sailing down river on farm we had one more arrow our quiver vicksburg packet gold dust was leave at 5 p m we took passage her for memphis gave up idea stopping off here there as being impracticable she was neat clean comfortable we camped on boiler deck bought some cheap literature kill time with vender was venerable irishman with benevolent face tongue that worked easily socket from him we learned that he had lived st louis thirty four years had never been across river during that period then he wandered into very flowing lecture filled with classic names allusions which was quite wonderful for fluency until fact became rather apparent that this was not first time nor perhaps fiftieth that speech had been delivered he was good deal character much better company than sappy literature he was selling random remark connecting irishmen beer brought this nugget information out him they don t drink it sir they can t drink it sir give irishman lager for month he s dead man irishman is lined with copper beer corrodes it but whiskey polishes copper is saving him sir at eight o clock promptly we backed out crossed river as we crept toward shore thick darkness blinding glory white electric light burst suddenly from our forecastle lit up water warehouses as with noon day glare another big change this no more flickering smoky pitch dripping ineffectual torch baskets now their day is past next instead calling out score hands man stage couple men hatful steam lowered it from derrick where it was suspended launched it deposited it just right spot whole thing was over done with before mate olden time could have got his profanity mill adjusted begin preparatory services why this new simple method handling stages was not thought when first steamboat was built is mystery which helps one realize what dull witted slug average human being is we finally got away at two morning when i turned out at six we were rounding at rocky point where there was old stone warehouse at any rate ruins it two or three decayed dwelling houses were near by shelter leafy hills but there were no evidences human or other animal life be seen i wondered if i had forgotten river for i had no recollection whatever this place shape river too was unfamiliar there was nothing sight anywhere that i could remember ever having seen before i was surprised disappointed annoyed we put ashore well dressed lady gentleman two well dressed lady like young girls together with sundry russia leather bags strange place for such folk no carriage was waiting party moved off as if they had not expected any struck down winding country road afoot but mystery was explained when we got under way again for these people were evidently bound for large town which lay shut behind tow head i e new island couple miles below this landing i couldn t remember that town i couldn t place it couldn t call its name so i lost part my temper i suspected that it might be st genevieve so it proved be observe what this eccentric river had been about it had built up this huge useless tow head directly front this town cut off its river communications fenced it away completely made country town it it is fine old place too deserved better fate it was settled by french is relic time when one could travel from mouths mississippi quebec be on french territory under french rule all way presently i ascended hurricane deck cast longing glance toward pilot house chapter 24 my incognito is exploded after close study face pilot on watch i was satisfied that i had never seen him before so i went up there pilot inspected me i re inspected pilot these customary preliminaries over i sat down on high bench he faced about went on with his work every detail pilot house was familiar me with one exception large mouthed tube under breast board i puzzled over that thing considerable time then gave up asked what it was for hear engine bells through it was another good contrivance which ought have been invented half century sooner so i was thinking when pilot asked do you know what this rope is for i managed get around this question without committing myself is this first time you were ever pilot house i crept under that one where are you from new england first time you have ever been west i climbed over this one if you take interest such things i can tell you what all these things are for i said i should like it this putting his hand on backing bell rope is sound fire alarm this putting his hand on go ahead bell is call texas tender this one indicating whistle lever is call captain so he went on touching one object after another reeling off his tranquil spool lies i had never felt so like passenger before i thanked him with emotion for each new fact wrote it down my note book pilot warmed his opportunity proceeded load me up good old fashioned way at times i was afraid he was going rupture his invention but it always stood strain he pulled through all right he drifted by easy stages into revealments river s marvelous eccentricities one sort another backed them up with some pretty gigantic illustrations for instance do you see that little boulder sticking out water yonder well when i first came on river that was solid ridge rock over sixty feet high two miles long all washed away but that this with sigh i had mighty impulse destroy him but it seemed me that killing any ordinary way would be too good for him once when odd looking craft with vast coal scuttle slanting aloft on end beam was steaming by distance he indifferently drew attention it as one might object grown wearisome through familiarity observed that it was alligator boat alligator boat what s it for dredge out alligators with are they so thick as be troublesome well not now because government keeps them down but they used be not everywhere but favorite places here there where river is wide shoal like plum point stack island so on places they call alligator beds did they actually impede navigation years ago yes very low water there was hardly trip then that we didn t get aground on alligators it seemed me that i should certainly have get out my tomahawk however i restrained myself said it must have been dreadful yes it was one main difficulties about piloting it was so hard tell anything about water damned things shift around so never lie still five minutes at time you can tell wind reef straight off by look it you can tell break you can tell sand reef that s all easy but alligator reef doesn t show up worth anything nine times ten you can t tell where water is when you do see where it is like as not it ain t there when you get there devils have swapped around so meantime course there were some few pilots that could judge alligator water nearly as well as they could any other kind but they had have natural talent for it it wasn t thing body could learn you had be born with it let me see there was ben thornburg beck jolly squire bell horace bixby major downing john stevenson billy gordon jim brady george ealer billy youngblood all 1 alligator pilots they could tell alligator water as far as another christian could tell whiskey read it ah couldn t they though i only wish i had as many dollars as they could read alligator water mile half off yes it paid them do it too good alligator pilot could always get fifteen hundred dollars month nights other people had lay up for alligators but those fellows never laid up for alligators they never laid up for anything but fog they could smell best alligator water it was said i don t know whether it was so or not i think body s got his hands full enough if he sticks just what he knows himself without going around backing up other people s say so s though there s plenty that ain t backward about doing it as long as they can roust out something wonderful tell which is not style robert styles by as much as three fathom maybe quarter less my was this rob styles this mustached stately figure slim enough cub my time how he has improved comeliness five twenty year noble art inflating his facts after these musings i said aloud i should think that dredging out alligators wouldn t have done much good because they could come back again right away if you had had as much experience alligators as i have you wouldn t talk like that you dredge alligator once he s convinced it s last you hear him he wouldn t come back for pie if there s one thing that alligator is more down on than another it s being dredged besides they were not simply shoved out way most scoopful were scooped aboard they emptied them into hold when they had got trip they took them orleans government works what for why make soldier shoes out their hides all government shoes are made alligator hide it makes best shoes world they last five years they won t absorb water alligator fishery is government monopoly all alligators are government property just like live oaks you cut down live oak government fines you fifty dollars you kill alligator up you go for misprision treason lucky duck if they don t hang you too they will if you re democrat buzzard is sacred bird south you can t touch him alligator is sacred bird government you ve got let him alone do you ever get aground on alligators now oh no it hasn t happened for years well then why do they still keep alligator boats service just for police duty nothing more they merely go up down now then present generation alligators know them as easy as burglar knows roundsman when they see one coming they break camp go for woods after rounding out finishing up polishing off alligator business he dropped easily comfortably into historical vein told some tremendous feats half dozen old time steamboats his acquaintance dwelling at special length upon certain extraordinary performance his chief favorite among this distinguished fleet then adding that boat was cyclone last trip she ever made she sunk that very trip captain was tom ballou most immortal liar that ever i struck he couldn t ever seem tell truth any kind weather why he would make you fairly shudder he was most scandalous liar i left him finally i couldn t stand it proverb says like master like man if you stay with that kind man you ll come under suspicion by by just as sure as you live he paid first class wages but said i what s wages when your reputation s danger so i let wages go froze my reputation i ve never regretted it reputation s worth everything ain t it that s way i look at it he had more selfish organs than any seven men world all packed stern sheets his skull course where they belonged they weighed down back his head so that it made his nose tilt up air people thought it was vanity but it wasn t it was malice if you only saw his foot you d take him be nineteen feet high but he wasn t it was because his foot was out drawing he was intended be nineteen feet high no doubt if his foot was made first but he didn t get there he was only five feet ten that s what he was that s what he is you take lies out him he ll shrink size your hat you take malice out him he ll disappear that cyclone was rattler go sweetest thing steer that ever walked waters set her amidships big river just let her go it was all you had do she would hold herself on star all night if you let her alone you couldn t ever feel her rudder it wasn t any more labor steer her than it is count republican vote south carolina election one morning just at daybreak last trip she ever made they took her rudder aboard mend it i didn t know anything about it i backed her out from wood yard went weaving down river all serene when i had gone about twenty three miles made four horribly crooked crossings without any rudder yes old capt tom appeared on roof began find fault with me for running such dark night such dark night why you said never mind what i said twas as dark as egypt now though pretty soon moon began rise you mean sun because you started out just at break look here was this before you quitted captain on account his lying or it was before oh long time before as i was saying he but was this trip she sunk or was oh no months afterward so old man he then she made two last trips because you said he stepped back from wheel swabbing away his perspiration said here calling me by name you take her lie while you re handier at it than i am trying play yourself for stranger innocent why i knew you before you had spoken seven words i made up my mind find out what was your little game it was draw me out well i let you didn t i now take wheel finish watch next time play fair you won t have work your passage thus ended fictitious name business not six hours out from st louis but i had gained privilege any way for i had been itching get my hands on wheel from beginning i seemed have forgotten river but i hadn t forgotten how steer steamboat nor how enjoy it either chapter 25 from cairo hickman scenery from st louis cairo two hundred miles is varied beautiful hills were clothed fresh foliage spring now were gracious worthy setting for broad river flowing between our trip began auspiciously with perfect day as breeze sunshine our boat threw miles out behind her with satisfactory despatch we found railway intruding at chester illinois chester has also penitentiary now is otherwise marching on at grand tower too there was railway another at cape girardeau former town gets its name from huge squat pillar rock which stands up out water on missouri side river piece nature s fanciful handiwork is one most picturesque features scenery that region for nearer or remoter neighbors tower has devil s bake oven so called perhaps because it does not powerfully resemble anybody else s bake oven devil s tea table this latter great smooth surfaced mass rock with diminishing wine glass stem perched some fifty or sixty feet above river beside beflowered garlanded precipice sufficiently like tea table answer for anybody devil or christian away down river we have devil s elbow devil s race course lots other property his which i cannot now call mind town grand tower was evidently busier place than it had been old times but it seemed need some repairs here there new coat whitewash all over still it was pleasant me see old coat once more uncle mumford our second officer said place had been suffering from high water consequently was not looking its best now but he said it was not strange that it didn t waste white wash on itself for more lime was made there better quality than anywhere west added on dairy farm you never can get any milk for your coffee nor any sugar for it on sugar plantation it is against sense go lime town hunt for white wash my own experience i knew first two items be true also that people who sell candy don t care for candy therefore there was plausibility uncle mumford s final observation that people who make lime run more religion than whitewash uncle mumford said further that grand tower was great coaling center prospering place cape girardeau is situated on hillside makes handsome appearance there is great jesuit school for boys at foot town by river uncle mumford said it had as high reputation for thoroughness as any similar institution missouri there was another college higher up on airy summit bright new edifice picturesquely peculiarly towered pinnacled sort gigantic casters with cruets all complete uncle mumford said that cape girardeau was athens missouri contained several colleges besides those already mentioned all them on religious basis one kind or another he directed my attention what he called strong pervasive religious look town but i could not see that it looked more religious than other hill towns with same slope built same kind bricks partialities often make people see more than really exists uncle mumford has been thirty years mate on river he is man practical sense level head has observed has had much experience one sort another has opinions has also just perceptible dash poetry his composition easy gift speech thick growl his voice oath or two where he can get at them when exigencies his office require spiritual lift he is mate blessed old time kind goes gravely damning around when there is work fore way mellow ex steamboatman s heart with sweet soft longings for vanished days that shall come no more git up there you going be all day why d n t you say you was petrified your hind legs before you shipped he is steady man with his crew kind just but firm so they like him stay with him he is still slouchy garb old generation mates but next trip anchor line will have him uniform natty blue naval uniform with brass buttons along with all officers line then he will be totally different style scenery from what he is now uniforms on mississippi it beats all other changes put together for surprise still there is another surprise that it was not made fifty years ago it is so manifestly sensible that it might have been thought earlier one would suppose during fifty years out there innocent passenger need help information has been mistaking mate for cook captain for barber being roughly entertained for it too but his troubles are ended now greatly improved aspect boat s staff is another advantage achieved by dress reform period steered down bend below cape girardeau they used call it steersman s bend plain sailing plenty water it always about only place upper river that new cub was allowed take boat through low water thebes at head grand chain commerce at foot it were towns easily rememberable as they had not undergone conspicuous alteration nor chain either nature things for it is chain sunken rocks admirably arranged capture kill steamboats on bad nights good many steamboat corpses lie buried there out sight among rest my first friend paul jones she knocked her bottom out went down like pot so historian told me uncle mumford he said she had gray mare aboard preacher me this sufficiently accounted for disaster as it did course mumford who added but there are many ignorant people who would scoff at such matter call it superstition but you will always notice that they are people who have never traveled with gray mare preacher i went down river once such company we grounded at bloody island we grounded at hanging dog we grounded just below this same commerce we jolted beaver dam rock we hit one worst breaks graveyard behind goose island we had roustabout killed fight we burnt boiler broke shaft collapsed flue went into cairo with nine feet water hold may have been more may have been less i remember it as if it were yesterday men lost their heads with terror they painted mare blue sight town threw preacher overboard or we should not have arrived at all preacher was fished out saved he acknowledged himself that he had been blame i remember it all as if it were yesterday that this combination preacher gray mare should breed calamity seems strange at first glance unbelievable but fact is fortified by so much unassailable proof that doubt is dishonor reason i myself remember case where captain was warned by numerous friends against taking gray mare preacher with him but persisted his purpose spite all that could be said same day it may have been next some say it was though i think it was same day he got drunk fell down hatchway was borne his home corpse this is literally true no vestige hat island is left now every shred it is washed away i do not even remember what part river it used be except that it was between st louis cairo somewhere it was bad region all around about hat island early days farmer who lived on illinois shore there said that twenty nine steamboats had left their bones strung along within sight from his house between st louis cairo steamboat wrecks average one mile two hundred wrecks altogether i could recognize big changes from commerce down beaver dam rock was out middle river now throwing prodigious break it used be close shore boats went down outside it big island that used be away out mid river has retired missouri shore boats do not go near it any more island called jacket pattern is whittled down wedge now is booked for early destruction goose island is all gone but little dab size steamboat perilous graveyard among whose numberless wrecks we used pick our way so slowly gingerly is far away from channel now terror nobody one islands formerly called two sisters is gone entirely other which used lie close illinois shore is now on missouri side mile away it is joined solidly shore it takes sharp eye see where seam is but it is illinois ground yet people who live on it have ferry themselves over work illinois roads pay illinois taxes singular state things near mouth river several islands were missing washed away cairo was still there easily visible across long flat point upon whose further verge it stands but we had steam long way around get it night fell as we were going out upper river meeting floods ohio we dashed along without anxiety for hidden rock which used lie right way has moved up stream long distance out channel or rather about one county has gone into river from missouri point cairo point has made down added its long tongue territory correspondingly mississippi is just equitable river it never tumbles one man s farm overboard without building new farm just like it for that man s neighbor this keeps down hard feelings going into cairo we came near killing steamboat which paid no attention our whistle then tried cross our bows by doing some strong backing we saved him which was great loss for he would have made good literature cairo is brisk town now is substantially built has city look about it which is noticeable contrast its former estate as per mr dickens s portrait it however it was already building with bricks when i had seen it last which was when colonel now general grant was drilling his first command there uncle mumford says libraries sunday schools have done good work cairo as well as brick masons cairo has heavy railroad river trade her situation at junction two great rivers is so advantageous that she cannot well help prospering when i turned out morning we had passed columbus kentucky were approaching hickman pretty town perched on handsome hill hickman is rich tobacco region formerly enjoyed great lucrative trade that staple collecting it there her warehouses from large area country shipping it by boat but uncle mumford says she built railway facilitate this commerce little more he thinks it facilitated it wrong way took bulk trade out her hands by collaring it along line without gathering it at her doors chapter 26 under fire talk began run upon war now for we were getting down into upper edge former battle stretch by this time columbus was just behind us so there was good deal said about famous battle belmont several boat s officers had seen active service mississippi war fleet i gathered that they found themselves sadly out their element that kind business at first but afterward got accustomed it reconciled it more or less at home it one our pilots had his first war experience belmont fight as pilot on boat confederate service i had often had curiosity know how green hand might feel his maiden battle perched all solitary alone on high pilot house target for tom dick harry nobody at his elbow shame him from showing white feather when matters grew hot perilous around him so me his story was valuable it filled gap for me which all histories had left till that time empty pilot s first battle he said it was 7th november fight began at seven morning i was on r h w hill took over load troops from columbus came back took over battery artillery my partner said he was going see fight wanted me go along i said no i wasn t anxious i would look at it from pilot house he said i was coward left that fight was awful sight general cheatham made his men strip their coats off throw them pile said now follow me hell or victory i heard him say that from pilot house then he galloped at head his troops old general pillow with his white hair mounted on white horse sailed too leading his troops as lively as boy by by federals chased rebels back here they came tearing along everybody for himself devil take hindmost down under bank they scrambled took shelter i was sitting with my legs hanging out pilot house window all at once i noticed whizzing sound passing my ear judged it was bullet i didn t stop think about anything i just tilted over backwards landed on floor staid there balls came booming around three cannon balls went through chimney one ball took off corner pilot house shells were screaming bursting all around mighty warm times i wished i hadn t come i lay there on pilot house floor while shots came faster faster i crept behind big stove middle pilot house presently minie ball came through stove just grazed my head cut my hat i judged it was time go away from there captain was on roof with red headed major from memphis fine looking man i heard him say he wanted leave here but that pilot is killed i crept over starboard side pull bell set her back raised up took look i saw about fifteen shot holes through window panes had come so lively i hadn t noticed them i glanced out on water spattering shot were like hailstorm i thought best get out that place i went down pilot house guy head first not feet first but head first slid down before i struck deck captain said we must leave there so i climbed up guy got on floor again about that time they collared my partner were bringing him up pilot house between two soldiers somebody had said i was killed he put his head saw me on floor reaching for backing bells he said oh hell he ain t shot jerked away from men who had him by collar ran below we were there until three o clock afternoon then got away all right next time i saw my partner i said now come out be honest tell me truth where did you go when you went see that battle he says i went down hold all through that fight i was scared nearly death i hardly knew anything i was so frightened but you see nobody knew that but me next day general polk sent for me praised me for my bravery gallant conduct i never said anything i let it go at that i judged it wasn t so but it was not for me contradict general officer pretty soon after that i was sick used up had go off hot springs when there i got good many letters from commanders saying they wanted me come back i declined because i wasn t well enough or strong enough but i kept still kept reputation i had made plain story straightforwardly told but mumford told me that that pilot had gilded that scare his spots that his subsequent career war was proof it we struck down through chute island no 8 i went below fell into conversation with passenger handsome man with easy carriage intelligent face we were approaching island no 10 place so celebrated during war this gentleman s home was on main shore its neighborhood i had some talk with him about war times but presently discourse fell upon feuds for no part south has vendetta flourished more briskly or held out longer between warring families than this particular region this gentleman said there s been more than one feud around here old times but i reckon worst one was between darnells watsons nobody don t know now what first quarrel was about it s so long ago darnells watsons don t know if there s any them living which i don t think there is some says it was about horse or cow anyway it was little matter money it wasn t no consequence none world both families was rich thing could have been fixed up easy enough but no that wouldn t do rough words had been passed so nothing but blood could fix it up after that that horse or cow whichever it was cost sixty years killing crippling every year or so somebody was shot on one side or other as fast as one generation was laid out their sons took up feud kept it going it s just as i say they went on shooting each other year year out making kind religion it you see till they d done forgot long ago what it was all about wherever darnell caught watson or watson caught darnell one em was going get hurt only question was which them got drop on other they d shoot one another down right presence family they didn t hunt for each other but when they happened meet they puffed begun men would shoot boys boys would shoot men man shot boy twelve years old happened on him woods didn t give him no chance if he had given him chance boy d shot him both families belonged same church everybody around here is religious through all this fifty or sixty years fuss both tribes was there every sunday worship they lived each side line church was at landing called compromise half church half aisle was kentucky other half tennessee sundays you d see families drive up all their sunday clothes men women children file up aisle set down quiet orderly one lot on tennessee side church other on kentucky side men boys would lean their guns up against wall handy then all hands would join with prayer praise though they say man next aisle didn t kneel down along with rest family kind stood guard i don t know never was at that church my life but i remember that that s what used be said twenty or twenty five years ago one feud families caught young man nineteen out killed him don t remember whether it was darnells watsons or one other feuds but anyway this young man rode up steamboat laying there at time first thing he saw was whole gang enemy he jumped down behind wood pile but they rode around begun on him he firing back they galloping cavorting yelling banging away with all their might think he wounded couple them but they closed on him chased him into river as he swum along down stream they followed along bank kept on shooting at him when he struck shore he was dead windy marshall told me about it he saw it he was captain boat years ago darnells was so thinned out that old man his two sons concluded they d leave country they started take steamboat just above no 10 but watsons got wind it they arrived just as two young darnells was walking up companion way with their wives on their arms fight begun then they never got no further both them killed after that old darnell got into trouble with man that run ferry ferry man got worst it died but his friends shot old darnell through through filled him full bullets ended him country gentleman who told me these things had been reared ease comfort was man good parts was college bred his loose grammar was fruit careless habit not ignorance this habit among educated men west is not universal but it is prevalent prevalent towns certainly if not cities degree which one cannot help noticing marveling at i heard westerner who would be accounted highly educated man any country say never mind it don t make no difference anyway life long resident who was present heard it but it made no impression upon her she was able recall fact afterward when reminded it but she confessed that words had not grated upon her ear at time confession which suggests that if educated people can hear such blasphemous grammar from such source be unconscious deed crime must be tolerably common so common that general ear has become dulled by familiarity with it is no longer alert no longer sensitive such affronts no one world speaks blemishless grammar no one has ever written it no one either world or out it taking scriptures for evidence on latter point therefore it would not be fair exact grammatical perfection from peoples valley but they all other peoples may justly be required refrain from knowingly purposely debauching their grammar i found river greatly changed at island no 10 island which i remembered was some three miles long quarter mile wide heavily timbered lay near kentucky shore within two hundred yards it i should say now however one had hunt for it with spy glass nothing was left it but insignificant little tuft this was no longer near kentucky shore it was clear over against opposite shore mile away war times island had been important place for it commanded situation being heavily fortified there was no getting by it it lay between upper lower divisions union forces kept them separate until junction was finally effected across missouri neck land but island being itself joined that neck now wide river is without obstruction this region river passes from kentucky into tennessee back into missouri then back into kentucky thence into tennessee again so mile or two missouri sticks over into tennessee town new madrid was looking very unwell but otherwise unchanged from its former condition aspect its blocks frame houses were still grouped same old flat plain environed by same old forests it was as tranquil as formerly apparently had neither grown nor diminished size it was said that recent high water had invaded it damaged its looks this was surprising news for low water river bank is very high there fifty feet my day overflow had always been considered impossibility this present flood 1882 will doubtless be celebrated river s history for several generations before deluge like magnitude shall be seen it put all unprotected low lands under water from cairo mouth it broke down levees great many places on both sides river some regions south when flood was at its highest mississippi was seventy miles wide number lives were lost destruction property was fearful crops were destroyed houses washed away shelterless men cattle forced take refuge on scattering elevations here there field forest wait peril suffering until boats put

america from england scattering ones at first then sort procession them procession which kept up its plodding patient march through land during many many years each tourist took notes went home published book book which was usually calm truthful reasonable kind but which seemed just reverse our tender footed progenitors glance at these tourist books shows us that certain its aspects mississippi has undergone no change since those strangers visited it but remains day about as it was then emotions produced those foreign breasts by these aspects were not all formed on one pattern course they had be various along at first because earlier tourists were obliged originate their emotions whereas older countries one can always borrow emotions from one s predecessors mind you emotions are among toughest things world manufacture out whole cloth it is easier manufacture seven facts than one emotion captain basil hall r n writing fifty five years ago says here i caught first glimpse object i had so long wished behold felt myself amply repaid at that moment for all trouble i had experienced coming so far stood looking at river flowing past till it was too dark distinguish anything but it was not till i had visited same spot dozen times that i came right comprehension grandeur scene following are mrs trollope s emotions she is writing few months later same year 1827 is coming at mouth mississippi first indication our approach land was appearance this mighty river pouring forth its muddy mass waters mingling with deep blue mexican gulf i never beheld scene so utterly desolate as this entrance mississippi had dante seen it he might have drawn images another borgia from its horrors one only object rears itself above eddying waters this is mast vessel long since

when you ascend mighty current for fifty or hundred miles use eye imagination as well as that nature that you begin understand all his might majesty you see him fertilizing boundless valley bearing along his course trophies his thousand victories over shattered forest here carrying away large masses soil with all their growth there forming islands destined at some future period be residence man while indulging this prospect it is then time for reflection suggest that current before you has flowed through two or three thousand miles has yet travel one thousand three hundred more before reaching its ocean destination receive now emotions captain marryat r n author sea tales writing 1837 three years after mr murray never perhaps records nations was there instance century such unvarying unmitigated crime as is be collected from history turbulent blood stained mississippi stream itself appears as if appropriate for deeds which have been committed it is not like most rivers beautiful sight bestowing fertility its course not one that eye loves dwell upon as it sweeps along nor can you wander upon its banks or trust yourself without danger its stream it is furious rapid desolating torrent loaded with alluvial soil few those who are received into its waters ever rise again footnote there was foolish superstition some little prevalence that day that mississippi would neither buoy up swimmer nor permit drowned person s body rise surface or can support themselves long upon its surface without assistance from some friendly log it contains coarsest most uneatable fish such as cat fish such genus as you descend its banks are occupied with fetid alligator while panther basks at its edge cane brakes almost impervious man pouring its impetuous waters through wild tracks covered with trees little value except for firewood it sweeps down whole forests its course which disappear tumultuous confusion whirled away by stream now loaded with masses soil which nourished their roots often blocking up changing for time channel river which as if anger at its being opposed inundates devastates whole country round as soon as it forces its way through its former

mississippi it was with indescribable emotions that i first felt myself afloat upon its waters how often my schoolboy dreams my waking visions afterwards had my imagination pictured itself lordly stream rolling with tumultuous current through boundless region which it has given its name gathering into itself its course ocean tributary waters almost every latitude temperate zone here it was then its reality i at length steaming against its tide i looked upon it with that reverence with which everyone must regard great feature external nature so much for emotions tourists one all remark upon deep brooding loneliness desolation vast river captain basil hall who saw it at flood stage says sometimes we passed along distances twenty or thirty miles without seeing single habitation artist search hints for painting deluge would here have found them abundance first shall be last etc just two hundred years ago old original first gallantest all foreign tourists pioneer head procession ended his weary tedious discovery voyage down solemn stretches great river la salle whose name will last as long as river itself shall last we quote from mr parkman now they neared their journey s end on sixth april river divided itself into three broad channels la salle followed that west d autray that east while tonty took middle passage as he drifted down turbid current between low marshy shores brackish water changed brine breeze grew fresh with salt breath sea then broad bosom great gulf opened on his sight tossing its restless billows limitless voiceless lonely as when born chaos without sail without sign life then on spot solid ground la salle reared column bearing arms france frenchmen were mustered under arms while new england indians their squaws looked on wondering silence they

river vast countries watered by it name king column bore this inscription louis le grand roy de france et de navarre regne le neuvieme avril 1682 new orleans intended fittingly celebrate this present year bicentennial anniversary this illustrious event but when time came all her energies surplus money were required other directions for flood was upon land then making havoc devastation everywhere chapter 28 uncle mumford unloads all day we swung along down river had stream almost wholly ourselves formerly at such stage water we should have passed acres lumber rafts dozens big coal barges also occasional little trading scows peddling along from farm farm with peddler s family on board possibly random scow bearing humble hamlet co on itinerant dramatic trip but these were all absent far along day we saw one steamboat just one no more she was lying at rest shade within wooded mouth obion river spy glass revealed fact that she was named for me or he was named for me whichever you prefer as this was first time i had ever encountered this species honor it seems excusable mention it at same time call attention authorities tardiness my recognition it noted big change river at island 21 it was very large island used be out toward mid stream but it is joined fast main shore now has retired from business as island as we approached famous formidable plum point darkness fell but that was nothing shudder about these modern times for now national government has turned mississippi into sort two thousand mile torchlight procession head every crossing foot every crossing government has set up clear burning lamp you are never entirely dark now there is always beacon sight either before you or behind you or abreast one might almost say that lamps have been squandered there dozens crossings are lighted which were not shoal when they were created have never been shoal since crossings so plain too also so straight that steamboat can take herself through them without any help after she has been through once lamps such places are course not wasted it is much more convenient comfortable for pilot hold on them than on spread formless blackness that won t stay still money is saved boat at same time for she can course make more miles with her rudder amidships than she can with it squared across her stern holding her back but this thing has knocked romance out piloting large extent it some other things together have knocked all romance out it for instance peril from snags is not now what it once was government s snag boats go patrolling up down these matter fact days pulling river s teeth they have rooted out all old clusters which made many localities so formidable they allow no new ones collect formerly if your boat got away from you on black night broke for woods it was anxious time with you so was it also when you were groping your way through solidified darkness narrow chute but all that is changed now you flash out your electric light transform night into day twinkling eye your perils anxieties are at end horace bixby george ritchie have charted crossings laid out courses by compass they have invented lamp go with chart have patented whole with these helps one may run fog now with considerable security with confidence unknown old days with these abundant beacons banishment snags plenty daylight box ready be turned on whenever needed chart compass fight fog with piloting at good stage water is now nearly as safe simple as driving stage is hardly more than three times as romantic now these new days these days infinite change anchor line have raised captain above pilot by giving him bigger wages two this was going far but they have not stopped there they have decreed that pilot shall remain at his post stand his watch clear through whether boat be under way or tied up shore we that were once aristocrats river can t go bed now as we used do sleep while hundred tons freight are lugged aboard no we must sit pilot house keep awake too verily we are being treated like parcel mates engineers government has taken away romance our calling company has taken away its state dignity plum point looked as it had always looked by night with exception that now there were beacons mark crossings also lot other lights on point along its shore these latter glinting from fleet united states river commission from village which officials have built on land for offices for employees service military engineers commission have taken upon their shoulders job making mississippi over again job transcended size by only original job creating it they are building wing dams here there deflect current dikes confine it narrower bounds other dikes make it stay there for unnumbered miles along mississippi they are felling timber front for fifty yards back with purpose shaving bank down low water mark with slant house roof ballasting it with stones many places they have protected wasting shores with rows piles one who knows mississippi will promptly aver not aloud but himself that ten thousand river commissions with mines world at their back cannot tame that lawless stream cannot curb it or confine it cannot say it go here or go there make it obey cannot save shore which it has sentenced cannot bar its path with obstruction which it will not tear down dance over laugh at but discreet man will not put these things into spoken words for west point engineers have not their superiors anywhere they know all that can be known their abstruse science so since they conceive that they can fetter handcuff that river boss him it is but wisdom for unscientific man keep still lie low wait till they do it captain eads with his jetties has done work at mouth mississippi which seemed clearly impossible so we do not feel full confidence now prophesy against like impossibilities otherwise one would pipe out say commission might as well bully comets their courses undertake make them behave as try bully mississippi into right reasonable conduct i consulted uncle mumford concerning this cognate matters i give here result stenographically reported therefore be relied on as being full correct except that i have here there left out remarks which were addressed men such as where blazes are you going with that barrel now which seemed me break flow written statement without compensating by adding its information or its clearness not that i have ventured strike out all such interjections i have removed only those which were obviously irrelevant wherever one occurred which i felt any question about i have judged it safest let it remain uncle mumford s impressions uncle mumford said as long as i have been mate steamboat thirty years i have watched this river studied it maybe i could have learnt more about it at west point but if i believe it i wish i may be what are you sucking your fingers there for collar that kag nails four years at west point plenty books schooling will learn man good deal i reckon but it won t learn him river you turn one those little european rivers over this commission with its hard bottom clear water it would just be holiday job for them wall it pile it dike it tame it down boss it around make it go wherever they wanted it stay where they put it do just as they said every time but this ain t that kind river they have started here with big confidence best intentions world but they are going get left what does ecclesiastes vii 13 say says enough knock their little game galley west don t it now you look at their methods once there at devil s island upper river they wanted water go one way water wanted go another so they put up stone wall but what does river care for stone wall when it got ready it just bulged through it maybe they can build another that will stay that is up there but not down here they can t down here lower river they drive some pegs turn water away from shore stop it from slicing off bank very well don t it go straight over cut somebody else s bank certainly are they going peg all banks why they could buy ground build new mississippi cheaper they are pegging bulletin tow head now it won t do any good if river has got mortgage on that island it will foreclose sure pegs or no pegs away down yonder they have driven two rows piles straight through middle dry bar half mile long which is forty foot out water when river is low what do you reckon that is for if i know i wish i may land hump yourself you son undertaker out with that coal oil now lively lively just look at what they are trying do down there at milliken s bend there s been cut off that section vicksburg is left out cold it s country town now river strikes below it boat can t go up town except high water well they are going build wing dams bend opposite foot 103 throw water over cut off foot island plow down into old ditch where river used be ancient times they think they can persuade water around that way get it strike above vicksburg as it used do fetch town back into world again that is they are going take this whole mississippi twist it around make it run several miles up stream well you ve got admire men that deal ideas that size can tote them around without crutches but you haven t got believe they can do such miracles have you yet you ain t absolutely obliged believe they can t i reckon safe way where man can afford it is copper operation at same time buy enough property vicksburg square you up case they win government is doing deal for mississippi now spending loads money on her when there used be four thousand steamboats ten thousand acres coal barges rafts trading scows there wasn t lantern from st paul new orleans snags were thicker than bristles on hog s back now when there s three dozen steamboats nary barge or raft government has snatched out all snags lit up shores like broadway boat s as safe on river as she d be heaven i reckon that by time there ain t any boats left at all commission will have old thing all reorganized dredged out fenced tidied up degree that will make navigation just simply perfect absolutely safe profitable all days will be sundays all mates will be sunday school su what nation you fooling around there for you sons unrighteousness heirs perdition going be year getting that hogshead ashore during our trip new orleans back we had many conversations with river men planters journalists officers river commission with conflicting confusing results wit 1 some believed commission s scheme arbitrarily permanently confine thus deepen channel preserve threatened shores etc 2 some believed that commission s money ought be spent only on building repairing great system levees 3 some believed that higher you build your levee higher river s bottom will rise that consequently levee system is mistake 4 some believed scheme relieve river flood time by turning its surplus waters off into lake borgne etc 5 some believed scheme northern lake reservoirs replenish mississippi low water seasons wherever you find man down there who believes one these theories you may turn next man frame your talk upon hypothesis that he does not believe that theory after you have had experience you do not take this course doubtfully or hesitatingly but with confidence dying murderer converted one i mean for you will have come know with deep restful certainty that you are not going meet two people sick same theory one right after other no there will always be one or two with other diseases along between as you proceed you will find out one or two other things you will find out that there is no distemper lot but is contagious you cannot go where it is without catching it you may vaccinate yourself with deterrent facts as much as you please it will do no good it will seem take but it doesn t moment you rub against any one those theorists make up your mind that it is time hang out your yellow flag yes you are his sure victim yet his work is not all your hurt only part it for he is like your family physician who comes cures mumps leaves scarlet fever behind if your man is lake borgne relief theorist for instance he will exhale cloud deadly facts statistics which will lay you out with that disease sure but at same time he will cure you any other five theories that may have previously got into your system i have had all five had them bad but ask me not mournful numbers which one racked me hardest or which one numbered biggest sick list for i do not know truth no one can answer latter question mississippi improvement is mighty topic down yonder every man on river banks south cairo talks about it every day during such moments as he is able spare from talking about war each several chief theories has its host zealous partisans but as i have said it is not possible determine which cause numbers most recruits all were agreed upon one point however if congress would make sufficient appropriation colossal benefit would result very well since then appropriation has been made possibly sufficient one certainly not too large one let us hope that prophecy will be amply fulfilled one thing will be easily granted by reader that opinion from mr edward atkinson upon any vast national commercial matter comes as near ranking as authority as can opinion any individual union what he has say about mississippi river improvement will be found appendix footnote see appendix b sometimes half dozen figures will reveal as with lightning flash importance subject which ten thousand labored words with same purpose view had left at last but dim uncertain here is case sort paragraph from cincinnati commercial towboat jos b williams is on her way new orleans with tow thirty two barges containing six hundred thousand bushels seventy six pounds bushel coal exclusive her own fuel being largest tow ever taken new orleans or anywhere else world her freight bill at 3 cents bushel amounts 18 000 it would take eighteen hundred cars three hundred thirty three bushels car transport this amount coal at 10 per ton or 100 per car which would be fair price for distance by rail freight bill would amount 180 000 or 162 000 more by rail than by river tow will be taken from pittsburg new orleans fourteen or fifteen days it would take one hundred trains eighteen cars train transport this one tow six hundred thousand bushels coal even if it made usual speed fast freight lines it would take one whole summer put it through by rail when river good condition can enable one save 162 000 whole summer s time on single cargo wisdom taking measures keep river good condition is made plain even uncommercial mind chapter 29 few specimen bricks we passed through plum point region turned craighead s point glided unchallenged by what was once formidable fort pillow memorable because massacre perpetrated there during war massacres are sprinkled with some frequency through histories several christian nations but this is almost only one that can be found american history perhaps it is only one which rises size correspondent that huge somber title we have boston massacre where two or three people were killed but we must bunch anglo saxon history together find fellow fort pillow tragedy doubtless even then we must travel back days performances coeur de lion that fine hero before we accomplish it more river s freaks times past channel used strike above island 37 by brandywine bar down towards island 39 afterward changed its course went from brandywine down through vogelman s chute devil s elbow island 39 part this course reversing old order river running up four or five miles instead down cutting off throughout some fifteen miles distance this 1876 all that region is now called centennial island there is tradition that island 37 was one principal abiding places once celebrated murel s gang this was colossal combination robbers horse thieves negro stealers counterfeiters engaged business along river some fifty or sixty years ago while our journey across country towards st louis was progress we had had no end jesse james his stirring history for he had just been assassinated by agent governor missouri was consequence occupying good deal space newspapers cheap histories him were for sale by train boys according these he was most marvelous creature his kind that had ever existed it was mistake murel was his equal boldness pluck rapacity cruelty brutality heartlessness treachery general comprehensive vileness shamelessness very much his superior some larger aspects james was retail rascal murel wholesale james s modest genius dreamed no loftier flight than planning raids upon cars coaches country banks murel projected negro insurrections capture new orleans furthermore on occasion this murel could go into pulpit edify congregation what are james his half dozen vulgar rascals compared with this stately old time criminal with his sermons his meditated insurrections city captures his majestic following ten hundred men sworn do his evil will here is paragraph or two concerning this big operator from now forgotten book which was published half century ago he appears have been most dexterous as well as consummate villain when he traveled his usual disguise was that itinerant preacher it is said that his discourses were very soul moving interesting hearers so much that they forgot look after their horses which were carried away by his confederates while he was preaching but stealing horses one state selling them another was but small portion their business most lucrative was enticing slaves run away from their masters that they might sell them another quarter this was arranged as follows they would tell negro that if he would run away from his master allow them sell him he should receive portion money paid for him that upon his return them second time they would send him free state where he would be safe poor wretches complied with this request hoping obtain money freedom they would be sold another master run away again their employers sometimes they would be sold this manner three or four times until they had realized three or four thousand dollars by them but as after this there was fear detection usual custom was get rid only witness that could be produced against them which was negro himself by murdering him throwing his body into mississippi even if it was established that they had stolen negro before he was murdered they were always prepared evade punishment for they concealed negro who had run away until he was advertised reward offered any man who would catch him advertisement this kind warrants person take property if found then negro becomes property trust when therefore they sold negro it only became breach trust not stealing for breach trust owner property can only have redress by civil action which was useless as damages were never paid it may be inquired how it was that murel escaped lynch law under such circumstances this will be easily understood when it is stated that he had more than thousand sworn confederates all ready at moment s notice support any gang who might be trouble names all principal confederates murel were obtained from himself manner which i shall presently explain gang was composed two classes heads or council as they were called who planned concerted but seldom acted they amounted about four hundred other class were active agents were termed strikers amounted about six hundred fifty these were tools hands others they ran all risk received but small portion money they were power leaders gang who would sacrifice them at any time by handing them over justice or sinking their bodies mississippi general rendezvous this gang miscreants was on arkansas side river where they concealed their negroes morasses cane brakes depredations this extensive combination were severely felt but so well were their plans arranged that although murel who was always active was everywhere suspected there was no proof be obtained it so happened however that young man name stewart who was looking after two slaves which murel had decoyed away fell with him obtained his confidence took oath was admitted into gang as one general council by this means all was discovered for stewart turned traitor although he had taken oath having obtained every information exposed whole concern names all parties finally succeeded bringing home sufficient evidence against murel procure his conviction sentence penitentiary murel was sentenced fourteen years imprisonment so many people who were supposed be honest bore respectable name different states were found be among list grand council as published by stewart that every attempt was made throw discredit upon his assertions his character was vilified more than one attempt was made assassinate him he was obliged quit southern states consequence it is however now well ascertained have been all true although some blame mr stewart for having violated his oath they no longer attempt deny that his revelations were correct i will quote one or two portions murel s confessions mr stewart made him when they were journeying together i ought have observed that ultimate intentions murel his associates were by his own account on very extended scale having no less object view than raising blacks against whites taking possession plundering new orleans making themselves possessors territory following are few extracts i collected all my friends about new orleans at one our friends houses that place we sat council three days before we got all our plans our notion we then determined undertake rebellion at every hazard make as many friends as we could for that purpose every man s business being assigned him i started natchez on foot having sold my horse new orleans with intention stealing another after i started i walked four days no opportunity offered for me get horse fifth day about twelve i had become tired stopped at creek get some water rest

rode up i saw from his equipage that he was traveler i arose drew elegant rifle pistol on him ordered him dismount he did so i took his horse by bridle pointed down creek ordered him walk before me he went few hundred yards stopped i hitched his horse then made him undress himself all his shirt drawers ordered him turn his back me he said if you are determined kill me let me have time pray before i

cumberland mountain crenshaw soon knew all about his business he had been tennessee buy drove hogs but when he got there pork was dearer than he calculated he declined purchasing we concluded he was prize crenshaw winked at me i understood his idea crenshaw had traveled road before but i never had we had traveled several miles on mountain when he passed near great precipice just before we passed it crenshaw asked me for my whip which had pound lead butt i handed it him he rode up by side south carolinian gave him blow on side head tumbled him from his horse we lit from our horses fingered his pockets we got twelve hundred sixty two dollars crenshaw said he knew place hide him he gathered him under his arms i by his feet conveyed him deep crevice brow precipice tumbled him into it he went

tortoise catfish before this time frogs have sung this many long day silent repose his skeleton we were approaching memphis front which city witnessed by its people was fought most famous river battles civil war two men whom i had served under my river days took part that fight mr bixby head pilot union fleet montgomery commodore confederate fleet both saw great deal active service during war achieved high reputations for pluck capacity as we neared memphis we began cast about for excuse stay with gold dust end her course vicksburg we were so pleasantly situated that we did not wish

memphis till ten next morning it is beautiful city nobly situated on commanding bluff overlooking river streets are straight spacious though not paved way incite distempered admiration no admiration must be reserved for town s sewerage system which is called perfect recent reform however for it was just other way up few years ago reform resulting from lesson taught by desolating visitation yellow

this boat s hurricane deck aft i was joined there by stranger who dropped into conversation with me brisk young fellow who said he was born town interior wisconsin had never seen steamboat until week before also said that on way down from la crosse he had inspected examined his boat so diligently with such passionate interest that he had mastered whole thing from stem rudder blade asked me where i was from i answered new england oh yank said he went chatting straight along without waiting for assent or denial he immediately proposed take me all over boat tell me names her different parts teach me their uses before i could enter protest or excuse he was already rattling glibly away at his benevolent work when i perceived that he was misnaming things inhospitably amusing himself at expense innocent stranger from far country i held my peace let him have his way he gave me world misinformation further he went wider his imagination expanded more he enjoyed his cruel work deceit sometimes after palming off particularly fantastic outrageous lie upon me he was so full laugh that he had step aside for minute upon one pretext or another keep me from suspecting i staid faithfully by him

this boat that you don t know name or purpose you come me i ll tell you i said i would took my departure disappeared approached him from another quarter whence he could not see me there he sat all alone doubling himself up writhing this way that throes unappeasable laughter he must have made himself sick for he was not publicly visible afterward for several days meantime episode dropped out my mind thing that reminded me it now when i was alone at wheel was spectacle this young fellow standing pilot house door with knob his hand silently severely inspecting me i don t know when i have seen anybody look so injured as he did he did not say anything simply stood there looked reproachfully looked pondered finally he shut door started away halted on texas minute came slowly back stood door again with that grieved look his face gazed upon me awhile meek rebuke then said you let me learn you all about steamboat didn t you yes i confessed yes you did didn t you yes you are feller that that language failed pause impotent struggle for further words then he gave it up choked out deep strong oath departed for good afterward i saw him several times below during trip but he was cold would not look at me idiot if he had not been such sweat play his witless practical joke upon me beginning i would have persuaded his thoughts into some other direction saved him from committing that wanton

not heard before it being recent birth arkansas city it was born railway little rock mississippi river texas railroad touches river there we asked passenger who belonged there what sort place it was well said he after considering with air one who wishes take time be accurate it s hell place description which was photographic for exactness there were several rows clusters shabby frame houses supply mud sufficient insure town against famine that article for hundred years for overflow had but lately subsided there were stagnant ponds streets here there dozen rude scows were scattered about lying aground wherever they happened have been when waters drained off people could do their visiting shopping on foot once more still it is thriving place with rich country behind it elevator front it also fine big mill for manufacture cotton seed oil i had never seen this kind mill before cotton seed was comparatively valueless my time but it is worth 12 or 13 ton now none it is thrown away oil made from it is colorless tasteless almost if not entirely odorless it is claimed that it can by proper manipulation be made resemble perform office any all oils be produced at cheaper rate than cheapest originals sagacious people shipped it italy doctored it labeled it brought it back as olive oil this trade grew be so formidable that italy was obliged put prohibitory impost upon it keep it from working serious injury her oil industry helena occupies one prettiest situations on mississippi her perch is last southernmost group hills which one sees on that side river its normal condition it is pretty town but flood or possibly seepage had lately been ravaging it whole streets houses had been invaded by muddy water outsides buildings were still belted with broad stain extending upwards

time noonday bright sunny this was bad not best anyway for mine was not preferably noonday kind errand more i thought more that fact pushed itself upon me now one form now another finally it took form distinct question is it good common sense do errand daytime when by little sacrifice comfort inclination you can have night for it no inquisitive eyes around this settled it plain question plain answer make shortest road out most perplexities i got my friends into my stateroom said i was sorry create annoyance disappointment but that upon reflection it really seemed best that we put our luggage ashore stop over at napoleon their disapproval was prompt loud their language mutinous their main argument was one which has always been first come surface such cases since beginning time but you decided agreed stick this boat etc as if having determined do unwise thing one is thereby bound go ahead make two unwise things it by carrying out that determination i tried various mollifying tactics upon them with reasonably good success under which encouragement i increased my efforts show them that i had not created this annoying errand was no way blame for it i presently drifted into its history substantially as follows toward end last year i spent few months munich bavaria november i was living fraulein dahlweiner s pension 1a karlstrasse but my working quarters were mile from there house widow who supported herself by taking lodgers she her two young children used drop every morning talk german me by request one day during ramble about city i visited one two establishments where government keeps watches corpses until doctors decide that they are permanently dead not trance state it was grisly place that spacious room there were thirty six corpses adults sight stretched on their backs on slightly slanted boards three long rows all them with wax white rigid faces all them wrapped white shrouds along sides room were deep alcoves like bay windows each these lay several marble visaged babes utterly hidden buried under banks fresh flowers all but their faces crossed hands around finger each these fifty still forms both great small was ring from ring wire led ceiling thence bell watch room yonder where day night watchman sits always alert ready spring aid any that pallid company who waking out death shall make movement for any even slightest movement will twitch wire ring that fearful bell i imagined myself death sentinel drowsing there alone far dragging watches some wailing gusty night having twinkling all my body stricken quivering jelly by sudden clamor that awful summons so i inquired about this thing asked what resulted usually if watchman died restored corpse came did what it could make his last moments easy but i was rebuked for trying feed idle frivolous curiosity so solemn so mournful place went my way with humbled crest next morning i was telling widow my adventure when she exclaimed come with me i have lodger who shall tell you all you want know he has been night watchman there he was living man but he did not look it he was abed had his head propped high on pillows his face was wasted colorless his deep sunken eyes were shut his hand lying on his breast was talon like it was so bony long fingered widow began her introduction me man s eyes opened slowly glittered wickedly out from twilight their caverns he frowned black frown he lifted his lean hand waved us peremptorily away but widow kept straight on till she had got out fact that i was stranger american man s face changed at once brightened became even eager next moment he i were alone together i opened up cast iron german he responded quite flexible english thereafter we gave german language permanent rest this consumptive i became good friends i visited him every day we talked about everything at least about everything but wives children let anybody s wife or anybody s child be mentioned three things always followed most gracious loving tender light glimmered man s eyes for moment faded out next its place came that deadly look which had flamed there first time i ever saw his lids unclose thirdly he ceased from speech there then for that day lay silent abstracted absorbed apparently heard nothing that i said took no notice my good byes plainly did not know by either sight or hearing when i left room when i had been this karl ritter s daily sole intimate during two months he one day said abruptly i will tell you my story dying man s confession then he went on as follows i have never given up until now but now i have given up i am going die i made up my mind last night that it must be very soon too you say you are going revisit your river by bye when you find opportunity very well that together with certain strange experience which fell my lot last night determines me tell you my history for you will see napoleon arkansas for my sake you will stop there do certain thing for me thing which you will willingly undertake after you shall have heard my narrative let us shorten story wherever we can for it will need it being long you already know how i came go america how i came settle that lonely region south but you do not know that i had wife my wife was young beautiful loving oh so divinely good blameless gentle our little girl was her mother miniature it was happiest happy households one night it was toward close war i woke up out sodden lethargy found myself bound gagged air tainted with chloroform i saw two men room one was saying other hoarse whisper i told her i would if she made noise as for child other man interrupted low half crying voice you said we d only gag them rob them not hurt them or i wouldn t have come shut up your whining had change plan when they waked up you done all you could protect them now let that satisfy you come help rummage both men were masked wore coarse ragged nigger clothes they had bull s eye lantern by its light i noticed that gentler robber had no thumb on his right hand they rummaged around my poor cabin for moment head bandit then said his stage whisper it s waste time he shall tell where it s hid undo his gag revive him up other said all right provided no clubbing no clubbing it is then provided he keeps still they approached me just then there was sound outside sound voices trampling hoofs robbers held their breath listened sounds came slowly nearer nearer then came shout hello house show light we want water captain s voice by g said stage whispering ruffian both robbers fled by way back door shutting off their bull s eye as they ran strangers shouted several times more then rode by there seemed be dozen horses i heard nothing more i struggled but could not free myself from my bonds i tried speak but gag was effective i could not make sound i listened for my wife s voice my child s listened long intently but no sound came from other end room where their bed was this silence became more more awful more more ominous every moment could you have endured hour it do you think pity me then who had endure three three hours it was three ages whenever clock struck it seemed as if years had gone by since i had heard it last all this time i was struggling my bonds at last about dawn i got myself free rose up stretched my stiff limbs i was able distinguish details pretty well floor was littered with things thrown there by robbers during their search for my savings first object that caught my particular attention was document mine which i had seen rougher two ruffians glance at then cast away it had blood on it i staggered other end room oh poor unoffending helpless ones there they lay their troubles ended mine begun did i appeal law i does it quench pauper s thirst if king drink for him oh no no no i wanted no impertinent interference law laws gallows could not pay debt that was owing me let laws leave matter my hands have no fears i would find debtor collect debt how accomplish this do you say how accomplish it feel so sure about it when i had neither seen robbers faces nor heard their natural voices nor had any idea who they might be nevertheless i was sure quite sure quite confident i had clue clue which you would not have valued clue which would not have greatly helped even detective since he would lack secret how apply it i shall come that presently you shall see let us go on now taking things their due order there was one circumstance which gave me slant definite direction begin with those two robbers were manifestly soldiers tramp disguise not new military service but old it regulars perhaps they did not acquire their soldierly attitude gestures carriage day nor month nor yet year so i thought but said nothing one them had said captain s voice by g one whose life i would have two miles away several regiments were camp two companies u s cavalry when i learned that captain blakely company c had passed our way that night with escort i said nothing but that company i resolved seek my man conversation i studiously persistently described robbers as tramps camp followers among this class people made useless search none suspecting soldiers but me working patiently by night my desolated home i made disguise for myself out various odds ends clothing nearest village i bought pair blue goggles by bye when military camp broke up company c was ordered hundred miles north napoleon i secreted my small hoard money my belt took my departure night when company c arrived napoleon i was already there yes i was there with new trade fortune teller not seem partial i made friends told fortunes among all companies garrisoned there but i gave company c great bulk my attentions i made myself limitlessly obliging these particular men they could ask me no favor put upon me no risk which i would decline i became willing butt their jokes this perfected my popularity i became favorite i early found private who lacked thumb what joy it was me when i found that he alone all company had lost thumb my last misgiving vanished i was sure i was on right track this man s name was kruger german there were nine germans company i watched see who might be his intimates but he seemed have no especial intimates but i was his intimate i took care make intimacy grow sometimes i so hungered for my revenge that i could hardly restrain myself from going on my knees begging him point out man who had murdered my wife child but i managed bridle my tongue i bided my time went on telling fortunes as opportunity offered my apparatus was simple little red paint bit white paper i painted ball client s thumb took print it on paper studied it that night revealed his fortune him next day what was my idea this nonsense it was this when i was youth i knew old frenchman who had been prison keeper for thirty years he told me that there was one thing about person which never changed from cradle grave lines ball thumb he said that these lines were never exactly alike thumbs any two human beings these days we photograph new criminal hang his picture rogues gallery for future reference but that frenchman his day used take print ball new prisoner s thumb put that away for future reference he always said that pictures were no good future disguises could make them useless thumb s only sure thing said he you can t disguise that he used prove his theory too on my friends acquaintances it always succeeded i went on telling fortunes every night i shut myself all alone studied day s thumb prints with magnifying glass imagine devouring eagerness with which i pored over those mazy red spirals with that document by my side which bore right hand thumb finger marks that unknown murderer printed with dearest blood me that was ever shed on this earth many many time i had repeat same old disappointed remark will they never correspond but my reward came at last it was print thumb forty third man company c whom i had experimented on private franz adler hour before i did not know murderer s name or voice or figure or face or nationality but now i knew all these things i believed i might feel sure frenchman s repeated demonstrations being so good warranty still there was way make sure i had impression kruger s left thumb morning i took him aside when he was off duty when we were out sight hearing witnesses i said impressively part your fortune is so grave that i thought it would be better for you if i did not tell it public you another man whose fortune i was studying last night private adler have been murdering woman child you are being dogged within five days both you will be assassinated he dropped on his knees frightened out his wits for five minutes he kept pouring out same set words like demented person same half crying way which was one my memories that murderous night my cabin i didn t do it upon my soul i didn t do it i tried keep him from doing it i did as god is my witness he did it alone this was all i wanted i tried get rid fool but no he clung me imploring me save him from assassin he said i have money ten thousand dollars hid away fruit loot thievery save me tell me what do you shall have it every penny two thirds it is my cousin adler s but you can take it all we hid it when we first came here but i hid it new place yesterday have not told him shall not tell him i was going desert get away with it all it is gold too heavy carry when one is running dodging but woman who has been gone over river two days prepare my way for me is going follow me with it if i got no chance describe hiding place her i was going slip my silver watch into her hand or send it her she would understand there s piece paper back case which tells it all here take watch tell me what do he was trying press his watch upon me was exposing paper explaining it me when adler appeared on scene about dozen yards away i said poor kruger put up your watch i don t want it you shan t come any harm go now i must tell adler his fortune presently i will tell you how escape assassin meantime i shall have examine your thumbmark again say nothing adler about this thing say nothing anybody he went away filled with fright gratitude poor devil i told adler long fortune purposely so long that i could not finish it promised come him on guard that night tell him really important part it tragical part it i said so must be out reach eavesdroppers they always kept picket watch outside town mere discipline ceremony no occasion for it no enemy around toward midnight i set out equipped with countersign picked my way toward lonely region where adler was keep his watch it was so dark that i stumbled right on dim figure almost before i could get out protecting word sentinel hailed i answered both at same moment i added it s only me fortune teller then i slipped poor devil s side without word i drove my dirk into his heart ya wohl laughed i it was tragedy part his fortune indeed as he fell from his horse he clutched at me my blue goggles remained his hand away plunged beast dragging him with his foot stirrup i fled through woods made good my escape leaving accusing goggles behind me that dead man s hand this was fifteen or sixteen years ago since then i have wandered aimlessly about earth sometimes at work sometimes idle sometimes with money sometimes with none but always tired life wishing it was done for my mission here was finished with act that night only pleasure solace satisfaction i had all those tedious years was daily reflection i have killed him four years ago my health began fail i had wandered into munich my purposeless way being out money i sought work got it did my duty faithfully about year was then given berth night watchman yonder that dead house which you visited lately place suited my mood i liked it i liked being with dead liked being alone with them i used wander among those rigid corpses peer into their austere faces by hour later time more impressive it was i preferred late time sometimes i turned lights low this gave perspective you see imagination could play always dim receding ranks dead inspired one with weird fascinating fancies two years ago i had been there year then i was sitting all alone watch room one gusty winter s night chilled numb comfortless drowsing gradually into unconsciousness sobbing wind slamming distant shutters falling fainter fainter upon my dulling ear each moment when sharp suddenly that dead bell rang out blood curdling alarum over my head shock it nearly paralyzed me for it was first time i had ever heard it i gathered myself together flew corpse room about midway down outside rank shrouded figure was sitting upright wagging its head slowly from one side other grisly spectacle its side was toward me i hurried it peered into its face heavens it was adler can you divine what my first thought was put into words it was this it seems then you escaped me once there will be different result this time evidently this creature was suffering unimaginable terrors think what it must have been wake up midst that voiceless hush look out over that grim congregation dead what gratitude shone his skinny white face when he saw living form before him how fervency this mute gratitude was augmented when his eyes fell upon life giving cordials which i carried my hands then imagine horror which came into this pinched face when i put cordials behind me said mockingly speak up franz adler call upon these dead doubtless they will listen have pity but here there is none else that will he tried speak but that part shroud which bound his jaws held firm would not let him he tried lift imploring hands but they were crossed upon his breast tied i said shout franz adler make sleepers distant streets hear you bring help shout lose no time for there is little lose what you cannot that is pity but it is no matter it does not always bring help when you your cousin murdered helpless woman child cabin arkansas my wife it was my child they shrieked for help you remember but it did no good you remember that it did no good is it not so your teeth chatter then why cannot you shout loosen bandages with your hands then you can ah i see your hands are tied they cannot aid you how strangely things repeat themselves after long years for my hands were tied that night you remember yes tied much as yours are now how odd that is i could not pull free it did not occur you untie me it does not occur me untie you sh there s late footstep it is coming this way hark how near it is one can count footfalls one two three there it is just outside now is time shout man shout it is one sole chance between you eternity ah you see you have delayed too long it is gone by there it is dying out it is gone think it reflect upon it you have heard human footstep for last time how curious it must be listen so common sound as that know that one will never hear fellow it again oh my friend agony that shrouded face was ecstasy see i thought new torture applied it assisting myself with trifle lying invention that poor kruger tried save my wife child i did him grateful good turn for it when time came i persuaded him rob you i woman helped him desert got him away safety look as surprise triumph shone out dimly through anguish my victim s face i was disturbed disquieted i said what then didn t he escape negative shake head no what happened then satisfaction shrouded face was still plainer man tried mumble out some words could not succeed tried express something with his obstructed hands failed paused moment then feebly tilted his head meaning way toward corpse that lay nearest him dead i asked failed escape caught act shot negative shake head how then again man tried do something with his hands i watched closely but could not guess intent i bent over watched still more intently he had twisted thumb around was weakly punching at his breast with it ah stabbed do you mean affirmative nod accompanied by spectral smile such peculiar devilishness that it struck awakening light through my dull brain i cried did i stab him mistaking him for you for that stroke was meant for none but you affirmative nod re dying rascal was as joyous as his failing strength was able put into its expression o miserable miserable me slaughter pitying soul that stood friend my darlings when they were helpless would have saved them if he could miserable oh miserable miserable me i fancied i heard muffled gurgle mocking laugh i took my face out my hands saw my enemy sinking back upon his inclined board he was satisfactory long time dying he had wonderful vitality astonishing constitution yes he was pleasant long time at it i got chair newspaper sat down by him read occasionally i took sip brandy this was necessary on account cold but i did it partly because i saw that along at first whenever i reached for bottle he thought i was going give him some i read aloud mainly imaginary accounts people snatched from grave s threshold restored life vigor by few spoonsful liquor warm bath yes he had long hard death it three hours six minutes from time he rang his bell it is believed that all these eighteen years that have elapsed since institution corpse watch no shrouded occupant bavarian dead houses has ever rung its bell well it is harmless belief let it stand at that chill that death room had penetrated my bones it revived fastened upon me disease which had been afflicting me but which up that night had been steadily disappearing that man murdered my wife my child three days hence he will have added me his list no matter god how delicious memory it i caught him escaping from his grave thrust him back into it after that night i was confined my bed for week but as soon as i could get about i went dead house books got number house which adler had died wretched lodging house it was it was my idea that he would naturally have gotten hold kruger s effects being his cousin i wanted get kruger s watch if i could but while i was sick adler s things had been sold scattered all except few old letters some odds ends no value however through those letters i traced out son kruger s only relative left he is man thirty now shoemaker by trade living at no 14 konigstrasse mannheim widower with several small children without explaining him why i have furnished two thirds his support ever since now as that watch see how strangely things happen i traced it around about germany for more than year at considerable cost money vexation at last i got it got it was unspeakably glad opened it found nothing it why i might have known that that bit paper was not going stay there all this time course i gave up that ten thousand dollars then gave it up dropped it out my mind most sorrowfully for i had wanted it for kruger s son last night when i consented at last that i must die i began make ready i proceeded burn all useless papers sure enough from batch adler s not previously examined with thoroughness out dropped that long desired scrap i recognized it moment here it is i will translate it brick livery stable stone foundation middle town corner orleans market corner toward court house third stone fourth row stick notice there saying how many are come there take it preserve it kruger explained that that stone was removable that it was north wall foundation fourth row from top third stone from west money is secreted behind it he said closing sentence was blind mislead case paper should fall into wrong hands it probably performed that office for adler now i want beg that when you make your intended journey down river you will hunt out that hidden money send it adam kruger care mannheim address which i have mentioned it will make rich man him i shall sleep sounder my grave for knowing that i have done what i could for son man who tried save my wife child albeit my hand ignorantly struck him down whereas impulse my heart would have been shield serve him chapter 32 disposal bonanza such was ritter s narrative said i my two friends there was profound impressive silence which lasted considerable time then both men broke into fusillade exciting admiring ejaculations over strange incidents tale this along with rattling fire questions was kept up until all hands were about out breath then my friends began cool down draw off under shelter occasional volleys into silence abysmal reverie for ten minutes now there was stillness then rogers said dreamily ten thousand dollars adding after considerable pause ten thousand it is heap money presently poet inquired are you going send it him right away yes i said it is queer question no reply after little rogers asked hesitatingly all it that is i mean certainly all it i was going say more but stopped was stopped by train thought which started up me thompson spoke but my mind was absent i did not catch what he said but i heard rogers answer yes it seems so me it ought be quite sufficient for i don t see that he has done anything presently poet said when you come look at it it is more than sufficient just look at it five thousand dollars why he couldn t spend it lifetime it would injure him too perhaps ruin him you want look at that little while he would throw his last away shut up his shop maybe take drinking maltreat his motherless children drift into other evil courses go steadily from bad worse yes that s it interrupted rogers fervently i ve seen it hundred times yes more than hundred you put money into hands man like that if you want destroy him that s all just put money into his hands it s all you ve got do if it don t pull him down take all usefulness out him all self respect everything then i don t know human nature ain t that so thompson even if we were give him third it why less than six months less than six weeks you d better say said i warming up breaking unless he had that three thousand dollars safe hands where he couldn t touch it he would no more last you six weeks than course he wouldn t said thompson i ve edited books for that kind people moment they get their hands on royalty maybe it s three thousand maybe it s two thousand what business has that shoemaker with two thousand dollars i should like know broke rogers earnestly man perhaps perfectly contented now there mannheim surrounded by his own class eating his bread with appetite which laborious industry alone can give enjoying his humble life honest upright pure heart blest yes i say blest blest above all myriads that go silk attire walk empty artificial round social folly but just you put that temptation before him once just you lay fifteen hundred dollars before man like that say fifteen hundred devils cried i five hundred would rot his principles paralyze his industry drag him rumshop thence gutter thence almshouse thence why put upon ourselves this crime gentlemen interrupted poet earnestly appealingly he is happy where he is as he is every sentiment honor every sentiment charity every sentiment high sacred benevolence warns us beseeches us commands us leave him undisturbed that is real friendship that is true friendship we could follow other courses that would be more showy but none that would be so truly kind wise depend upon it after some further talk it became evident that each us down his heart felt some misgivings over this settlement matter it was manifest that we all felt that we ought send poor shoemaker something there was long thoughtful discussion this point we finally decided send him chromo well now that everything seemed be arranged satisfactorily everybody concerned new trouble broke out it transpired that these two men were expecting share equally money with me that was not my idea i said that if they got half it between them they might consider themselves lucky rogers said who would have had any if it hadn t been for me i flung out first hint but for that it would all have gone shoemaker thompson said that he was thinking thing himself at very moment that rogers had originally spoken i retorted that idea would have occurred me plenty soon enough without anybody s help i was slow about thinking maybe but i was sure this matter warmed up into quarrel then into fight each man got pretty badly battered as soon as i had got myself mended up after fashion i ascended hurricane deck pretty sour humor i found captain mccord there said as pleasantly as my humor would permit i have come say good bye captain i wish go ashore at napoleon go ashore where napoleon captain laughed but seeing that i was not jovial mood stopped that said but are you serious serious i certainly am captain glanced up at pilot house said he wants get off at napoleon napoleon that s what he says great caesar s ghost uncle mumford approached along deck captain said uncle here s friend yours wants get off at napoleon well by i said come what is all this about can t man go ashore at napoleon if he wants why hang it don t you know there isn t any napoleon any more hasn t been for years years arkansas river burst through it tore it all rags emptied it into mississippi carried whole town away banks churches jails newspaper offices court house theater fire department livery stable everything

recognize it now it is most wonderful thing i ever heard by long shot most wonderful unexpected mr thompson mr rogers had arrived meantime with satchels umbrellas had silently listened captain s news thompson put half dollar my hand said softly for my share chromo rogers followed suit yes it was astonishing thing see mississippi rolling between unpeopled shores straight over spot where i used see good big self complacent town twenty years ago town that was county seat great important county town with big united states marine hospital town innumerable fights inquest every day town where i had used know prettiest girl most accomplished whole mississippi valley town where we were handed first printed news pennsylvania s mournful disaster quarter century ago town no more swallowed up vanished gone feed fishes nothing left but fragment shanty crumbling brick chimney chapter 33 refreshments ethics regard island 74 which is situated not far from former napoleon freak river here has sorely perplexed laws men made them vanity jest when state arkansas was chartered she controlled center river most unstable line state mississippi claimed channel another shifty unstable line no 74 belonged arkansas by by cut off threw this big island out arkansas yet not within mississippi middle river on one side it channel on other that is as i understand problem whether i have got details right or wrong this fact remains that here is this big exceedingly valuable island four thousand acres thrust out cold belonging neither one state nor other paying taxes neither owing allegiance neither one man owns whole island right is man without country island 92 belongs arkansas river moved it over joined it mississippi chap established whiskey shop there without mississippi license enriched himself upon mississippi custom under arkansas protection where no license was those days required we glided steadily down river usual privacy steamboat or other moving thing seldom seen scenery as always stretch upon stretch almost unbroken forest on both sides river soundless solitude here there cabin or two standing small openings on gray grassless banks cabins which had formerly stood quarter or half mile farther front gradually been pulled farther farther back as shores caved as at pilcher s point for instance where cabins had been moved back three hundred yards three months so we were told but caving banks had already caught up with them they were being conveyed rearward once more napoleon had but small opinion greenville mississippi old times but behold napoleon is gone cat fishes here is greenville full life activity making considerable flourish valley having three thousand inhabitants it is said doing gross trade 2 500 000 annually growing town there was much talk on boat about calhoun land company enterprise which is expected work wholesome results colonel calhoun grandson statesman went boston formed syndicate which purchased large tract land on river chicot county arkansas some ten thousand acres for cotton growing purpose is work on cash basis buy at first hands handle their own product supply their negro laborers with provisions necessaries at trifling profit say 8 or 10 per cent furnish them comfortable quarters etc encourage them save money remain on place if this proves financial success as seems quite certain they propose establish banking house greenville lend money at unburdensome rate interest 6 per cent is spoken trouble heretofore has been i am quoting remarks planters steamboatmen that planters although owning land were without cash capital had hypothecate both land crop carry on business consequently commission dealer who furnishes money takes some risk demands big interest usually 10 per cent 2 half per cent for negotiating loan planter has also buy his supplies through same dealer paying commissions profits then when he ships his crop dealer adds his commissions insurance etc so taking it by large first last dealer s share that crop is about 25 per cent footnote but what can state do where people are under subjection rates interest ranging from 18 30 per cent are also under necessity purchasing their crops advance even planting at these rates for privilege purchasing all their supplies at 100 per cent profit edward atkinson cotton planter s estimate average margin profit on planting his section one man mule will raise ten acres cotton giving ten bales cotton worth say 500 cost producing say 350 net profit 150 or 15 per acre there is also profit now from cotton seed which formerly had little value none where much transportation was necessary sixteen hundred pounds crude cotton four hundred are lint worth say ten cents pound twelve hundred pounds seed worth 12 or 13 per ton maybe future even stems will not be thrown away mr edward atkinson says that for each bale cotton there are fifteen hundred pounds stems that these are very rich phosphate lime potash that when ground mixed with ensilage or cotton seed meal which is too rich for use as fodder large quantities stem mixture makes superior food rich all elements needed for production milk meat bone heretofore stems have been considered nuisance complaint is made that planter remains grouty toward former slave since war will have nothing but chill business relation with him no sentiment permitted intrude will not keep store himself supply negro s wants thus protect negro s pocket make him able willing stay on place advantage him do it but lets that privilege some thrifty israelite who encourages thoughtless negro wife buy all sorts things which they could do without buy on credit at big prices month after month credit based on negro s share growing crop at end season negro s share belongs israelite negro is debt besides is discouraged dissatisfied restless both he planter are injured for he will take steamboat migrate planter must get stranger his place who does not know him does not care for him will fatten israelite season follow his predecessor per steamboat it is hoped that calhoun company will show by its humane protective treatment its laborers that its method is most profitable for both planter negro it is believed that general adoption that method will then follow where so many are saying their say shall not barkeeper testify he is thoughtful observant never drinks endeavors earn his salary would earn it if there were custom enough he says people along here mississippi louisiana will send up river buy vegetables rather than raise them they will come aboard at landings buy fruits barkeeper thinks they don t know anything but cotton believes they don t know how raise vegetables fruit at least most them says nigger will go h for watermelon h is all i find stenographer s report means halifax probably though that seems good way go for watermelon barkeeper buys watermelons for five cents up river brings them down sells them for fifty why does he mix such elaborate picturesque drinks for nigger hands on boat because they won t have any other they want big drink don t make any difference what you make it they want worth their money you give nigger plain gill half dollar brandy for five cents will he touch it no ain t size enough it but you put up pint all kinds worthless rubbish heave some red stuff make it beautiful red s main thing he wouldn t put down that glass go circus all bars on this anchor line are rented owned by one firm they furnish liquors from their own establishment hire barkeepers on salary good liquors yes on some boats where there are kind passengers that want it can pay for it on other boats no nobody but deck hands firemen drink it brandy yes i ve got brandy plenty it but you don t want any it unless you ve made your will it isn t as it used be old times then everybody traveled by steamboat everybody drank everybody treated everybody else now most everybody goes by railroad rest don t drink old times barkeeper owned bar himself was gay smarty talky all jeweled up was toniest aristocrat on boat used make 2 000 on trip father who left his son steamboat bar left him fortune now he leaves him board lodging yes washing if shirt trip will do yes indeedy times are changed why do you know on principal line boats on upper mississippi they don t have any bar at all sounds like poetry but it s petrified truth chapter 34 tough yarns stack island i remembered stack island also lake providence louisiana which is first distinctly southern looking town you come downward bound lies level low shade trees hung with venerable gray beards spanish moss restful pensive sunday aspect about place comments uncle mumford with feeling also with truth mr h furnished some minor details fact concerning this region which i would have hesitated believe if i had not known him be steamboat mate he was passenger ours resident arkansas city bound vicksburg join his boat little sunflower packet he was austere man had reputation being singularly unworldly for river man among other things he said that arkansas had been injured kept back by generations exaggerations concerning mosquitoes here one may smile said he turn matter off as being small thing but when you come look at effects produced way discouragement immigration diminished values property it was quite opposite small thing or thing any wise be coughed down or sneered at these mosquitoes had been persistently represented as being formidable lawless whereas truth is they are feeble insignificant size diffident fault sensitive so on so on you would have supposed he was talking about his family but if he was soft on arkansas mosquitoes he was hard enough on mosquitoes lake providence make up for it those lake providence colossi as he finely called them he said that two them could whip dog that four them could hold man down except help come they would kill him butcher him as he expressed it referred sort casual way yet significant way fact that life policy its simplest form is unknown lake providence they take out mosquito policy besides he told many remarkable things about those lawless insects among others said he had seen them try vote noticing that this statement seemed be good deal strain on us he modified it little said he might have been mistaken as that particular but knew he had seen them around polls canvassing there was another passenger friend h s who backed up harsh evidence against those mosquitoes detailed some stirring adventures which he had had with them stories were pretty sizable merely pretty sizable yet mr h was continually interrupting with cold inexorable wait knock off twenty five per cent that now go on or wait you are getting that too strong cut it down cut it down you get leetle too much costumery on your statements always dress fact tights never ulster or pardon once more if you are going load anything more on that statement you want get couple lighters tow rest because it s drawing all water there is river already stick facts just stick cold facts what these gentlemen want for book is frozen truth ain t that so gentlemen he explained privately that it was necessary watch this man all time keep him within bounds it would not do neglect this precaution as he mr h knew his sorrow said he i will not deceive you he told me such monstrous lie once that it swelled my left ear up spread it so that i was actually not able see out around it it remained so for months people came miles see me fan myself with it chapter 35 vicksburg during trouble we used plow past lofty hill city vicksburg down stream but we cannot do that now cut off has made country town it like osceola st genevieve several others there is currentless water also big island front vicksburg now you come down river other side island then turn come up town that is high water low water you can t come up but must land some distance below it signs scars still remain as reminders vicksburg s tremendous war experiences earthworks trees crippled by cannon balls cave refuges clay precipices etc caves did good service during six weeks bombardment city may 8 july 4 1863 they were used by non combatants mainly by women children not live constantly but fly for safety on occasion they were mere holes tunnels driven into perpendicular clay bank then branched y shape within hill life vicksburg during six weeks was perhaps but wait here are some materials out which reproduce it population twenty seven thousand soldiers three thousand non combatants city utterly cut off from world walled solidly frontage by gunboats rear by soldiers batteries hence no buying selling with outside no passing fro no god speeding parting guest no welcoming coming one no printed acres world wide news be read at breakfast mornings tedious dull absence such matter instead hence also no running see steamboats smoking into view distance up or down plowing toward town for none came river lay vacant undisturbed no rush turmoil around railway station no struggling over bewildered swarms passengers by noisy mobs hackmen all quiet there flour two hundred dollars barrel sugar thirty corn ten dollars bushel bacon five dollars pound rum hundred dollars gallon other things proportion consequently no roar racket drays carriages tearing along streets nothing for them do among that handful non combatants exhausted means at three o clock morning silence silence so dead that measured tramp sentinel can be heard seemingly impossible distance out hearing this lonely sound perhaps stillness is absolute all moment come ground shaking thunder crashes artillery sky is cobwebbed with crisscrossing red lines streaming from soaring bomb shells rain iron fragments descends upon city descends upon empty streets streets which are not empty moment later but mottled with dim figures frantic women children scurrying from home bed toward cave dungeons encouraged by humorous grim soldiery who shout rats your holes laugh cannon thunder rages shells scream crash overhead iron rain pours down one hour two hours three possibly six then stops silence follows but streets are still empty silence continues by bye head projects from cave here there yonder reconnoitres cautiously silence still continuing bodies follow heads jaded half smothered creatures group themselves about stretch their cramped limbs draw deep draughts grateful fresh air gossip with neighbors from next cave maybe straggle off home presently or take lounge through town if stillness continues will scurry holes again by bye when war tempest breaks forth once more there being but three thousand these cave dwellers merely population village would they not come know each other after week or two familiarly insomuch that fortunate or unfortunate experiences one would be interest all those are materials furnished by history from them might not almost anybody reproduce for himself life that time vicksburg could you who did not experience it come nearer reproducing it imagination another non participant than could vicksburger who did experience it it seems impossible yet there are reasons why it might not really be when one makes his first voyage ship it is experience which multitudinously bristles with striking novelties novelties which are such sharp contrast with all this person s former experiences that they take seemingly deathless grip upon his imagination memory by tongue or pen he can make landsman live that strange stirring voyage over with him make him see it all feel it all but if he wait if he make ten voyages succession what then why thing has lost color snap surprise has become commonplace man would have nothing tell that would quicken landsman s pulse years ago i talked with couple vicksburg non combatants man his wife left tell their story their own way those people told it without fire almost without interest week their wonderful life there would have made their tongues eloquent for ever perhaps but they had six weeks it that wore novelty all out they got used being bomb shelled out home into ground matter became commonplace after that possibility their ever being startlingly interesting their talks about it was gone what man said was this effect it got be sunday all time seven sundays week us anyway we hadn t anything do time hung heavy seven sundays all them broken up at one time or another day or night by few hours awful storm fire thunder iron at first we used shin for holes good deal faster than we did afterwards first time i forgot children maria fetched them both along when she was all safe cave she fainted two or three weeks afterwards when she was running for holes one morning through shell shower big shell burst near her covered her all over with dirt piece iron carried away her game bag false hair from back her head well she stopped get that game bag before she shoved along again was getting used things already you see we all got so that we could tell good deal about shells after that we didn t always go under shelter if it was light shower us men would loaf around talk man would say there she goes name kind shell it was from sound it go on talking if there wasn t any danger from it if shell was bursting close over us we stopped talking stood still uncomfortable yes but it wasn t safe move when it let go we went on talking again if nobody hurt maybe saying that was ripper or some such commonplace comment before we resumed or maybe we would see shell poising itself away high air overhead that case every fellow just whipped out sudden see you again gents shoved often often i saw gangs ladies promenading streets looking as cheerful as you please keeping eye canted up watching shells i ve seen them stop still when they were uncertain about what shell was going do wait make certain after that they sa ntered along again or lit out for shelter according verdict streets some towns have litter pieces paper odds ends one sort or another lying around ours hadn t they had iron litter sometimes man would gather up all iron fragments unbursted shells his neighborhood pile them into kind monument his front yard ton it sometimes no glass left glass couldn t stand such bombardment it was all shivered out windows houses vacant looked like eye holes skull whole panes were as scarce as news we had church sundays not many there along at first but by bye pretty good turnouts i ve seen service stop minute everybody sit quiet no voice heard pretty funeral like then all more so on account awful boom crash going on outside overhead pretty soon when body could be heard service would go on again organs church music mixed up with bombardment is powerful queer combination along at first coming out church one morning we had accident only one that happened around me on sunday i was just having hearty handshake with friend i hadn t seen for while saying drop into our cave night after bombardment we ve got hold pint prime wh whiskey i was going say you know but shell interrupted chunk it cut man s arm off left it dangling my hand do you know thing that is going stick longest my memory outlast everything else little big i reckon is mean thought i had then it was whiskey is saved yet don t you know it was kind excusable because it was as scarce as diamonds we had only just that little never had another taste during siege sometimes caves were desperately crowded always hot close sometimes cave had twenty or twenty five people packed into it no turning room for anybody air so foul sometimes you couldn t have made candle burn it child was born one those caves one night think that why it was like having it born trunk twice we had sixteen people our cave number times we had dozen pretty suffocating there we always had eight eight belonged there hunger misery sickness fright sorrow i don t know what all got so loaded into them that none them were ever rightly their old selves after siege they all died but three us within couple years one night shell burst front hole caved it stopped it up it was lively times for while digging out some us came near smothering after that we made two openings ought have thought it at first mule meat no we only got down that last day or two course it was good anything is good when you are starving this man had kept diary during six weeks no only first six days first day eight close pages second five third one loosely written fourth three or four lines line or two fifth sixth days seventh day diary abandoned life terrific vicksburg having now become commonplace matter course war history vicksburg has more about it interest general reader than that any other river towns it is full variety full incident full picturesque vicksburg held out longer than any other important river town saw warfare all its phases both land water siege mine assault repulse bombardment sickness captivity famine most beautiful all national cemeteries is here over great gateway is this inscription here rest peace 16 600 who died for their country years 1861 1865 grounds are nobly situated being very high commanding wide prospect land river they are tastefully laid out broad terraces with winding roads paths there is profuse adornment way semi tropical shrubs flowers one part is piece native wild wood left just as it grew therefore perfect its charm everything about this cemetery suggests hand national government government s work is always conspicuous for excellence solidity thoroughness neatness government does its work well first place then takes care it by winding roads which were often cut so great depth between perpendicular walls that they were mere roofless tunnels we drove out mile or two visited monument which stands upon scene surrender vicksburg general grant by general pemberton its metal will preserve it from hackings chippings which so defaced its predecessor which was marble but brick foundations are crumbling it will tumble down by bye it overlooks picturesque region wooded hills ravines is not unpicturesque itself being well smothered flowering weeds battered remnant marble monument has been removed national cemetery on road quarter mile townward aged colored man showed us with pride unexploded bomb shell which has lain his yard since day it fell there during siege i was stannin heah de dog was stannin heah de dog he went for de shell gwine pick fuss wid it but i didn t i says jes make you seff at home heah lay still whah you is or bust up de place jes as you s mind but i s got business out de woods i has vicksburg is town substantial business streets pleasant residences it commands commerce yazoo sunflower rivers is pushing railways several directions through rich agricultural regions has promising future prosperity importance apparently nearly all river towns big little have made up their minds that they must look mainly railroads for wealth upbuilding henceforth they are acting upon this idea signs are that next twenty years will bring about some noteworthy changes valley direction increased population wealth intellectual advancement liberalizing opinion which go naturally with these yet if one may judge by past river towns will manage find use chance here there cripple retard their progress they kept themselves back days steamboating supremacy by system wharfage dues so stupidly graded as prohibit what may be called small retail traffic freights passengers boats were charged such heavy wharfage that they could not afford land for one or two passengers or light lot freight instead encouraging bringing trade their doors towns diligently effectively discouraged it they could have had many boats low rates but their policy rendered few boats high rates compulsory it was policy which extended extends from new orleans st paul we had strong desire make trip up yazoo sunflower interesting region at any time but additionally interesting at this time because up there great inundation was still be seen force but we were nearly sure have wait day or more for new orleans boat on our return so we were obliged give up project here is story which i picked up on board boat that night i insert it this place merely because it is good story not because it belongs here for it doesn t it was told by passenger college professor was called surface course general conversation which began with talk about horses drifted into talk about astronomy then into talk about lynching gamblers vicksburg half century ago then into talk about dreams superstitions ended after midnight dispute over free trade protection chapter 36 professor s yarn it was early days i was not college professor then i was humble minded young land surveyor with world before me survey case anybody wanted it done i had contract survey route for great mining ditch california i was on my way thither by sea three or four weeks voyage there were good many passengers but i had very little say them reading dreaming were my passions i avoided conversation order indulge these appetites there were three professional gamblers on board rough repulsive fellows i never had any talk with them yet i could not help seeing them with some frequency for they gambled upper deck stateroom every day night my promenades i often had glimpses them through their door which stood little ajar let out surplus tobacco smoke profanity they were evil hateful presence but i had put up with it course there was one other passenger who fell under my eye good deal for he seemed determined be friendly with me i could not have gotten rid him without running some chance hurting his feelings i was far from wishing do that besides there was something engaging his countrified simplicity his beaming good nature first time i saw this mr john backus i guessed from his clothes his looks that he was grazier or farmer from backwoods some western state doubtless ohio afterward when he dropped into his personal history i discovered that he was cattle raiser from interior ohio i was so pleased with my own penetration that i warmed toward him for verifying my instinct he got dropping alongside me every day after breakfast help me make my promenade so course time his easy working jaw had told me everything about his business his prospects his family his relatives his politics fact everything that concerned backus living or dead meantime i think he had managed get out me everything i knew about my trade my tribe my purposes my prospects myself he was gentle persuasive genius this thing showed it for i was not given talking about my matters i said something about triangulation once stately word pleased his ear he inquired what it meant i explained after that he quietly inoffensively ignored my name always called me triangle what enthusiast he was cattle at bare name bull or cow his eye would light his eloquent tongue would turn itself loose as long as i would walk listen he would walk talk he knew all breeds he loved all breeds he caressed them all with his affectionate tongue i tramped along voiceless misery whilst cattle question was up when i could endure it no longer i used deftly insert scientific topic into conversation then my eye fired his faded my tongue fluttered his stopped life was joy me sadness him one day he said little hesitatingly with somewhat diffidence triangle would you mind coming down my stateroom minute have little talk on certain matter i went with him at once arrived there he put his head out glanced up down saloon warily then closed door locked it he sat down on sofa he said i m going make little proposition you if it strikes you favorable it ll be middling good thing for both us you ain t going out californy for fun nuther am i it s business ain t that so well you can do me good turn so can i you if we see fit i ve raked scraped saved considerable many years i ve got it all here he unlocked old hair trunk tumbled chaos shabby clothes aside drew short stout bag into view for moment then buried it again relocked trunk dropping his voice cautious low tone he continued she s all there round ten thousand dollars yellow boys now this is my little idea what i don t know about raising cattle ain t worth knowing there s mints money it californy well i know you know that all along line that s being surveyed there s little dabs land that they call gores that fall surveyor free gratis for nothing all you ve got do on your side is survey such way that gores will fall on good fat land then you turn em over me i stock em with cattle rolls cash i plank out your share dollars regular right along i was sorry wither his blooming enthusiasm but it could not be helped i interrupted said severely i am not that kind surveyor let us change subject mr backus it was pitiful see his confusion hear his awkward shamefaced apologies i was as much distressed as he was especially as he seemed so far from having suspected that there was anything improper his proposition so i hastened console him lead him on forget his mishap conversational orgy about cattle butchery we were lying at acapulco as we went on deck it happened luckily that crew were just beginning hoist some beeves aboard slings backus s melancholy vanished instantly with it memory his late mistake now only look at that cried he my goodness triangle what would they say it ohio wouldn t their eyes bug out see em handled like that wouldn t they though all passengers were on deck look even gamblers backus knew them all had afflicted them all with his pet topic as i moved away i saw one gamblers approach accost him then another them then third i halted waited watched conversation continued between four men it grew earnest backus drew gradually away gamblers followed kept at his elbow i was uncomfortable however as they passed me presently i heard backus say with tone persecuted annoyance but it ain t any use gentlemen i tell you again as i ve told you half dozen times before i warn t raised it i ain t going resk it i felt relieved his level head will be his sufficient protection i said myself during fortnight s run from acapulco san francisco i several times saw gamblers talking earnestly with backus once i threw out gentle warning him he chuckled comfortably said oh yes they tag around after me considerable want me play little just for amusement they say but laws me if my folks have told me once look out for that sort live stock they ve told me thousand times i reckon by bye due course we were approaching san francisco it was ugly black night with strong wind blowing but there was not much sea i was on deck alone toward ten i started below figure issued from gamblers den disappeared darkness i experienced shock for i was sure it was backus i flew down companion way looked about for him could not find him then returned deck just time catch glimpse him as he re entered that confounded nest rascality had he yielded at last i feared it what had he gone below for his bag coin possibly i drew near door full bodings it was crack i glanced saw sight that made me bitterly wish i had given my attention saving my poor cattle friend instead reading dreaming my foolish time away he was gambling worse still he was being plied with champagne was already showing some effect from it he praised cider as he called it said now that he had got taste it he almost believed he would drink it if it was spirits it was so good so ahead anything he had ever run across before surreptitious smiles at this passed from one rascal another they filled all glasses whilst backus honestly drained his bottom they pretended do same but threw wine over their shoulders i could not bear scene so i wandered forward tried interest myself sea voices wind but no my uneasy spirit kept dragging me back at quarter hour intervals always i saw backus drinking his wine fairly squarely others throwing theirs away it was painfullest night i ever spent only hope i had was that we might reach our anchorage with speed that would break up game i helped ship along all i could with my prayers at last we went booming through golden gate my pulses leaped for joy i hurried back that door glanced alas there was small room for hope backus s eyes were heavy bloodshot his sweaty face was crimson his speech maudlin thick his body sawed drunkenly about with weaving motion ship he drained another glass dregs whilst cards were being dealt he took his hand glanced at it his dull eyes lit up for moment gamblers observed it showed their gratification by hardly perceptible signs how many cards none said backus one villain named hank wiley discarded one card others three each betting began heretofore bets had been trifling dollar or two but backus started off with eagle now wiley hesitated moment then saw it went ten dollars better other two threw up their hands backus went twenty better wiley said i see that go you hundred better then smiled reached for money let it alone said backus with drunken gravity what you mean say you re going cover it cover it well i reckon i am lay another hundred on top it too he reached down inside his overcoat produced required sum oh that s your little game is it i see your raise raise it five hundred said wiley five hundred better said foolish bull driver pulled out amount showered it on pile three conspirators hardly tried conceal their exultation all diplomacy pretense were dropped now sharp exclamations came thick fast yellow pyramid grew higher higher at last ten thousand dollars lay view wiley cast bag coin on table said with mocking gentleness five thousand dollars better my friend from rural districts what do you say now i call you said backus heaving his golden shot bag on pile what have you got four kings you d d fool wiley threw down his cards surrounded stakes with his arms four aces you ass thundered backus covering his man with cocked revolver i m professional gambler myself i ve been laying for you duffers all this voyage down went anchor rumbledy dum dum long trip was ended well well it is sad world one three gamblers was backus s pal it was he that dealt fateful hands according understanding with two victims he was have given backus four queens but alas he didn t week later i stumbled upon backus arrayed height fashion montgomery street he said cheerily as we were parting ah by way you needn t mind about those gores i don t really know anything about cattle except what i was able pick up week s apprenticeship over jersey just before we sailed my cattle culture cattle enthusiasm have served their turn i shan t need them any more next day we reluctantly parted from gold dust her officers hoping see that boat all those officers again some day thing which fates were render tragically impossible chapter 37 end gold dust for three months later august 8 while i was writing one these foregoing chapters new york papers brought this telegram terrible disaster seventeen persons killed by explosion on steamer gold dust nashville aug 7 despatch from hickman ky says steamer gold dust exploded her boilers at three o clock day just after leaving hickman forty seven persons were scalded seventeen are missing boat was landed eddy just above town through exertions citizens cabin passengers officers part crew deck passengers were taken ashore removed hotels residences twenty four injured were lying holcomb s dry goods store at one time where they received every attention before being removed more comfortable places list names followed whereby it appeared that seventeen dead one was barkeeper among forty seven wounded were captain chief mate second mate second third clerks also mr lem s gray pilot several members crew answer private telegram we learned that none these was severely hurt except mr gray letters received afterward confirmed this news said that mr gray was improving would get well later letters spoke less hopefully his case finally came one announcing his death good man most companionable manly man worthy kindlier fate chapter 38 house beautiful we took passage cincinnati boat for new orleans or on cincinnati boat either is correct former is eastern form putting it latter western mr dickens declined agree that mississippi steamboats were magnificent or that they were floating palaces terms which had always been applied them terms which did not over express admiration with which people viewed them mr dickens s position was unassailable possibly people s position was certainly unassailable if mr dickens was comparing these boats with crown jewels or with taj or with matterhorn or with some other priceless or wonderful thing which he had seen they were not magnificent he was right people compared them with what they had seen thus measured thus judged boats were magnificent term was correct one it was not at all too strong people were as right as was mr dickens steamboats were finer than anything on shore compared with superior dwelling houses first class hotels valley they were indubitably magnificent they were palaces few people living new orleans st louis they were not magnificent perhaps not palaces but great majority those populations entire populations spread over both banks between baton rouge st louis they were palaces they tallied with citizen s dream what magnificence was satisfied it every town village along that vast stretch double river frontage had best

occupied by vast sand bar thickly covered with young trees growth which will magnify itself into dense forest by bye completely hide exiled town due time we passed grand gulf rodney war fame reached natchez last beautiful hill cities for baton rouge yet come is not on hill but only on high ground famous natchez under hill has not changed notably twenty years outward aspect judging by descriptions ancient procession foreign tourists it has not changed sixty for it is still small straggling shabby it had desperate reputation morally old keel boating early steamboating times plenty drinking carousing fisticuffing killing there among riff raff river those days but natchez on top hill is attractive has always been attractive even mrs trollope 1827 had confess its charms at one or two points wearisome level line is relieved by bluffs as they call short intervals high ground town natchez is beautifully situated on one those high spots contrast that its bright green hill forms with dismal line black forest that stretches on every side abundant growth pawpaw palmetto orange copious variety sweet scented flowers that flourish there all make it appear like oasis desert natchez is furthest point north at which oranges ripen open air or endure winter without shelter with exception this sweet spot i thought all little towns villages we passed wretched looking extreme natchez like her near far river neighbors has railways now is adding them pushing them hither thither into all rich outlying regions that are naturally tributary her like vicksburg new orleans she has her ice factory she makes thirty tons ice day vicksburg natchez my time ice was jewelry none but rich could wear it but anybody everybody can have it now i visited one ice factories new orleans see what polar regions might look like when lugged into edge tropics but there was nothing striking aspect place it was merely spacious house with some innocent steam machinery one end it some big porcelain pipes running here there no not porcelain they merely seemed be they were iron but ammonia which was being breathed through them had coated them thickness your hand with solid milk white ice it ought have melted for one did not require winter clothing that atmosphere but it did not melt inside pipe was too cold sunk into floor were numberless tin boxes foot square two feet long open at top end these were full clear water around each box salt other proper stuff was packed also ammonia gases were applied water some way which will always remain secret me because i was not able understand process while water boxes gradually froze men gave it stir or two with stick occasionally liberate air bubbles i think other men were continually lifting out boxes whose contents had become hard frozen they gave box single dip into vat boiling water melt block ice free from its tin coffin then they shot block out upon platform car it was ready for market these big blocks were hard solid crystal clear

cool tropical air also be ornamental for flowers things imprisoned them could be seen as through plate glass i was told that this factory could retail its ice by wagon throughout new orleans humblest dwelling house quantities at six or seven dollars ton make sufficient profit this being case there is business for ice factories north for we get ice on no such terms there if one take less than three

mississippi river are great strange yet were be expected but i was not expecting live see natchez these other river towns become manufacturing strongholds railway centers speaking manufactures reminds me talk upon that topic which i heard which i overheard on board cincinnati boat i awoke out fretted sleep with dull confusion voices my ears i listened two men were talking subject apparently great inundation i looked out through open transom two men were eating late breakfast sitting opposite each other nobody else around they closed up inundation with few words having used it evidently as mere ice breaker acquaintanceship breeder then they dropped into business it soon transpired that they were drummers one belonging cincinnati other new orleans brisk men energetic movement speech dollar their god how get it their religion now as this article said cincinnati slashing into ostensible butter holding forward slab it on his knife blade it s from our house look at it smell it taste it put any test on it you want take your own time no hurry make it thorough there now what do you say butter ain t it not by thundering sight it s oleomargarine yes sir that s what it is oleomargarine you

competition butter s had its day from this out butter goes wall there s more money oleomargarine than why you can t imagine business we do i ve stopped every town from cincinnati natchez i ve sent home big orders from every one them so forth so on for ten minutes longer same fervid strain then new orleans piped up said yes it s first rate imitation that s certainty but it ain t only one around that s first rate for instance they make olive oil out cotton seed oil nowadays so that you can t tell them apart yes that s so responded cincinnati it was tip top business for while they sent it over brought it back from france italy with united states custom house mark on it indorse it for genuine there was no end cash it but france italy broke up game course they naturally would cracked on such rattling impost that cotton seed olive oil couldn t stand raise had hang up quit oh it did did it you wait here minute goes his state room brings back couple long bottles takes out corks says there

paradise wide river hence new orleans abundance water from shore shore no bars snags sawyers or wrecks his road sir walter scott is probably responsible for capitol building for it is not conceivable that this little sham castle would ever have been built if he had not run people mad couple generations ago with his medieval romances south has not yet recovered from debilitating influence his books admiration his fantastic heroes their grotesque chivalry doings romantic juvenilities still survives here atmosphere which is already perceptible wholesome practical nineteenth century smell cotton factories locomotives traces its inflated language other windy humbuggeries survive along with it it is pathetic enough that whitewashed castle with turrets things materials all ungenuine within without pretending be what they are not should ever have been built this otherwise honorable place but it is much more pathetic see this architectural falsehood undergoing restoration perpetuation our day when it would have been so easy let dynamite finish what charitable fire began then devote this restoration money building something genuine baton rouge has no patent on imitation castles however no monopoly them here is picture from advertisement female institute columbia tennessee following remark is from same advertisement institute building has long been famed as model striking beautiful

distances that broad river lying between two rows becomes sort spacious street most home like happy looking region now then you see pillared porticoed great manor house embowered trees here is testimony one or two procession foreign tourists that filed along here half century ago mrs trollope says unbroken flatness banks mississippi continued unvaried for many miles above new orleans but graceful luxuriant palmetto dark noble ilex bright orange were everywhere be seen it was many days before we were weary looking at them captain basil hall district country which lies adjacent mississippi lower parts louisiana is everywhere thickly peopled by sugar planters whose showy houses gay piazzas trig gardens numerous slave villages all clean neat gave exceedingly thriving air river scenery all procession paint attractive picture same way descriptions fifty years ago do not need have word changed order exactly describe same region as it appears day except as trigness houses whitewash is gone from negro cabins now many possibly most big mansions once so shining white have worn out their paint have decayed neglected look it is blight war twenty one years ago everything was trim trig bright along coast just as it had been 1827 as described by those tourists unfortunate tourists people humbugged them with stupid silly lies then laughed at them for believing printing same they told mrs trollope that alligators or crocodiles as she calls them were terrible creatures backed up statement with blood curdling account how one these slandered reptiles crept into squatter cabin one night ate up woman five children woman by herself would have satisfied any ordinarily impossible alligator but no these liars must make him gorge five children besides one would not imagine that jokers this robust breed would be sensitive but they were it is difficult at this day understand impossible justify reception which book grave honest intelligent gentle manly charitable well meaning capt basil hall got chapter 41 metropolis south approaches new orleans were familiar general aspects were unchanged when one goes flying through london along railway propped air on tall arches he may inspect miles upper bedrooms through open windows but lower half houses is under his level out sight similarly high river stage new orleans region water is up top enclosing levee rim flat country behind it lies low representing bottom dish as boat swims along high on flood one looks down upon houses into upper windows there is nothing but that frail breastwork earth between people destruction old brick salt warehouses clustered at upper end city looked as they had always looked warehouses which had had kind aladdin s lamp experience however since i had seen them for when war broke out proprietor went bed one night leaving them packed with thousands sacks vulgar salt worth couple dollars sack got up morning found his mountain salt turned into mountain gold so speak so suddenly so dizzy height had war news sent up price article vast reach plank wharves remained unchanged there were as many ships as ever but long array steamboats had vanished not altogether course but not much it was left city itself had not changed eye it had greatly increased spread population but look town was not altered dust waste paper littered was still deep streets deep trough like gutters alongside curbstones were still half full reposeful water with dusty surface sidewalks were still sugar bacon region encumbered by casks barrels hogsheads great blocks austerely plain commercial houses were as dusty looking as ever canal street was finer more attractive stirring than formerly with its drifting crowds people its several processions hurrying street cars toward evening its broad second story verandas crowded with gentlemen ladies clothed according latest mode not that there is any architecture canal street speak broad general terms there is no architecture new orleans except cemeteries it seems strange thing say wealthy far seeing energetic city quarter million inhabitants but it is true there is huge granite u s custom house costly enough genuine enough but as decoration it is inferior gasometer it looks like state prison but it was built before war architecture america may be said have been born since war new orleans i believe has had good luck sense bad luck have had no great fire late years it must be so if opposite had been case i think one would be able tell burnt district by radical improvement its architecture over old forms one can do this boston chicago burnt district boston was commonplace before fire but now there is no commercial district any city world that can surpass it or perhaps even rival it beauty elegance tastefulness however new orleans has begun just this moment as one may say when completed new cotton exchange will be stately beautiful building massive substantial full architectural graces no shams or false pretenses or uglinesses about it anywhere city it will be worth many times its cost for it will breed its species what has been lacking hitherto was model build toward something educate eye taste suggester so speak city is well outfitted with progressive men thinking sagacious long headed men contrast between spirit city city s architecture is like contrast between waking sleep apparently there is boom everything but that one dead feature water gutters used be stagnant slimy potent disease breeder but gutters are flushed now two or three times day by powerful machinery many gutters water never stands still but has steady current other sanitary improvements have been made with such effect that new orleans claims be during long intervals between occasional yellow fever assaults one healthiest cities union there s plenty ice now for everybody manufactured town it is driving place commercially has great river ocean railway business at date our visit it was best lighted city union electrically speaking new orleans electric lights were more numerous than those new york very much better one had this modified noonday not only canal some neighboring chief streets but all along stretch five miles river frontage there are good clubs city now several them but recently organized inviting modern style pleasure resorts at west end spanish fort telephone is everywhere one most notable advances is journalism newspapers as i remember them were not striking feature now they are money is spent upon them with free hand they get news let it cost what it may editorial work is not hack grinding but literature as example new orleans journalistic achievement it may be mentioned that times democrat august 26 1882 contained report year s business towns mississippi valley from new orleans all way st paul two thousand miles that issue paper consisted forty pages seven columns page two hundred eighty columns all fifteen hundred words column aggregate four hundred twenty thousand words that is say not much short three times as many words as there are this book one may with sorrow contrast this with architecture new orleans i have been speaking public architecture only domestic article new orleans is reproachless notwithstanding it remains as it always was all dwellings are wood american part town i mean all have comfortable look those wealthy quarter are spacious painted snow white usually generally have wide verandas or double verandas supported by ornamental columns these mansions stand center large grounds rise garlanded with roses out midst swelling masses shining green foliage many colored blossoms no houses could well be better harmony with their surroundings or more pleasing eye or more home like comfortable looking one even becomes reconciled cistern presently this is mighty cask painted green sometimes couple stories high which is propped against house corner on stilts there is mansion brewery suggestion about combination which seems very incongruous at first but people cannot have wells so they take rain water neither can they conveniently have cellars or graves footnote israelites are buried graves by permission i take it not requirement but none else except destitute who are buried at public expense graves are but three or four feet deep town being built upon made ground so they do without both few living complain none others chapter 42 hygiene sentiment they bury their dead vaults above ground these vaults have resemblance houses sometimes temples are built marble generally are architecturally graceful shapely they face walks driveways cemetery when one moves through midst thousand or so them sees their white roofs gables stretching into distance on every hand phrase city

are be seen at portals many vaults placed there by pious hands bereaved parents children husbands wives renewed daily milder form sorrow finds its inexpensive lasting remembrancer coarse ugly but indestructible immortelle which is wreath or cross or some such emblem made rosettes black linen with sometimes yellow rosette at conjunction cross s bars kind sorrowful breast pin so say immortelle requires no attention you just hang it up there you are just leave it alone it will take care your grief for you keep it mind better than you can stands weather first rate lasts like boiler iron on sunny days pretty little chameleons gracefullest legged reptiles creep along marble fronts vaults catch flies their changes color as variety are not up creature s reputation they change color when person comes along hangs up immortelle but that is nothing any right feeling reptile would do that i will gradually drop this subject graveyards i have been trying all i could get down sentimental part it but i cannot accomplish it i think there is no genuinely sentimental part it it is all grotesque ghastly horrible graveyards may have been justifiable bygone ages when nobody knew that for every dead body put into ground glut earth plant roots air with disease germs five or fifty or maybe hundred persons must die before their proper time but they are hardly justifiable now when even children know that dead saint enters upon century long career assassination moment earth closes over his corpse it is grim sort thought relics st anne up canada have now after nineteen hundred years gone curing sick by dozen but it is merest matter course that these same relics within generation after st anne s death burial made several thousand people sick therefore these miracle performances are simply compensation nothing more st anne is somewhat slow pay for saint it is true but better debt paid after nineteen hundred years outlawed by statute limitations than not paid at all most knights halo do not pay at all where you find one that pays like st anne you find hundred fifty that take benefit statute none them pay any more than principal what they owe they pay none interest either simple or compound saint can never quite return principal however for his dead body kills people whereas his relics heal only they never restore dead life that part account is always left

author grandissimes him south has found masterly delineator its interior life its history truth i find by experience that untrained eye vacant mind can inspect it learn it judge it more clearly profitably his books than by personal contact with it with mr cable along see for you describe explain illuminate jog through that old quarter is vivid pleasure you have vivid sense as unseen or dimly seen things vivid yet fitful darkling you glimpse salient features but lose fine shades or catch them imperfectly through vision imagination case as it were ignorant near sighted stranger traversing rim wide vague horizons alps with inspired enlightened long sighted native we visited old st louis hotel now occupied by municipal offices there is nothing strikingly remarkable about it but one can say it as academy music new york that if broom or shovel has ever been used it there is no circumstantial evidence back up fact it is curious that cabbages hay things do not grow academy music but no doubt it is on account interruption light by benches impossibility hoeing crop except aisles fact that ushers grow their buttonhole bouquets on premises shows what might be done if they had right kind agricultural head establishment we visited also venerable cathedral pretty square front it one dim with religious light other brilliant with worldly sort lovely with orange trees blossomy shrubs then we drove hot sun through wilderness houses out on wide dead level beyond where villas are water wheels drain town commons populous with cows children passing by old cemetery where we were told lie ashes early pirate but we took him on trust did not visit him he was pirate with tremendous sanguinary history as long as he preserved unspotted retirement dignity his name grandeur his ancient calling homage reverence were his from high low but when at last he descended into politics became paltry alderman public shook him turned aside wept when he died they set up monument over him little by little he has come into respect again but it is respect for pirate not alderman day loyal generous remember only what he was charitably forget what he became thence we drove few miles across swamp along raised shell road with canal on one hand dense wood on other here there distance ragged angular limbed moss bearded cypress top standing out clear cut against sky as quaint form as apple trees japanese pictures such was our course surroundings it there was occasional alligator swimming comfortably along canal occasional picturesque colored person on bank flinging his statue rigid reflection upon still water watching for bite by bye we reached west end collection hotels usual light summer resort pattern with broad verandas all around waves wide blue lake pontchartrain lapping thresholds we had dinner on ground veranda over water chief dish renowned fish called pompano delicious as less criminal forms sin thousands people come by rail carriage west end spanish fort every evening dine listen bands take strolls open air under electric lights go sailing on lake entertain themselves various sundry other ways we had opportunities on other days other places test pompano notably at editorial dinner at one clubs city he was his last possible perfection there justified his fame his suite was tall pyramid scarlet cray fish large ones as large as one s thumb delicate palatable appetizing also deviled whitebait also shrimps choice quality platter small soft shell crabs most superior breed other dishes were what one might get at delmonico s or buckingham palace those i have spoken can be had similar perfection new orleans only i suppose west south they have new institution broom brigade it is composed young ladies who dress uniform costume go through infantry drill with broom place musket it is very pretty sight on private view when they perform on stage theater blaze colored fires it must be fine fascinating spectacle i saw them go through their complex manual with grace spirit admirable precision i saw them do everything which human being can possibly do with broom except sweep i did not see them sweep but i know they could learn what they have already learned proves that if they ever should learn should go on war path down tchoupitoulas or some those other streets around there those thoroughfares would bear greatly improved aspect very few minutes but girls themselves wouldn t so nothing would be really gained after all drill was washington artillery building this building we saw many interesting relics war also fine oil painting representing stonewall jackson s last interview with general lee both men are on horseback jackson has just ridden up is accosting lee picture is very valuable on account portraits which are authentic but like many another historical picture it means nothing without its label one label will fit it as well as another first interview between lee jackson last interview between lee jackson jackson introducing himself lee jackson accepting lee s invitation dinner jackson declining lee s invitation dinner with thanks jackson apologizing for heavy defeat jackson reporting great victory jackson asking lee for match it tells one story sufficient one for it says quite plainly satisfactorily here are lee jackson together artist would have made it tell that this is lee jackson s last interview if he could have done it but he couldn t for there wasn t any way do it good legible label is usually worth for information ton significant attitude expression historical picture rome people with fine sympathetic natures stand up weep front celebrated beatrice cenci day before her execution it shows what label can do if they did not know picture they would inspect it unmoved say young girl with hay fever young girl with her head bag i found half forgotten southern intonations elisions as pleasing my ear as they had formerly been southerner talks music at least it is music me but then i was born south educated southerner has no use for r except at beginning word he says honah dinnah gove nuh befo waw so on words may lack charm eye print but they have it ear when did r disappear from southern speech how did it come disappear custom dropping it was not borrowed from north nor inherited from england many southerners most southerners put y into occasional words that begin with k sound for instance they say mr k yahtah carter speak playing k yahds or riding k yahs they have pleasant custom long ago fallen into decay north frequently employing respectful sir instead curt yes abrupt no they say yes suh no suh but there are some infelicities such as like for as addition at where it isn t needed i heard educated gentleman say like flag officer did his cook or his butler would have said like flag officer done you hear gentlemen say where have you been at here is aggravated form heard ragged street arab say it comrade i was ask n tom whah you was sett n at very elect carelessly say will when they mean shall many them say i didn t go do it meaning i didn t mean do it northern word guess imported from england where it used be common now regarded by satirical englishmen as yankee original is but little used among southerners they say reckon they haven t any doesn t their language they say don t instead unpolished often use went for gone it is nearly as bad as northern hadn t ought this reminds me that remark very peculiar nature was made here my neighborhood north few days ago he hadn t ought have went how is that isn t that good deal triumph one knows orders combined this half breed s architecture without inquiring one parent northern other southern day i heard schoolmistress ask where is john gone this form is so common so nearly universal fact that if she had used whither instead where i think it would have sounded like affectation we picked up one excellent word word worth traveling new orleans get nice limber expressive handy word lagniappe they pronounce it lanny yap it is spanish so they said we discovered it at head column odds ends picayune first day heard twenty people use it second inquired what it meant third adopted it got facility swinging it fourth it has restricted meaning but i think people spread it out little when they choose it is equivalent thirteenth roll baker s dozen it is something thrown gratis for good measure custom originated spanish quarter city when child or servant buys something shop or even mayor or governor for aught i know he finishes operation by saying give me something for lagniappe shopman always responds gives child bit licorice root gives servant cheap cigar or spool thread gives governor i don t know what he gives governor support likely when you are invited drink this does occur now then new orleans you say what again no i ve had enough other party says but just this one time more this is for lagniappe when beau perceives that he is stacking his compliments trifle too high sees by young lady s countenance that edifice would have been better with top compliment left off he puts his i beg pardon no harm intended into briefer form oh that s for lagniappe if waiter restaurant stumbles spills gill coffee down back your neck he says for lagniappe sah gets you another cup without extra charge chapter 45 southern sports north one hears war mentioned social conversation once month sometimes as often as once week but as distinct subject for talk it has long ago been relieved duty there are sufficient reasons for this given dinner company six gentlemen day it can easily happen that four them possibly five were not field at all so chances are four two or five one that war will at no time during evening become topic conversation chances are still greater that if it become topic it will remain so but little while if you add six ladies company you have added six people who saw so little dread realities war that they ran out talk concerning them years ago now would soon weary war topic if you brought it up case is very different south there every man you meet was war every lady you meet saw war war is great chief topic conversation interest it is vivid constant interest other topics is fleeting mention war will wake up dull company set their tongues going when nearly any other topic would fail south war is what d is elsewhere they date from it all day long you hear things placed as having happened since waw or du waw or befo waw or right aftah waw or bout two yeahs or five yeahs or ten yeahs befo waw or aftah waw it shows how intimately every individual was visited his own person by that tremendous episode it gives inexperienced stranger better idea what vast comprehensive calamity invasion is than he can ever get by reading books at fireside at club one evening gentleman turned me said aside you notice course that we are nearly always talking about war it isn t because we haven t anything else talk about but because nothing else has so strong interest for us there is another reason war each us his own person seems have sampled all different varieties human experience as consequence you can t mention outside matter any sort but it will certainly remind some listener something that happened during war out he comes with it course that brings talk back war you may try all you want keep other subjects before house we may all join help but there can be but one result most random topic would load every man up with war reminiscences shut him up too talk would be likely stop presently because you can t talk pale inconsequentialities when you ve got crimson fact or fancy your head that you are burning fetch out poet was sitting some little distance away presently he began speak about moon gentleman who had been talking me remarked aside there moon is far enough from seat war but you will see that it will suggest something somebody about war ten minutes from now moon as topic will be shelved poet was saying he had noticed something which was surprise him had had impression that down here toward equator moonlight was much stronger brighter than up north had had impression that when he visited new orleans many years ago moon interruption from other end room let me explain that reminds me anecdote everything is changed since war for better or for worse but you ll find people down here born grumblers who see no change except change for worse there was old negro woman this sort young new yorker said her presence what wonderful moon you have down here she sighed said ah bless yo heart honey you ought seen dat moon befo de waw new topic was dead already but poet resurrected it gave it new start brief dispute followed as whether difference between northern southern moonlight really existed or was only imagined moonlight talk drifted easily into talk about artificial methods dispelling darkness then somebody remembered that when farragut advanced upon port hudson on dark night did not wish assist aim confederate gunners he carried no battle lanterns but painted decks his ships white thus created dim but valuable light which enabled his own men grope their way around with considerable facility at this point war got floor again ten minutes not quite up yet i was not sorry for war talk by men who have been war is always interesting whereas moon talk by poet who has not been moon is likely be dull we went cockpit new orleans on saturday afternoon i had never seen cock fight before there were men boys there all ages all colors many languages nationalities but i noticed one quite conspicuous surprising absence traditional brutal faces there were no brutal faces with no cock fighting going on you could have played gathering on stranger for prayer meeting after it began for revival provided you blindfolded your stranger for shouting was something prodigious negro white man were ring everybody else outside cocks were brought sacks when time was called they were taken out by two bottle holders stroked caressed poked toward each other finally liberated big black cock plunged instantly at little gray one struck him on head with his spur gray responded with spirit then babel many tongued shoutings broke out ceased not thenceforth when cocks had been fighting some little time i was expecting them momently drop dead for both were blind red with blood so exhausted that they frequently fell down yet they would not give up neither would they die negro white man would pick them up every few seconds wipe them off blow cold water on them fine spray take their heads their mouths hold them there moment warm back perishing life perhaps i do not know then being set down again dying creatures would totter gropingly about with dragging wings find each other strike guesswork blow or two fall exhausted once more i did not see end battle i forced myself endure it as long as i could but it was too pitiful sight so i made frank confession that effect we retired we heard afterward that black cock died ring fighting last evidently there is abundant fascination about this sport for such as have had degree familiarity with it i never saw people enjoy anything more than this gathering enjoyed this fight case was same with old gray heads with boys ten they lost themselves frenzies delight cocking main is inhuman sort entertainment there is no question about that still it seems much more respectable far less cruel sport than fox hunting for cocks like it they experience as well as confer enjoyment which is not fox s case we assisted french sense at mule race one day i believe i enjoyed this contest more than any other mule there i enjoyed it more than i remember having enjoyed any other animal race i ever saw grand stand was well filled with beauty chivalry new orleans that phrase is not original with me it is southern reporter s he has used it for two generations he uses it twenty times day or twenty thousand times day or million times day according exigencies he is obliged use it million times day if he have occasion speak respectable men women that often for he has no other phrase for such service except that single one he never tires it it always has fine sound him there is kind swell medieval bulliness tinsel about it that pleases his gaudy barbaric soul if he had been palestine early times we should have had no references much people out him no he would have said beauty chivalry galilee assembled hear sermon on mount it is likely that men women south are sick enough that phrase by this time would like change but there is no immediate prospect their getting it new orleans editor has strong compact direct unflowery style wastes no words does not gush not so with his average correspondent appendix i have quoted good letter penned by trained hand but average correspondent hurls style which differs from that for instance times democrat sent relief steamer up one bayous last april this steamer landed at village up there somewhere captain invited some ladies village make short trip with him they accepted came aboard steamboat shoved out up creek that was all there was it that is all that editor times democrat would have got out it there was nothing thing but statistics he would have got nothing else out it he would probably have even tabulated them partly secure perfect clearness statement partly save space but his special correspondent knows other methods handling statistics he just throws off all restraint wallows them on saturday early morning beauty place graced our cabin proud her fair freight gallant little boat glided up bayou twenty two words say ladies came aboard boat shoved out up creek is clean waste ten good words is also destructive compactness statement trouble with southern reporter is women they unsettle him they throw him off his balance he is plain sensible satisfactory until woman heaves sight then he goes all pieces his mind totters he becomes flowery idiotic from reading above extract you would imagine that this student sir walter scott is apprentice knows next nothing about handling pen on contrary he furnishes plenty proofs his long letter that he knows well enough how handle it when women are not around give him artificial flower complaint for instance at 4 o clock ominous clouds began gather south east presently from gulf there came blow which increased severity every moment it was not safe leave landing then there was delay oaks shook off long tresses their mossy beards tugging wind bayou its ambition put on miniature waves mocking much larger bodies water lull permitted start homewards we steamed inky sky overhead heavy wind blowing as darkness crept on there were few on board who did not wish themselves nearer home there is nothing matter with that it is good description compactly put yet there was great temptation there drop into lurid writing but let us return mule since i left him i have rummaged around found full report race it i find confirmation theory which i broached just now namely that trouble with southern reporter is women women supplemented by walter scott his knights beauty chivalry so on this is excellent report as long as women stay out it but when they intrude we have this frantic result it will be probably long time before ladies stand presents such sea foam like loveliness as it did yesterday new orleans women are always charming but never so much so as at this time year when their dainty spring costumes they bring with them breath balmy freshness odor sanctity unspeakable stand was so crowded with them that walking at their feet seeing no possibility approach many man appreciated as he never did before peri s feeling at gates paradise wondered what was priceless boon that would admit him their sacred presence sparkling on their white robed breasts or shoulders were colors their favorite knights were it not for fact that doughty heroes appeared on unromantic mules it would have been easy imagine one king arthur s gala days there were thirteen mules first heat all sorts mules they were all sorts complexions gaits dispositions aspects some were handsome creatures some were not some were sleek some hadn t had their fur brushed lately some were innocently gay frisky some were full malice all unrighteousness guessing from looks some them thought matter on hand was war some thought it was lark rest took it for religious occasion each mule acted according his convictions result was absence harmony well compensated by conspicuous presence variety variety picturesque entertaining sort all riders were young gentlemen fashionable society if reader has been wondering why it is that ladies new orleans attend so humble orgy as mule race thing is explained now it is fashion freak all connected with it are people fashion it is great fun cordially liked mule race is one marked occasions year it has brought some pretty fast mules front one these had be ruled out because he was so fast that he turned thing into one mule contest robbed it one its best features variety but every now then somebody disguises him with new name new complexion rings him again riders dress full jockey costumes bright colored silks satins velvets thirteen mules got away body after couple false starts scampered off with prodigious spirit as each mule each rider had distinct opinion his own as how race ought be run which side track was best certain circumstances how often track ought be crossed when collision ought be accomplished when it ought be avoided these twenty six conflicting opinions created most fantastic picturesque confusion resulting spectacle was killingly comical mile heat time 2 22 eight thirteen mules distanced i had bet on mule which would have won if procession had been reversed second heat was good fun so was consolation race for beaten mules which followed later but first heat was best that respect i think that much most enjoyable all races is steamboat race but next that i prefer gay joyous mule rush two red hot steamboats raging along neck neck straining every nerve that is say every rivet boilers quaking shaking groaning from stem stern spouting white steam from pipes pouring black smoke from chimneys raining down sparks parting river into long breaks hissing foam this is sport that makes body s very liver curl with enjoyment horse race is pretty tame colorless comparison still horse race might be well enough its way perhaps if it were not for tiresome false starts but then nobody is ever killed at least nobody was ever killed when i was at horse race they have been crippled it is true but this is little purpose chapter 46 enchantments enchanters largest annual event new orleans is something which we arrived too late sample mardi gras festivities i saw procession mystic crew comus there twenty four years ago with knights nobles so on clothed silken golden paris made gorgeousnesses planned bought for that single night s use their train all manner giants dwarfs monstrosities other diverting grotesquerie startling wonderful sort show as it filed solemnly silently down street light its smoking flickering torches but it is said that these latter days spectacle is mightily augmented as cost splendor variety there is chief personage rex if i remember rightly neither this king nor any his great following subordinates is known any outsider all these people are gentlemen position consequence it is proud thing belong organization so mystery which they hide their personality is merely for romance s sake not on account police mardi gras is course relic french spanish occupation but i judge that religious feature has been pretty well knocked out it now sir walter has got advantage gentlemen cowl rosary he will stay his medieval business supplemented by monsters oddities pleasant creatures from fairy land is finer look at than poor fantastic inventions performances reveling rabble priest s day serves quite as well perhaps emphasize day admonish men that grace line between worldly season holy one is reached this mardi gras pageant was exclusive possession new orleans until recently but now it has spread memphis st louis baltimore it has probably reached its limit it is thing which could hardly exist practical north would certainly last but very brief time as brief time as it would last london for soul it is romantic not funny grotesque take away romantic mysteries kings knights big sounding titles mardi gras would die down there south very feature that keeps it alive south girly girly romance would kill it north or london puck punch press universal would fall upon it make merciless fun it its first exhibition would be also its last against crimes french revolution bonaparte may be set two compensating benefactions revolution broke chains ancien regime church made nation abject slaves nation freemen bonaparte instituted setting merit above birth also so completely stripped divinity from royalty that whereas crowned heads europe were gods before they are only men since can never be gods again but only figureheads answerable for their acts like common clay such benefactions as these compensate temporary harm which bonaparte revolution did leave world debt them for these great permanent services liberty humanity progress then comes sir walter scott with his enchantments by his single might checks this wave progress even turns it back sets world love with dreams phantoms with decayed swinish forms religion with decayed degraded systems government with sillinesses emptinesses sham grandeurs sham gauds sham chivalries brainless worthless long vanished society he did measureless harm more real lasting harm perhaps than any other individual that ever wrote most world has now outlived good part these harms though by no means all them but our south they flourish pretty forcefully still not so forcefully as half generation ago perhaps but still forcefully there genuine wholesome civilization nineteenth century is curiously confused commingled with walter scott middle age sham civilization so you have practical common sense progressive ideas progressive works mixed up with duel inflated speech jejune romanticism absurd past that is dead out charity ought be buried but for sir walter disease character southerner or southron according sir walter s starchier way phrasing it would be wholly modern place modern medieval mixed south would be fully generation further advanced than it is it was sir walter that made every gentleman south major or colonel or general or judge before war it was he also that made these gentlemen value these bogus decorations for it was he that created rank caste down there also reverence for rank caste pride pleasure them enough is laid on slavery without fathering upon it these creations contributions sir walter sir walter had so large hand making southern character as it existed before war that he is great measure responsible for war it seems little harsh toward dead man say that we never should have had any war but for sir walter yet something plausible argument might perhaps be made support that wild proposition southerner american revolution owned slaves so did southerner civil war but former resembles latter as englishman resembles frenchman change character can be traced rather more easily sir walter s influence than that any other thing or person one may observe by one or two signs how deeply that influence penetrated how strongly it holds if one take up northern or southern literary periodical forty or fifty years ago he will find it filled with wordy windy flowery eloquence romanticism sentimentality all imitated from sir walter sufficiently badly done too innocent travesties his style methods fact this sort literature being fashion both sections country there was opportunity for fairest competition as consequence south was able show as many well known literary names proportioned population as north could but change has come there is no opportunity now for fair competition between north south for north has thrown out that old inflated style whereas southern writer still clings it clings it has restricted market for his wares as consequence there is as much literary talent south now as ever there was course but its work can gain but slight currency under present conditions authors write for past not present they use obsolete forms dead language but when southerner genius writes modern english his book goes upon crutches no longer but upon wings they carry it swiftly all about america england through great english reprint publishing houses germany as witness experience mr cable uncle remus two very few southern authors who do not write southern style instead three or four widely known literary names south ought have dozen or two will have them when sir walter s time is out curious exemplification power single book for good or harm is shown effects wrought by don quixote those wrought by ivanhoe first swept world s admiration for medieval chivalry silliness out existence other restored it as far as our south is concerned good work done by cervantes is pretty nearly dead letter so effectually has scott s pernicious work undermined it chapter 47 uncle remus mr cable mr joel chandler harris uncle remus was arrive from atlanta at seven o clock sunday morning so we got up received him we were able detect him among crowd arrivals at hotel counter by his correspondence with description him which had been furnished us from trustworthy source he was said be undersized red haired somewhat freckled he was only man party whose outside tallied with this bill particulars he was said be very shy he is shy man this there is no doubt it may not show on surface but shyness is there after days intimacy one wonders see that it is still about as strong force as ever there is fine beautiful nature hidden behind it as all know who have read uncle remus book fine genius too as all know by same sign i seem be talking quite freely about this neighbor but talking public i am but talking his personal friends these things are permissible among friends he deeply disappointed number children who had flocked eagerly mr cable s house get glimpse illustrious sage oracle nation s nurseries they said why he s white they were grieved about it so console them book was brought that they might hear uncle remus s tar baby story from lips uncle remus himself or what their outraged eyes was left him but it turned out that he had never read aloud people was too shy venture attempt now mr cable i read from books ours show him what easy trick it was but his immortal shyness was proof against even this sagacious strategy so we had read about brer rabbit ourselves mr harris ought be able read negro dialect better than anybody else for matter writing it he is only master country has produced mr cable is only master writing french dialects that country has produced he reads them perfection it was great treat hear him read about jean ah poquelin about innerarity his famous pigshoo representing louisihanna rif fusing hanter union along with passages nicely shaded german dialect from novel which was still manuscript it came out conversation that two different instances mr cable got into grotesque trouble by using his books next impossible french names which nevertheless happened be borne by living sensitive citizens new orleans his names were either inventions or were borrowed from ancient obsolete past i do not now remember which but at any rate living bearers them turned up were good deal hurt at having attention directed themselves their affairs so excessively public manner mr warner i had experience same sort when we wrote book called gilded age there is character it called sellers i do not remember what his first name was beginning but anyway mr warner did not like it wanted it improved he asked me if i was able imagine person named eschol sellers course i said i could not without stimulants he said that away out west once he had met contemplated actually shaken hands with man bearing that impossible name eschol sellers he added it was twenty years ago his name has probably carried him off before this if it hasn t he will never see book anyhow we will confiscate his name name you are using is common therefore dangerous there are probably thousand sellerses bearing it whole horde will come after us but eschol sellers is safe name it is rock so we borrowed that name when book had been out about week one stateliest handsomest most aristocratic looking white men that ever lived called around with most formidable libel suit his pocket that ever well brief we got his permission suppress edition ten million footnote figures taken from memory probably incorrect think it was more copies book change that name mulberry sellers future editions chapter 48 sugar postage one day on street i encountered man whom all men i

step same alertness same decision eye answering decision hand same erect military bearing not inch gained or lost girth not ounce gained or lost weight not hair turned it is curious thing leave man thirty five years old come back at end twenty one years find him still only thirty five i have not had experience this kind before i believe there were some crow s feet but they counted for next nothing since they were inconspicuous his boat was just i had been waiting several days for her purposing return st louis her captain i joined party ladies gentlemen guests major wood went down river fifty four miles swift tug ex governor warmouth s sugar plantation strung along below city were number decayed ram shackly superannuated old steamboats not one which had i ever seen before they had all been built worn out thrown aside since i was here last this gives one realizing sense frailness mississippi boat briefness its life six miles below town fat battered brick chimney sticking above magnolias live oaks was pointed out as monument erected by appreciative nation celebrate battle new orleans jackson s victory over british january 8 1815 war had ended two nations were at peace but news had not yet reached new orleans if we had had cable telegraph those days this blood would not have been spilt those lives would not have been wasted better still jackson would probably never have been president we have gotten over harms done us by war 1812 but not over some those done us by jackson s presidency warmouth plantation covers vast deal ground hospitality warmouth mansion is graduated same large scale we saw steam plows at work here for first time traction engine travels about on its own wheels till it reaches required spot then it stands still by means wire rope pulls huge plow toward itself two or three hundred yards across field between rows cane thing cuts down into black mold foot half deep plow looks like fore aft brace hudson river steamer inverted when negro steersman sits on one end it that end tilts down near ground while other sticks up high air this great see saw goes rolling pitching like ship at sea it is not every circus rider that could stay on it plantation contains two thousand six hundred acres six hundred fifty are cane there is fruitful orange grove five thousand trees cane is cultivated after modern intricate scientific fashion too elaborate complex for me attempt describe but it lost 40 000 last year i forget other details however this year s crop will reach ten or twelve hundred tons sugar consequently last year s loss will not matter these troublesome expensive scientific methods achieve yield ton half from that two tons acre which is three or four times what yield acre was my time drainage ditches were everywhere alive with little crabs fiddlers one saw them scampering sidewise every direction whenever they heard disturbing noise expensive pests these crabs for they bore into levees ruin them great sugar house was wilderness tubs tanks vats filters pumps pipes machinery process making sugar is exceedingly interesting first you heave your cane into centrifugals grind out juice then run it through evaporating pan extract fiber then through bone filter remove alcohol then through clarifying tanks discharge molasses then through granulating pipe condense it then through vacuum pan extract vacuum it is now ready for market i have jotted these particulars down from memory thing looks simple easy do not deceive yourself make sugar is really one most difficult things world make it right is next impossible if you will examine your own supply every now then for term years tabulate result you will find that not two men twenty can make sugar without getting sand into it we could have gone down mouth river visited captain eads great work jetties where river has been compressed between walls thus deepened twenty six feet but it was voted useless go since at this stage water everything would be covered up invisible we could have visited that ancient singular burg pilot town which stands on stilts water so they say where nearly all communication is by skiff canoe even attending weddings funerals where littlest boys girls are as handy with oar as unamphibious children are with velocipede we could have done number other things but on account limited time we went back home sail up breezy sparkling river was charming experience would have been satisfyingly sentimental romantic but for interruptions tug s pet parrot whose tireless comments upon scenery guests were always this worldly often profane he had also superabundance discordant ear splitting metallic laugh common his breed machine made laugh frankenstein laugh with soul left out it he applied it every sentimental remark every pathetic song he cackled it out with hideous energy after home again home again from foreign shore said he wouldn t give damn for tug load such rot romance sentiment cannot long survive this sort discouragement so singing talking presently ceased which so delighted parrot that he cursed himself hoarse for joy then male members party moved forecastle smoke gossip there were several old steamboatmen along i learned from them great deal what had been happening my former river friends during my long absence i learned that pilot whom i used steer for is become spiritualist for more than fifteen years has been receiving letter every week from deceased relative through new york spiritualist medium named manchester postage graduated by distance from local post office paradise new york five dollars from new york st louis three cents i remember mr manchester very well i called on him once ten years ago with couple friends one whom wished inquire after deceased uncle this uncle had lost his life peculiarly violent unusual way half dozen years before cyclone blew him some three miles knocked tree down with him which was four feet through at butt sixty five feet high he did not survive this triumph at seance just referred my friend questioned his late uncle through mr manchester late uncle wrote down his replies using mr manchester s hand pencil for that purpose following is fair example questions asked also sloppy twaddle way answers furnished by manchester under pretense that it came from specter if this man is not paltriest fraud that lives i owe him apology question where are you answer spirit world q are you happy very happy perfectly happy q how do you amuse yourself conversation with friends other spirits q what else nothing else nothing else is necessary q what do you talk about about how happy we are about friends left behind earth how influence them for their good q when your friends earth all get spirit land what shall you have talk about then nothing but about how happy you all are no reply it is explained that spirits will not answer frivolous questions q how is it that spirits that are content spend eternity frivolous employments accept

what i ask for you departed on certain day certain year is not this true yes q then name day month much fumbling with pencil on part medium accompanied by violent spasmodic jerkings his head body for some little time finally explanation effect that spirits often forget dates such things being without importance them q then this one has actually forgotten date its translation spirit land this was granted be case q this is very curious well then what year was it more fumbling jerking idiotic spasms on part medium finally explanation effect that spirit has forgotten year q this is indeed stupendous let me put one more question one last question you before we part meet no more for even if i fail avoid your asylum meeting there will go for nothing as meeting since by that time you will easily have forgotten me my name did you die natural death or were you cut off by catastrophe after long hesitation many throes spasms natural death this ended interview my friend told medium that when his relative was this poor world he was endowed with extraordinary intellect absolutely defectless memory it seemed great pity that he had not been allowed keep some shred these for his amusement realms everlasting contentment for amazement admiration rest population there this man had plenty clients has plenty yet he receives letters from spirits located every part spirit world delivers them all over this country through united states mail these letters are filled with advice advice from spirits who don t know as much as tadpole this advice is religiously followed by receivers one these clients was man whom spirits if one may thus plurally describe ingenious manchester were teaching how contrive improved railway car wheel it is coarse employment for spirit but it is higher wholesomer activity than talking for ever about how happy we are chapter 49 episodes pilot life course tug boat gossip it came out that out every five my former friends who had quitted river four had chosen farming as occupation course this was not because they were peculiarly gifted agriculturally thus more likely succeed as farmers than other industries reason for their choice must be traced some other source doubtless they chose farming because that life is private secluded from irruptions undesirable strangers like pilot house hermitage doubtless they also chose it because on thousand nights black storm danger they had noted twinkling lights solitary farm houses as boat swung by pictured themselves serenity security coziness such refuges at such times so had by bye come dream that retired peaceful life as one desirable thing long for anticipate earn at last enjoy but i did not learn that any these pilot farmers had astonished anybody with their successes their farms do not support them they support their farms pilot farmer disappears from river annually about breaking spring is seen no more till next frost then he appears again damaged homespun combs hayseed out his hair takes pilot house berth for winter this way he pays debts which his farming has achieved during agricultural season so his river bondage is but half broken he is still river s slave hardest half year one these men bought farm but did not retire it he knew trick worth two that he did not propose pauperize his farm by applying his personal ignorance working it no he put farm into hands agricultural expert be worked on shares out every three loads corn expert have two pilot third but at end season pilot received no corn expert explained that his share was not reached farm produced only two loads some pilots whom i had known had had adventures outcome fortunate sometimes but not all cases captain montgomery whom i had steered for when he was pilot commanded confederate fleet great battle before memphis when his vessel went down he swam ashore fought his way through squad soldiers made gallant narrow escape he was always cool man nothing could disturb his serenity once when he was captain crescent city i was bringing boat into port at new orleans momently expecting orders from hurricane deck but received none i had stopped wheels there my authority responsibility ceased it was evening dim twilight captain s hat was perched upon big bell i supposed intellectual end captain was it but such was not case captain was very strict therefore i knew better than touch bell without orders my duty was hold boat steadily on her calamitous course leave consequences take care themselves which i did so we went plowing past sterns steamboats getting closer closer crash was bound come very soon still that hat never budged for alas captain was napping texas things were becoming exceedingly nervous uncomfortable it seemed me that captain was not going appear time see entertainment but he did just as we were walking into stern steamboat he stepped out on deck said with heavenly serenity set her back on both which i did but trifle late however for next moment we went smashing through that other boat s flimsy outer works with most prodigious racket captain never said word me about matter afterwards except remark that i had done right that he hoped i would not hesitate act same way again like circumstances one pilots whom i had known when i was on river had died very honorable death his boat caught fire he remained at wheel until he got her safe land then he went out over breast board with his clothing flames was last person get ashore he died from his injuries course two or three hours his was only life lost history mississippi piloting affords six or seven instances this sort martyrdom half hundred instances escapes from like fate which came within second or two being fatally too late but there is no instance pilot deserting his post save his life while by remaining sacrificing it he might secure other lives from destruction it is well worth while set down this noble fact well worth while put it italics too cub pilot is early admonished despise all perils connected with pilot s calling prefer any sort death deep dishonor deserting his post while there is any possibility his being useful it so effectively are these admonitions inculcated that even young but half tried pilots can be depended upon stick wheel die there when occasion requires memphis graveyard is buried young fellow who perished at wheel great many years ago white river save lives other men he said captain that if fire would give him time reach sand bar some distance away all could be saved but that land against bluff bank river would be insure loss many lives he reached bar grounded boat shallow water but by that time flames had closed around him escaping through them he was fatally burned he had been urged fly sooner but had replied as became pilot reply i will not go if i go nobody will be saved if i stay no one will be lost but me i will stay there were two hundred persons on board no life was lost but pilot s there used be monument this young fellow that memphis graveyard while we tarried memphis on our down trip i started out look for it but our time was so brief that i was obliged turn back before my object was accomplished tug boat gossip informed me that dick kennet was dead blown up near memphis killed that several others whom i had known had fallen war one or two them shot down at wheel that another very particular friend whom i had steered many trips for had stepped out his house new orleans one night years ago collect some money remote part city had never been seen again was murdered thrown into river it was thought that ben thornburgh was dead long ago also his wild cub whom i used quarrel with all through every daylight watch heedless reckless creature he was always hot water always mischief arkansas passenger brought enormous bear aboard one day chained him life boat on hurricane deck thornburgh s cub could not rest till he had gone there unchained bear see what he would do he was promptly gratified bear chased him around around deck for miles miles with two hundred eager faces grinning through railings for audience finally snatched off lad s coat tail went into texas chew it off watch turned out with alacrity left bear sole possession he presently grew lonesome started out for recreation he ranged whole boat visited every part it with advance guard fleeing people front him voiceless vacancy behind him when his owner captured him at last those two were only visible beings anywhere everybody else was hiding boat was solitude i was told that one my pilot friends fell dead at wheel from heart disease 1869 captain was on roof at time he saw boat breaking for shore shouted got no answer ran up found pilot lying dead on floor mr bixby had been blown up madrid bend was not injured but other pilot was lost george ritchie had been blown up near memphis blown into river from wheel disabled water was very cold he clung cotton bale mainly with his teeth floated until nearly exhausted when he was rescued by some deck hands who were on piece wreck they tore open bale packed him cotton warmed life back into him got him safe memphis he is one bixby s pilots on baton rouge now into life steamboat clerk now dead had dropped bit romance somewhat grotesque romance but romance nevertheless when i knew him he was shiftless young spendthrift boisterous goodhearted full careless generosities pretty conspicuously promising fool his possibilities away early come nothing western city lived rich childless old foreigner his wife their family was comely young girl sort friend sort servant young clerk whom i have been speaking whose name was not george johnson but who shall be called george johnson for purposes this narrative got acquainted with this young girl they sinned old foreigner found them out rebuked them being ashamed they lied said they were married that they had been privately married then old foreigner s hurt was healed he forgave blessed them after that they were able continue their sin without concealment by bye foreigner s wife died presently he followed after her friends family assembled mourn among mourners sat two young sinners will was opened solemnly read it bequeathed every penny that old man s great wealth mrs george johnson there was no such person young sinners fled forth then did very foolish thing married themselves before obscure justice peace got him antedate thing that did no sort good distant relatives flocked exposed fraudful date with extreme suddenness surprising ease carried off fortune leaving johnsons very legitimately legally irrevocably chained together honorable marriage but with not so much as penny bless themselves withal such are actual facts not all novels have for base so telling situation chapter 50 original jacobs we had some talk about captain isaiah sellers now many years dead he was fine man high minded man greatly respected both ashore on river he was very tall well built handsome his old age as i remember him his hair was as black as indian s his eye hand were as strong steady his nerve judgment as firm clear as anybody s young or old among fraternity pilots he was patriarch craft he had been keelboat pilot before day steamboats steamboat pilot before any other steamboat pilot still surviving at time i speak had ever turned wheel consequently his brethren held him sort awe which illustrious survivors bygone age are always held by their associates he knew how he was regarded perhaps this fact added some trifle stiffening his natural dignity which had been sufficiently stiff its original state he left diary behind him but apparently it did not date back his first steamboat trip which was said be 1811 year first steamboat disturbed waters mississippi at time his death correspondent st louis republican culled following items from diary february 1825 he shipped on board steamer rambler at florence ala made during that year three trips new orleans back this on gen carrol between nashville new orleans it was during his stay on this boat that captain sellers introduced tap bell as signal heave lead previous which time it was custom for pilot speak men below when soundings were wanted proximity forecastle pilot house no doubt rendered this easy matter but how different on one our palaces present day 1827 we find him on board president boat two hundred eighty five tons burden plying between smithland new orleans thence he joined jubilee 1828 on this boat he did his first piloting st louis trade his first watch extending from herculaneum st genevieve on may 26 1836 he completed left pittsburgh charge steamer prairie boat four hundred tons first steamer with state room cabin ever seen at st louis 1857 he introduced signal for meeting boats which has with some slight change been universal custom this day fact is rendered obligatory by act congress as general items river history we quote following marginal notes from his general log march 1825 gen lafayette left new orleans for st louis on low pressure steamer natchez january 1828 twenty one steamers left new orleans wharf celebrate occasion gen jackson s visit that city 1830 north american made run from new orleans memphis six days best time on record that date it has since been made two days ten hours 1831 red river cut off formed 1832 steamer hudson made run from white river helena distance seventy five miles twelve hours this was source much talk speculation among parties directly interested 1839 great horseshoe cut off formed up present time term thirty five years we ascertain by reference diary he has made four hundred sixty round trips new orleans which gives distance one million one hundred four thousand miles or average eighty six miles day whenever captain sellers approached body gossiping pilots chill fell there talking ceased for this reason whenever six pilots were gathered together there would always be one or two newly fledged ones lot elder ones would be always showing off before these poor fellows making them sorrowfully feel how callow they were how recent their nobility how humble their degree by talking largely vaporously old time experiences on river always making it point date everything back as far as they could so as make new men feel their newness sharpest degree possible envy old stagers like degree how these complacent baldheads would swell brag lie date back ten fifteen twenty years how they did enjoy effect produced upon marveling envying youngsters perhaps just at this happy stage proceedings stately figure captain isaiah sellers that real only genuine son antiquity would drift solemnly into midst imagine size silence that would result on instant imagine feelings those bald heads exultation their recent audience when ancient captain would begin drop casual indifferent remarks reminiscent nature about islands that had disappeared cutoffs that had been made generation before oldest bald head company had ever set his foot pilot house many many time did this ancient mariner appear on scene above fashion spread disaster humiliation around him if one might believe pilots he always dated his islands back misty dawn river history he never used same island twice never did he employ island that still existed or give one name which anybody present was old enough have heard before if you might believe pilots he was always conscientiously particular about little details never spoke state mississippi for instance no he would say when state mississippi was where arkansas now is would never speak louisiana or missouri general way leave incorrect impression on your mind no he would say when louisiana was up river farther or when missouri was on illinois side old gentleman was not literary turn or capacity but he used jot down brief paragraphs plain practical information about river sign them mark twain give them new orleans picayune they related stage condition river were accurate valuable thus far they contained no poison but speaking stage river day at given point captain was pretty apt drop little remark about this being first time he had seen water so high or so low at that particular point for forty nine years now then he would mention island so so follow it parentheses with some such observation as disappeared 1807 if i remember rightly these antique interjections lay poison bitterness for other old pilots they used chaff mark twain paragraphs with unsparing mockery it so chanced that one these paragraphs footnote original ms it captain s own hand has been sent me from new orleans it reads as follows vicksburg may 4 1859 my opinion for benefit citizens new orleans water is higher this far up than it has been since 8 my opinion is that water will be feet deep canal street before first next june mrs turner s plantation at head big black island is all under water it has not been since 1815 i sellers became text for my first newspaper article i burlesqued it broadly very broadly stringing my fantastics out extent eight hundred or thousand words i was cub at time i showed my performance some pilots they eagerly rushed it into print new orleans true delta it was great pity for it did nobody any worthy service it sent pang deep into good man s heart there was no malice my rubbish but it laughed at captain it laughed at man whom such thing was new strange dreadful i did not know then though i do now that there is no suffering comparable with that which private person feels when he is for first time pilloried print captain sellers did me honor profoundly detest me from that day forth when i say he did me honor i am not using empty words it was very real honor be thoughts so great man as captain sellers i had wit enough appreciate it be proud it it was distinction be loved by such man but it was much greater distinction be hated by him because he loved scores people but he didn t sit up nights hate anybody but me he never printed another paragraph while he lived he never again signed mark twain anything at time that telegraph brought news his death i was on pacific coast i was fresh new journalist needed nom de guerre so i confiscated ancient mariner s discarded one have done my best make it remain what it was his hands sign symbol warrant that whatever is found its company may be gambled on as being petrified truth how i have succeeded it would not be modest me say captain had honorable pride his profession abiding love for it he ordered his monument before he died kept it near him until he did die it stands over his grave now bellefontaine cemetery st louis it is his image marble standing on duty at pilot wheel worthy stand confront criticism for it represents man who life would have stayed there till he burned cinder if duty required it finest thing we saw on our whole mississippi trip we saw as we approached new orleans steam tug this was curving frontage crescent city lit up with white glare five miles electric lights it was wonderful sight very beautiful chapter 51 reminiscences we left for st louis city baton rouge on delightfully hot day but with main purpose my visit but lamely accomplished i had hoped hunt up talk with hundred steamboatmen but got so pleasantly involved social life town that i got nothing more than mere five minute talks with couple dozen craft i was on bench pilot house when we backed out straightened up for start boat pausing for good ready old fashioned way black smoke piling out chimneys equally old fashioned way then we began gather momentum presently were fairly under way booming along it was all as natural familiar so were shoreward sights as if there had been no break my river life there was cub i judged that he would take wheel now he did captain bixby stepped into pilot house presently cub closed up on rank steamships he made me nervous for he allowed too much water show between our boat ships i knew quite well what was going happen because i could date back my own life inspect record captain looked on during silent half minute then took wheel himself crowded boat till she went scraping along within hand breadth ships it was exactly favor which he had done me about quarter century before that same spot first time i ever steamed out port new orleans it was very great sincere pleasure me see thing repeated with somebody else as victim we made natchez three hundred miles twenty two hours half much swiftest passage i have ever made over that piece water next morning i came on with four o clock watch saw ritchie successfully run half dozen crossings fog using for his guidance marked chart devised patented by bixby himself this sufficiently evidenced great value chart by by when fog began clear off i noticed that reflection tree smooth water overflowed bank six hundred yards away was stronger blacker than ghostly tree itself faint spectral trees dimly glimpsed through shredding fog were very pretty things see we had heavy thunder storm at natchez another at vicksburg still another about fifty miles below memphis they had old fashioned energy which had long been unfamiliar me this third storm was accompanied by raging wind we tied up bank when we saw tempest coming everybody left pilot house but me wind bent young trees down exposing pale underside leaves gust after gust followed quick succession thrashing branches violently up down this side that creating swift waves alternating green white according side leaf that was exposed these waves raced after each other as do their kind over wind tossed field oats no color that was visible anywhere was quite natural all tints were charged with leaden tinge from solid cloud bank overhead river was leaden all distances same even far reaching ranks combing white caps were dully shaded by dark rich atmosphere through which their swarming legions marched thunder peals were constant deafening explosion followed explosion with but inconsequential intervals between reports grew steadily sharper higher keyed more trying ear lightning was as diligent as thunder produced effects which enchanted eye sent electric ecstasies mixed delight apprehension shivering along every nerve body unintermittent procession rain poured down amazing volume ear splitting thunder peals broke nearer nearer wind increased fury began wrench off boughs tree tops send them sailing away through space pilot house fell rocking straining cracking surging i went down hold see what time it was people boast good deal about alpine thunderstorms but storms which i have had luck see alps were not equals some which i have seen mississippi valley i may not have seen alps do their best course if they can beat mississippi i don t wish on this up trip i saw little towhead infant island half mile long which had been formed during past nineteen years since there was so much time spare that nineteen years it could be devoted construction mere towhead where was use originally rushing this whole globe through six days it is likely that if more time had been taken first place world would have been made right this ceaseless improving repairing would not be necessary now but if you hurry world or house you are nearly sure find out by by that you have left out towhead or broom closet or some other little convenience here there which has got be supplied no matter how much expense vexation it may cost we had succession black nights going up river it was observable that whenever we landed suddenly inundated trees with intense sunburst electric light certain curious effect was always produced hundreds birds flocked instantly out from masses shining green foliage went careering hither thither through white rays often song bird tuned up fell singing we judged that they mistook this superb artificial day for genuine article we had delightful trip that thoroughly well ordered steamer regretted that it was accomplished so speedily by means diligence activity we managed hunt out nearly all old friends one was missing however he went his reward whatever it was two years ago but i found out all about him his case helped me realize how lasting can be effect very trifling occurrence when he was apprentice blacksmith our village i schoolboy couple young englishmen came town sojourned while one day they got themselves up cheap royal finery did richard iii swordfight with maniac energy prodigious powwow presence village boys this blacksmith cub was there histrionic poison entered his bones this vast lumbering ignorant dull witted lout was stage struck irrecoverably he disappeared presently turned up st louis i ran across him there by by he was standing musing on street corner with his left hand on his hip thumb his right supporting his chin face bowed frowning slouch hat pulled down over his forehead imagining himself be othello or some such character imagining that passing crowd marked his tragic bearing were awestruck i joined him tried get him down out clouds but did not succeed however he casually informed me presently that he was member walnut street theater company he tried say it with indifference but indifference was thin mighty exultation showed through it he said he was cast for part julius caesar for that night if i should come i would see him if i should come i said i wouldn t miss it if i were dead i went away stupefied with astonishment saying myself how strange it is we always thought this fellow fool yet moment he comes great city where intelligence appreciation abound talent concealed this shabby napkin is at once discovered promptly welcomed honored but i came away from theater that night disappointed offended for i had had no glimpse my hero his name was not bills i met him on street next morning before i could speak he asked did you see me no you weren t there he looked surprised disappointed he said yes i was indeed i was i was roman soldier which one why didn t you see them roman soldiers that stood back there rank sometimes marched procession around stage do you mean roman army those six sandaled roustabouts nightshirts with tin shields helmets that marched around treading on each other s heels charge spider legged consumptive dressed like themselves that s it that s it i was one them roman soldiers i was next last one half year ago i used always be last one but i ve been promoted well they told me that that poor fellow remained roman soldier last matter thirty four years sometimes they cast him for speaking part but not elaborate one he could be trusted go say my lord carriage waits but if they ventured add sentence or two this his memory felt strain he was likely miss fire yet poor devil he had been patiently studying part hamlet for more than thirty years he lived died belief that some day he would be invited play it this is what came that fleeting visit those young englishmen our village such ages ages ago what noble horseshoes this man might have made but for those englishmen what inadequate roman soldier he did make day or two after we reached st louis i was walking along fourth street when grizzly headed man gave sort start as he passed me then stopped came back inspected me narrowly with clouding brow finally said with deep asperity look here have you got that drink yet maniac i judged at first but all flash i recognized him i made effort blush that strained every muscle me answered as sweetly winningly as ever i knew how been little slow but am just this minute closing on place where they keep it come help he softened said make it bottle champagne he was agreeable he said he had seen my name papers had put all his affairs aside turned out resolved find me or die make me answer that question satisfactorily or kill me though most his late asperity had been rather counterfeit than otherwise this meeting brought back me st louis riots about thirty years ago i spent week there at that time boarding house had this young fellow for neighbor across hall we saw some fightings killings by by we went one night armory where two hundred young men had met upon call be armed go forth against rioters under command military man we drilled till about ten o clock at night then news came that mob were great force lower end town were sweeping everything before them our column moved at once it was very hot night my musket was very heavy we marched marched nearer we approached seat war hotter i grew thirstier i got i was behind my friend so finally i asked him hold my musket while i dropped out got drink then i branched off went home i was not feeling any solicitude about him course because i knew he was so well armed now that he could take care himself without any trouble if i had had any doubts about that i would have borrowed another musket for him i left city pretty early next morning if this grizzled man had not happened encounter my name papers other day st louis felt moved seek me out i should have carried my grave heart torturing uncertainty as whether he ever got out riots all right or not i ought have inquired thirty years ago i know that i would have inquired if i had had muskets but circumstances he seemed better fixed conduct investigations than i was one monday near time our visit st louis globe democrat came out with couple pages sunday statistics whereby it appeared that 119 448 st louis people attended morning evening church services day before 23 102 children attended sunday school thus 142 550 persons out city s total 400 000 population respected day religious wise i found these statistics condensed form telegram associated press preserved them they made it apparent that st louis was higher state grace than she could have claimed be my time but now that i canvass figures narrowly i suspect that telegraph mutilated them it cannot be that there are more than 150 000 catholics town other 250 000 must be classified as protestants out these 250 000 according this questionable telegram only 26 362 attended church sunday school while out 150 000 catholics 116 188 went church sunday school chapter 52 burning brand all at once thought came into my mind i have not sought out mr brown upon that text i desire depart from direct line my subject make little excursion i wish reveal secret which i have carried with me nine years which has become burdensome upon certain occasion nine years ago i had said with strong feeling if ever i see st louis again i will seek out mr brown great grain merchant ask him privilege shaking him by hand occasion circumstances were as follows friend mine clergyman came one evening said i have most remarkable letter here which i want read you if i can do it without breaking down i must preface it with some explanations however letter is written by ex thief ex

his father was clergyman while lying jail his health began fail he was threatened with consumption this fact together with opportunity for reflection afforded by solitary confinement had its effect its natural effect he fell into serious thought his early training asserted itself with power wrought with strong influence upon his mind heart he put his old life behind him became earnest christian some ladies town heard this visited him by their encouraging words supported him his good resolutions strengthened him continue his new life trial ended his conviction sentence state prison for term nine years as i have before said prison he became acquainted with poor wretch referred beginning my talk jack hunt writer letter which i am going read you will see that acquaintanceship bore fruit for hunt when hunt s time was out he wandered st louis from that place he wrote his letter williams letter got no further than office prison warden course prisoners are not often allowed receive letters from outside prison authorities read this letter but did not destroy it they had not heart do it they read it several persons eventually it fell into hands those ladies whom i spoke while ago other day i came across old friend mine clergyman who had seen this letter was full it mere remembrance it so moved him that he could not talk it without his voice breaking he promised get copy it for me

result was not promising however he determined risk it did he got through tolerably well but his audience broke down early stayed that condition end fame letter spread through town brother minister came borrowed manuscript put it bodily into sermon preached sermon twelve hundred people on sunday morning letter drowned them their own tears then my friend put it into sermon went before his sunday morning congregation with it it scored another triumph house wept as one individual my friend went on summer vacation up into fishing regions our northern british neighbors carried this sermon with him since he might possibly chance need sermon he was asked preach one day little church was full among people present were late dr j g holland late mr seymour new york times mr page philanthropist temperance advocate i think senator frye maine marvelous letter did its wonted work all people were moved all people wept tears flowed steady stream down dr holland s cheeks nearly same can be said with regard all who were there mr page was so full enthusiasm over letter that he said he would not rest until he made pilgrimage that prison had speech with man who had been able inspire fellow unfortunate write so priceless tract ah that unlucky page another man if they had only been jericho that letter would have rung through world stirred all hearts all nations for thousand years come nobody might ever have found out that it was confoundedest brazenest ingeniousest piece fraud humbuggery that was ever concocted fool poor confiding mortals with letter was pure swindle that is truth take it by large it was without compeer among swindles it was perfect it was rounded symmetrical complete colossal reader learns it at this point but we didn t learn it till some miles weeks beyond this stage affair my friend came back from woods he other clergymen lay missionaries began once more inundate audiences with their tears tears said audiences i begged hard for permission print letter magazine tell watery story its triumphs numbers people got copies letter with permission circulate them writing but not print copies were sent sandwich islands other far regions charles dudley warner was at church one day when worn letter was read wept over at church door afterward he dropped peculiarly cold iceberg down clergyman s back with question do you know that letter be genuine it was first suspicion that had ever been voiced but it had that sickening effect which first uttered suspicions against one s idol always have some talk followed why what should make you suspect that it isn t genuine nothing that i know except that it is too neat compact fluent nicely put together for ignorant person unpractised hand i think it was done by educated man literary artist had detected literary machinery if you will look at letter now you will detect it yourself it is observable every line straightway clergyman went off with this seed suspicion sprouting him wrote minister residing that town where williams had been jailed converted asked for light also asked if person literary line meaning me might be allowed print letter tell its history he presently received this answer rev my dear friend regard that convict s letter there can be no doubt as its genuineness williams whom it was written lay our jail professed have been converted rev mr chaplain had great faith genuineness change as much as one can have any such case letter was sent one our ladies who is sunday school teacher sent either by williams himself or chaplain state s prison probably she has been greatly annoyed having so much publicity lest it might seem breach confidence or be injury williams regard its publication i can give no permission though if names places were omitted especially if sent out country i think you might take responsibility do it it is wonderful letter which no christian genius much less one unsanctified could ever have written as showing work grace human heart very degraded wicked one it proves its own origin reproves our weak faith its power cope with any form wickedness mr brown st louis some one said was hartford man do all whom you send from hartford serve their master as well p s williams is still state s prison serving out long sentence nine years i think he has been sick threatened with consumption but i have not inquired after him lately this lady that i speak corresponds with him i presume will be quite sure look after him this letter arrived few days after it was written up went mr williams s stock again mr warner s low down suspicion was laid cold cold grave where it apparently belonged it was suspicion based upon mere internal evidence anyway when you come internal evidence it s big field game that two can play at as witness this other internal evidence discovered by writer note above quoted that it is wonderful letter which no christian genius much less one unsanctified could ever have written i had permission now print provided i suppressed names places sent my narrative out country so i chose australian magazine for vehicle as being far enough out country set myself work on my article ministers set pumps going again with letter work handles but meantime brother page had been agitating he had not visited penitentiary but he had sent copy illustrious letter chaplain that institution accompanied it with apparently inquiries he got answer dated four days later than that other brother s reassuring epistle before my article was complete it wandered into my hands original is before me now i here append it it is pretty well loaded with internal evidence most solid description state s prison chaplain s office july 11 1873 dear bro page herewith please find letter kindly loaned me i am afraid its genuineness cannot be established it purports be addressed some prisoner here no such letter ever came prisoner here all letters received are carefully read by officers prison before they go into hands convicts any such letter could not be forgotten again charles williams is not christian man but dissolute cunning prodigal whose father is minister gospel his name is assumed one i am glad have made your acquaintance i am preparing lecture upon life seen through prison bars should like deliver same your vicinity so ended that little drama my poor article went into fire for whereas materials for it were now more abundant infinitely richer than they had previously been there were parties all around me who although longing for publication before were unit for suppression at this stage complexion game they said wait wound is too fresh yet all copies famous letter except mine disappeared suddenly from that time onward aforetime same old drought set churches as rule town was on spacious grin for while but there were places it where grin did not appear where it was dangerous refer ex convict s letter word explanation jack hunt professed writer letter was imaginary person burglar williams harvard graduate son minister wrote letter himself himself got it smuggled out prison got it conveyed persons who had supported encouraged him his conversion where he knew two things would happen genuineness letter would not be doubted or inquired into nub it would be noticed would have valuable effect effect indeed starting movement get mr williams pardoned out prison that nub is so ingeniously so casually flung immediately left there tail letter undwelt upon that indifferent reader would never suspect that it was heart core epistle if he even took note it at all this is nub i hope warm weather is doing your lungs good i was afraid when you was bleeding you would die give my respects etc that is all there is it simply touch go no dwelling upon it nevertheless it was intended for eye that would be swift see it it was meant move kind heart try effect liberation poor reformed purified fellow lying fell grip consumption when i for first time heard that letter read nine years ago i felt that it was most remarkable one i had ever encountered it so warmed me toward mr brown st louis that i said that if ever i visited that city again i would seek out that excellent man kiss hem his garment if it was new one well i visited st louis but i did not hunt for mr brown for alas investigations long ago had proved that benevolent brown like jack hunt was not real person but sheer invention that gifted rascal williams burglar harvard graduate son clergyman chapter 53 my boyhood s home we took passage one fast boats st louis st paul packet company started up river when i as boy first saw mouth missouri river it was twenty two or twenty three miles above st louis according estimate pilots wear tear banks have moved it down eight miles since then pilots say that within five years river will cut through move mouth down five miles more which will bring it within ten miles st louis about nightfall we passed large flourishing town alton illinois before daylight next morning town louisiana missouri sleepy village my day but brisk railway center now however all towns out there are railway centers now i could not clearly recognize place this seemed odd me for when i retired from rebel army 61 i retired upon louisiana good order at least good enough order for person who had not yet learned how retreat according rules war had trust native genius it seemed me that for first attempt at retreat it was not badly done i had done no advancing all that campaign that was at all equal it there was railway bridge across river here well sprinkled with glowing lights very beautiful sight it was at seven morning we reached hannibal missouri where my boyhood was spent i had had glimpse it fifteen years ago another glimpse six years earlier but both were so brief that they hardly counted only notion town that remained my mind was memory it as i had known it when i first quitted it twenty nine years ago that picture it was still as clear vivid me as photograph i stepped ashore with feeling one who returns out dead gone generation i had sort realizing sense what bastille prisoners must have felt when they used come out look upon paris after years captivity note how curiously familiar strange were mixed together before them i saw new houses saw them plainly enough but they did not affect older picture my mind for through their solid bricks mortar i saw vanished houses which had formerly stood there with perfect distinctness it was sunday morning everybody was abed yet so i passed through vacant streets still seeing town as it was not as it is recognizing metaphorically shaking hands with hundred familiar objects which no longer exist finally climbed holiday s hill get comprehensive view whole town lay spread out below me then i could mark fix every locality every detail naturally i was good deal moved i said many people i once knew this tranquil refuge my childhood are now heaven some i trust are other place things about me before me made me feel like boy again convinced me that i was boy again that i had simply been dreaming unusually long dream but my reflections spoiled all that for they forced me say i see fifty old houses down yonder into each which i could enter find either man or woman who was baby or unborn when i noticed those houses last or grandmother who was plump young bride at that time from this vantage ground extensive view up down river wide over wooded expanses illinois is very beautiful one most beautiful on mississippi i think which is hazardous remark make for eight hundred miles river between st louis st paul afford unbroken succession lovely pictures it may be that my affection for one question biases my judgment its favor i cannot say as that no matter it was satisfyingly beautiful me it had this advantage over all other friends whom i was about greet again it had suffered no change it was as young fresh comely gracious as ever it had been whereas faces others would be old scarred with campaigns life marked with their griefs defeats would give me no upliftings spirit old gentleman out on early morning walk came along we discussed weather then drifted into other matters i could not remember his face he said he had been living here twenty eight years so he had come after my time i had never seen him before i asked him various questions first about mate mine sunday school what became him he graduated with honor eastern college wandered off into world somewhere succeeded at nothing passed out knowledge memory years ago is supposed have gone dogs he was bright promised well when he was boy yes but thing that happened is what became it all i asked after another lad altogether brightest our village school when i was boy he too was graduated with honors from eastern college but life whipped him every battle straight along he died one territories years ago defeated man i asked after another bright boys he is success always has been always will be i think i inquired after young fellow who came town study for one professions when i was boy he went at something else before he got through went from medicine law or from law medicine then some other new thing went away for year came back with young wife fell drinking then gambling behind door finally took his wife two young children her father s went off mexico went from bad worse finally died there without cent buy shroud without friend attend funeral pity for he was best natured most cheery hopeful young fellow that ever was i named another boy oh he is all right lives here yet has wife children is prospering same verdict concerning other boys i named three school girls first two live here are married have children other is long ago dead never married i named with emotion one my early sweethearts she is all right been married three times buried two husbands divorced from third i hear she is getting ready marry old fellow out colorado somewhere she s got children scattered around here there most everywheres answer several other inquiries was brief simple killed war i named another boy well now his case is curious there wasn t human being this town but knew that that boy was perfect chucklehead perfect dummy just stupid ass as you may say everybody knew it everybody said it well if that very boy isn t first lawyer state missouri day i m democrat is that so it s actually so i m telling you truth how do you account for it account for it there ain t any accounting for it except that if you send damned fool st louis you don t tell them he s damned fool they ll never find it out there s one thing sure if i had damned fool i should know what do with him ship him st louis it s noblest market world for that kind property well when you come look at it all around chew at it think it over don t it just bang anything you ever heard well yes it does seem but don t you think maybe it was hannibal people who were mistaken about boy not st louis people oh nonsense people here have known him from very cradle they knew him hundred times better than st louis idiots could have known him no if you have got any damned fools that you want realize on take my advice send them st louis i mentioned great number people whom i had formerly known some were dead some were gone away some had prospered some had come naught but as regarded dozen or so lot answer was comforting prosperous live here yet town littered with their children i asked about miss died insane asylum three or four years ago never was out it from time she went was always suffering too never got shred her mind back if he spoke truth here was heavy tragedy indeed thirty six years madhouse that some young fools might have some fun i was small boy at time i saw those giddy young ladies come tiptoeing into room where miss sat reading at midnight by lamp girl at head file wore shroud doughface she crept behind victim touched her on shoulder she looked up screamed then fell into convulsions she did not recover from fright but went mad these days it seems incredible that people believed ghosts so short time ago but they did after asking after such other folk as i could call mind i finally inquired about myself oh he succeeded well enough another case damned fool if they d sent him st louis he d have succeeded sooner it was with much satisfaction that i recognized wisdom having told this candid gentleman beginning that my name was smith chapter 54 past present being left myself up there i went on picking out old houses distant town calling back their former inmates out moldy past among them i presently recognized house father lem hackett fictitious name it carried me back more than generation moment landed me midst time when happenings life were not natural logical results great general laws but special orders were freighted with very precise distinct purposes partly punitive intent partly admonitory usually local application when i was small boy lem hackett was drowned on sunday he fell out empty flat boat where he was playing being loaded with sin he went bottom like anvil he was only boy village who slept that night we others all lay awake repenting we had not needed information delivered from pulpit that evening that lem s was case special judgment we knew that already there was ferocious thunder storm that night it raged continuously until near dawn winds blew windows rattled rain swept along roof pelting sheets at briefest intervals inky blackness night vanished houses over way glared out white blinding for quivering instant then solid darkness shut down again splitting peal thunder followed which seemed rend everything neighborhood shreds splinters i sat up bed quaking shuddering waiting for destruction world expecting it me there was nothing strange or incongruous heaven s making such uproar about lem hackett apparently it was right proper thing do not doubt entered my mind that all angels were grouped together discussing this boy s case observing awful bombardment our beggarly little village with satisfaction approval there was one thing which disturbed me most serious way that was thought that this centering celestial interest on our village could not fail attract attention observers people among us who might otherwise have escaped notice for years i felt that i was not only one those people but very one most likely be discovered that discovery could have but one result i should be fire with lem before chill river had been fairly warmed out him i knew that this would be only just fair i was increasing chances against myself all time by feeling secret bitterness against lem for having attracted this fatal attention me but i could not help it this sinful thought persisted infesting my breast spite me every time lightning glared i caught my breath judged i was gone my terror misery i meanly began suggest other boys mention acts theirs which were wickeder than mine peculiarly needed punishment i tried pretend myself that i was simply doing this casual way without intent divert heavenly attention them for purpose getting rid it myself with deep sagacity i put these mentions into form sorrowing recollections left handed sham supplications that sins those boys might be allowed pass unnoticed possibly they may repent it is true that jim smith broke window lied about it but maybe he did not mean any harm although tom holmes says more bad words than any other boy village he probably intends repent though he has never said he would whilst it is fact that john jones did fish little on sunday once he didn t really catch anything but only just one small useless mud cat maybe that wouldn t have been so awful if he had thrown it back as he says he did but he didn t pity but they would repent these dreadful things maybe they will yet but while i was shamefully trying draw attention these poor chaps who were doubtless directing celestial attention me at same moment though i never once suspected that i had heedlessly left my candle burning it was not time neglect even trifling precautions there was no occasion add anything facilities for attracting notice me so i put light out it was long night me perhaps most distressful one i ever spent i endured agonies remorse for sins which i knew i had committed for others which i was not certain about yet was sure that they had been set down against me book by angel who was wiser than i did not trust such important matters memory it struck me by by that i had been making most foolish calamitous mistake one respect doubtless i had not only made my own destruction sure by directing attention those other boys but had already accomplished theirs doubtless lightning had stretched them all dead their beds by this time anguish fright which this thought gave me made my previous sufferings seem trifling by comparison things had become truly serious i resolved turn over new leaf instantly i also resolved connect myself with church next day if i survived see its sun appear i resolved cease from sin all its forms lead high blameless life for ever after i would be punctual at church sunday school visit sick carry baskets victuals poor simply fulfil regulation conditions although i knew we had none among us so poor but they would smash basket over my head for my pains i would instruct other boys right ways take resulting trouncings meekly i would subsist entirely on tracts i would invade rum shop warn drunkard finally if i escaped fate those who early become too good live i would go for missionary storm subsided toward daybreak i dozed gradually sleep with sense obligation lem hackett for going eternal suffering that abrupt way thus preventing far more dreadful disaster my own loss but when i rose refreshed by by found that those other boys were still alive i had dim sense that perhaps whole thing was false alarm that entire turmoil had been on lem s account nobody s else world looked so bright safe that there did not seem be any real occasion turn over new leaf i was little subdued during that day perhaps next after that my purpose reforming slowly dropped out my mind i had peaceful comfortable time again until next storm that storm came about three weeks later it was most unaccountable one me that i had ever experienced for on afternoon that day dutchy was drowned dutchy belonged our sunday school he was german lad who did not know enough come out rain but he was exasperatingly good had prodigious memory one sunday he made himself envy all youth talk all admiring village by reciting three thousand verses scripture without missing word then he went off very next day got drowned circumstances gave his death peculiar impressiveness we were all bathing muddy creek which had deep hole it this hole coopers had sunk pile green hickory hoop poles soak some twelve feet under water we were diving seeing who could stay under longest we managed remain down by holding on hoop poles dutchy made such poor success it that he was hailed with laughter derision every time his head appeared above water at last he seemed hurt with taunts begged us stand still on bank be fair with him give him honest count be friendly kind just this once not miscount for sake having fun laughing at him treacherous winks were exchanged all said all right dutchy go ahead we ll play fair dutchy plunged but boys instead beginning count followed lead one their number scampered range blackberry bushes close by hid behind it they imagined dutchy s humiliation when he should rise after superhuman effort find place silent vacant nobody there applaud they were so full laugh with idea that they were continually exploding into muffled cackles time swept on presently one who was peeping through briers said with surprise why he hasn t come up yet laughing stopped boys it s splendid dive said one never mind that said another joke on him is all better for it there was remark or two more then pause talking ceased all began peer through vines before long boys faces began look uneasy then anxious then terrified still there was no movement placid water hearts began beat fast faces turn pale we all glided out silently stood on bank our horrified eyes wandering back forth from each other s countenances water somebody must go down see yes that was plain but nobody wanted that grisly task draw straws so we did with hands which shook so that we hardly knew what we were about lot fell me i went down water was so muddy i could not see anything but i felt around among hoop poles presently grasped limp wrist which gave me no response if it had i should not have known it i let it go with such frightened suddenness boy had been caught among hoop poles entangled there helplessly i fled surface told awful news some us knew that if boy were dragged out at once he might possibly be resuscitated but we never thought that we did not think anything we did not know what do so we did nothing except that smaller lads cried piteously we all struggled frantically into our clothes putting on anybody s that came handy getting them wrong side out upside down as rule then we scurried away gave alarm but none us went back see end tragedy we had more important thing attend we all flew home lost not moment getting ready lead better life night presently closed down then came on that tremendous utterly unaccountable storm i was perfectly dazed i could not understand it it seemed me that there must be some mistake elements were turned loose they rattled banged blazed away most blind frantic manner all heart hope went out me dismal thought kept floating through my brain if boy who knows three thousand verses by heart is not satisfactory what chance is there for anybody else course i never questioned for moment that storm was on dutchy s account or that he or any other inconsequential animal was worthy such majestic demonstration from on high lesson it was only thing that troubled me for it convinced me that if dutchy with all his perfections was not delight it would be vain for me turn over new leaf for i must infallibly fall hopelessly short that boy no matter how hard i might try nevertheless i did turn it over highly educated fear compelled me do that but succeeding days cheerfulness sunshine came bothering around within month i had so drifted backward that again i was as lost comfortable as ever breakfast time approached while i mused these musings called these ancient happenings back mind so i got me back into present went down hill on my way through town hotel i saw house which was my home when i was boy at present rates people who now occupy it are no more value than i am but my time they would have been worth not less than five hundred dollars apiece they are colored folk after breakfast i went out alone again intending hunt up some sunday schools see how this generation pupils might compare with their progenitors who had sat with me those places had probably taken me as model though i do not remember as that now by public square there had been my day shabby little brick church called old ship zion which i had attended as sunday school scholar i found locality easily enough but not old church it was gone trig rather hilarious new edifice was its place pupils were better dressed better looking than were those my time consequently they did not resemble their ancestors consequently there was nothing familiar me their faces still i contemplated them with deep interest yearning wistfulness if i had been girl i would have cried for they were offspring represented occupied places boys girls some whom i had loved love some whom i had loved hate but all whom were dear me for one reason or other so many years gone by lord where be they now i was mightily stirred would have been grateful be allowed remain unmolested look my fill but bald summited superintendent who had been tow headed sunday school mate mine on that spot early ages recognized me i talked flutter wild nonsense those children hide thoughts which were me which could not have been spoken without betrayal feeling that would have been recognized as out character with me making speeches without preparation is no gift mine i was resolved shirk any new opportunity but next larger sunday school i found myself rear assemblage so i was very willing go on platform moment for sake getting good look at scholars on spur moment i could not recall any old idiotic talks which visitors used insult me with when i was pupil there i was sorry for this since it would have given me time excuse dawdle there take long satisfying look at what i feel at liberty say was array fresh young comeliness not matchable another sunday school same size as i talked merely get chance inspect as i strung out random rubbish solely prolong inspection i judged it but decent confess these low motives i did so if model boy was either these sunday schools i did not see him model boy my time we never had but one was perfect perfect manners perfect dress perfect conduct perfect filial piety perfect exterior godliness but at bottom he was prig as for contents his skull they could have changed place with contents pie nobody would have been worse off for it but pie this fellow s reproachlessness was standing reproach every lad village he was admiration all mothers detestation all their sons i was told what became him but as it was disappointment me i will not enter into details he succeeded life chapter 55 vendetta other things during my three days stay town i woke up every morning with impression that i was boy for my dreams faces were all young again looked as they had looked old times but i went bed hundred years old every night for meantime i had been seeing those faces as they are now course i suffered some surprises along at first before i had become adjusted changed state things i met young ladies who did not seem have changed at all but they turned out be daughters young ladies i had mind sometimes their grand daughters when you are told that stranger fifty is grandmother there is nothing surprising about it but if on contrary she is person whom you knew as little girl it seems impossible you say yourself how can little girl be grandmother it takes some little time accept realize fact that while you have been growing old your friends have not been standing still that matter i noticed that greatest changes observable were with women not men i saw men whom thirty years had changed but slightly but their wives had grown old these were good women it is very wearing be good there was saddler whom i wished see but he was gone dead these many years they said once or twice day saddler used go tearing down street putting on his coat as he went then everybody knew steamboat was coming everybody knew also that john stavely was not expecting anybody by boat or any freight either stavely must have known that everybody knew this still it made no difference him he liked seem himself be expecting hundred thousand tons saddles by this boat so he went on all his life enjoying being faithfully on hand receive receipt for those saddles case by any miracle they should come malicious quincy paper used always refer this town derision as stavely s landing stavely was one my earliest admirations i envied him his rush imaginary business display he was able make it before strangers as he went flying down street struggling with his fluttering coat but there was carpenter who was my chiefest hero he was mighty liar but i did not know that i believed everything he said he was romantic sentimental melodramatic fraud his bearing impressed me with awe i vividly remember first time he took me into his confidence he was planing board every now then he would pause heave deep sigh occasionally mutter broken sentences confused not intelligible but out their midst ejaculation sometimes escaped which made me shiver did me good one was o god it is his blood i sat on tool chest humbly shudderingly admired him for i judged he was full crime at last he said low voice my little friend can you keep secret i eagerly said i could dark dreadful one i satisfied him on that point then i will tell you some passages my history for oh i must relieve my burdened soul or i shall die he cautioned me once more be as silent as grave then he told me he was red handed murderer he put down his plane held his hands out before him contemplated them sadly said look with these hands i have taken lives thirty human beings effect which this had upon me was inspiration him he turned himself loose upon his subject with interest energy he left generalizing went into details began with his first murder described it told what measures he had taken avert suspicion then passed his second homicide his third his fourth so on he had always done his murders with bowie knife he made all my hairs rise by suddenly snatching it out showing it me at end this first seance i went home with six his fearful secrets among my freightage found them great help my dreams which had been sluggish for while back i sought him again again on my saturday holidays fact i spent summer with him all it which was valuable me his fascinations never diminished for he threw something fresh stirring way horror into each successive murder he always gave names dates places everything this by by enabled me note two things that he had killed his victims every quarter globe that these victims were always named lynch destruction lynches went serenely on saturday after saturday until original thirty had multiplied sixty more be heard from yet then my curiosity got better my timidity i asked how it happened that these justly punished persons all bore same name my hero said he had never divulged that dark secret any living being but felt that he could trust me therefore he would lay bare before me story his sad blighted life he had loved one too fair for earth she had reciprocated with all sweet affection her pure noble nature but he had rival base hireling named archibald lynch who said girl should be his or he would dye his hands her heart s best blood carpenter innocent happy love s young dream gave no weight threat but led his golden haired darling altar there two were made one there also just as minister s hands were stretched blessing over their heads fell deed was done with knife bride fell corpse at her husband s feet what did husband do he plucked forth that knife kneeling by body his lost one swore consecrate his life extermination all human scum that bear hated name lynch that was it he had been hunting down lynches slaughtering them from that day this twenty years he had always used that same consecrated knife with it he had murdered his long array lynches with it he had left upon forehead each victim peculiar mark cross deeply incised said he cross mysterious avenger is known europe america china siam tropics polar seas deserts asia all earth wherever uttermost parts globe lynch has penetrated there has mysterious cross been seen those who have seen it have shuddered said it is his mark he has been here you have heard mysterious avenger look upon him for before you stands no less person but beware breathe not word any soul be silent wait some morning this town will flock aghast view gory corpse on its brow will be seen awful sign men will tremble whisper he has been here it is mysterious avenger s mark you will come here but i shall have vanished you will see me no more this ass had been reading jibbenainosay no doubt had had his poor romantic head turned by it but as i had not yet seen book then i took his inventions for truth did not suspect that he was plagiarist however we had lynch living town more i reflected upon his impending doom more i could not sleep it seemed my plain duty save him still plainer more important duty get some sleep for myself so at last i ventured go mr lynch tell him what was about happen him under strict secrecy i advised him fly certainly expected him do it but he laughed at me he did not stop there he led me down carpenter s shop gave carpenter jeering scornful lecture upon his silly pretensions slapped his face made him get down on his knees beg then went off left me contemplate cheap pitiful ruin what my eyes had so lately been majestic incomparable hero carpenter blustered flourished his knife doomed this lynch his usual volcanic style size his fateful words undiminished but it was all wasted upon me he was hero me no longer but only poor foolish exposed humbug i was ashamed him ashamed myself i took no further interest him never went his shop any more he was heavy loss me for he was greatest hero i had ever known fellow must have had some talent for some his imaginary murders were so vividly dramatically described that i remember all their details yet people hannibal are not more changed than is town it is no longer village it is city with mayor council water works probably debt it has fifteen thousand people is thriving energetic place is paved like rest west south where well paved street good sidewalk are things so seldom seen that one doubts them when he does see them customary half dozen railways center hannibal now there is new depot which cost hundred thousand dollars my time town had no specialty no commercial grandeur daily packet usually landed passenger bought catfish took away another passenger hatful freight but now huge commerce lumber has grown up large miscellaneous commerce is one results deal money changes

that tramp was wandering about streets one chilly evening with pipe his mouth begging for match he got neither matches nor courtesy on contrary troop bad little boys followed him around amused themselves with nagging annoying him i assisted but at last some appeal which wayfarer made for forbearance accompanying it with pathetic reference his forlorn friendless condition touched such sense shame remnant right feeling as were left me i went away got him some matches then hied me home bed heavily weighted as conscience unbuoyant spirit hour or two afterward man was arrested locked up calaboose by marshal large name for constable but that was his title at two morning church bells rang for fire everybody turned out course i with rest tramp had used his matches disastrously he had set his straw bed on fire oaken sheathing room had caught when i reached ground two hundred men women children stood massed together transfixed with horror staring at grated windows jail behind iron bars tugging frantically at them screaming for help stood tramp he seemed like black object set against sun so white intense was light at his back that marshal could not be found he had only key battering ram was quickly improvised thunder its blows upon door had so encouraging sound that spectators broke into wild cheering believed merciful battle won but it was not so timbers were too strong they did not yield it was said that man s death grip still held fast bars after he was dead that this position fires wrapped him about consumed him as this i do not know what was seen after i recognized face that was pleading through bars was seen by others not by me i saw that face so situated every night for long time afterward i believed myself as guilty man s death as if i had given him matches purposely that he might burn himself up with them i had not doubt that i should be hanged if my connection with this tragedy were found out happenings impressions that time are burnt into my memory study them entertains me as much now as they themselves distressed me then if anybody spoke that grisly matter i was all ears moment alert hear what might be said for i was always dreading expecting find out that i was suspected so fine so delicate was perception my guilty conscience that it often detected suspicion most purposeless remarks looks gestures glances eye which had no significance but which sent me shivering away panic fright just same how sick it made me when somebody dropped howsoever carelessly barren intent remark that murder will out for boy ten years i was carrying pretty weighty cargo all this time i was blessedly forgetting one thing fact that i was inveterate talker my sleep but one night i awoke found my bed mate my younger brother sitting up bed contemplating me by light moon i said what is matter you talk so much i can t sleep i came sitting posture instant with my kidneys my throat my hair on end what did i say quick out with it what did i say nothing much it s lie you know everything everything about what you know well enough about that about what i don t know what you are talking about i think you are sick or crazy or something but anyway you re awake i ll get sleep while i ve got chance he fell asleep i lay there cold sweat turning this new terror over whirling chaos which did duty as my mind burden my thought was how much did i divulge how much does he know what distress is this uncertainty but by by i evolved idea i would wake my brother probe him with supposititious case i shook him up said suppose man should come you drunk this is foolish i never get drunk i don t mean you idiot i mean man suppose man should come you drunk borrow knife or tomahawk or pistol you forgot tell him it was loaded how could you load tomahawk i don t mean tomahawk i didn t say tomahawk i said pistol now don t you keep breaking that way because this is serious there s been man killed what this town yes this town well go on i won t say single word well then suppose you forgot tell him be careful with it because it was loaded he went off shot himself with that pistol fooling with it you know probably doing it by accident being drunk well would it be murder no suicide no no i don t mean his act i mean yours would you be murderer for letting him have that pistol after deep thought came this answer well i should think i was guilty something maybe murder yes probably murder but i don t quite know this made me very uncomfortable however it was not decisive verdict i should have set out real case there seemed be no other way but i would do it cautiously keep watch out for suspicious effects i said i was supposing case but i am coming real one now do you know how man came be burned up calaboose no haven t you least idea not least wish you may die your tracks if you have yes wish i may die my tracks well way it was this man wanted some matches light his pipe boy got him some man set fire calaboose with those very matches burnt himself up is that so yes it is now is that boy murderer do you think let me see man was drunk yes he was drunk very drunk yes boy knew it yes he knew it there was long pause then came this heavy verdict if man was drunk boy knew it boy murdered that man this is certain faint sickening sensations crept along all fibers my body i seemed know how person feels who hears his death sentence pronounced from bench i waited hear what my brother would say next i believed i knew what it would be i was right he said i know boy i had nothing say so i said nothing i simply shuddered then he added yes before you got half through telling about thing i knew perfectly well who boy was it was ben coontz i came out my collapse as one who rises from dead i said with admiration why how world did you ever guess it you told it your sleep i said myself how splendid that is this is habit which must be cultivated my brother rattled innocently on when you were talking your sleep you kept mumbling something about matches which i couldn t make anything out but just now when you began tell me about man calaboose matches i remembered that your sleep you mentioned ben coontz two or three times so i put this that together you see right away i knew it was ben that burnt that man up i praised his sagacity effusively presently he asked are you going give him up law no i said i believe that this will be lesson him i shall keep eye on him course for that is but right but if he stops where he is reforms it shall never be said that i betrayed him how good you are well i try be it is all person can do world like this now my burden being shifted other shoulders my terrors soon faded away day before we left hannibal curious thing fell under my notice surprising spread which longitudinal time undergoes there i learned it from one most unostentatious men colored coachman friend mine who lives three miles from town he was call for me at park hotel at 7 30 p m drive me out

chapter 57 archangel from st louis northward there are all enlivening signs presence active energetic intelligent prosperous practical nineteenth century populations people don t dream they work happy result is manifest all around substantial outside aspect things suggestions wholesome life comfort that everywhere appear quincy is notable example brisk handsome well ordered city now as formerly interested art letters other high things but marion city is exception marion city has gone backwards most unaccountable way this metropolis promised so well that projectors tacked city its name very beginning with full confidence but it was bad prophecy when i first saw marion city thirty five years ago it contained one street nearly or quite six houses it contains but one house now this one state ruin is getting ready follow former five into river doubtless marion city was too near quincy it had another disadvantage it was situated flat mud bottom below high water mark whereas quincy stands high up on slope hill beginning quincy had aspect ways model new england town these she has yet broad clean streets trim neat dwellings lawns fine mansions stately blocks commercial buildings there are ample fair grounds well kept park many attractive drives library reading rooms couple colleges some handsome costly churches grand court house with grounds which occupy square population city is thirty thousand there are some large factories here manufacturing many sorts is done on great scale la grange canton are growing towns but i missed alexandria was told it was under water but would come up blow summer keokuk was easily recognizable i lived there 1857 extraordinary year there real estate matters boom was something wonderful everybody bought everybody sold except widows preachers they always hold on when tide ebbs they get left anything semblance town lot no matter how situated was salable at figure which would still have been high if ground had been sodded with greenbacks town has population fifteen thousand now is progressing with healthy growth it was night we could not see details for which we were sorry for keokuk has reputation being beautiful city it was pleasant one live long ago doubtless has advanced not retrograded that respect mighty work which was progress there my day is finished now this is canal over rapids it is eight miles long three hundred feet wide is no place less than six feet deep its masonry is majestic kind which war department usually deals will endure like roman aqueduct work cost four or five millions after hour or two spent with former friends we started up river again keokuk long time ago was occasional loafing place that erratic genius henry clay dean i believe i never saw him but once but he was much talked when i lived there this is what was said him he began life poor without education but he educated himself on curbstones keokuk he would sit down on curbstone with his book careless or unconscious clatter commerce tramp passing crowds bury himself his studies by hour never changing his position except draw his knees now then let dray pass unobstructed when his book was finished its contents however abstruse had been burnt into his memory were his permanent possession this way he acquired vast hoard all sorts learning had it pigeon holed his head where he could put his intellectual hand on it whenever it was wanted his clothes differed no respect from wharf rat s except that they were raggeder more ill assorted inharmonious therefore more extravagantly picturesque several layers dirtier nobody could infer master mind top that edifice from edifice itself he was orator by nature first place later by training experience practice when he was out on canvass his name was lodestone which drew farmers his stump from fifty miles around his theme was always politics he used no notes for volcano does not need notes 1862 son keokuk s late distinguished citizen mr claggett gave me this incident concerning dean war feeling was running high keokuk 61 great mass meeting was be held on certain day new athenaeum distinguished stranger was address house after building had been packed its utmost capacity with sweltering folk both sexes stage still remained vacant distinguished stranger had failed connect crowd grew impatient by by indignant rebellious about this time distressed manager discovered dean on curb stone explained dilemma him took his book away from him rushed him into building back way told him make for stage save his country presently sudden silence fell upon grumbling audience everybody s eyes sought single point wide empty carpetless stage figure appeared there whose aspect was familiar hardly dozen persons present it was scarecrow dean foxy shoes down at heels socks odd colors also down damaged trousers relics antiquity world too short exposing some inches naked ankle unbuttoned vest also too short exposing zone soiled wrinkled linen between it waistband shirt bosom open long black handkerchief wound round round neck like bandage bob tailed blue coat reaching down small back with sleeves which left four inches forearm unprotected small stiff brimmed soldier cap hung on corner bump whichever bump it was this figure moved gravely out upon stage with sedate measured step down front where it paused dreamily inspected house saying no word silence surprise held its own for moment then was broken by just audible ripple merriment which swept sea faces like wash wave figure remained as before thoughtfully inspecting another wave started laughter this time it was followed by another then third this last one boisterous now stranger stepped back one pace took off his soldier cap tossed it into wing began speak with deliberation nobody listening everybody laughing whispering speaker talked on unembarrassed presently delivered shot which went home silence attention resulted he followed it quick fast with other telling things warmed his work began pour his words out instead dripping them grew hotter hotter fell discharging lightnings thunder now house began break into applause which speaker gave no heed but went hammering straight on unwound his black bandage cast it away still thundering presently discarded bob tailed coat flung it aside firing up higher higher all time finally flung vest after coat then for untimed period stood there like another vesuvius spouting smoke flame lava ashes raining pumice stone cinders shaking moral earth with intellectual crash upon crash explosion upon explosion while mad multitude stood upon their feet solid body answering back with ceaseless hurricane cheers through thrashing snowstorm waving handkerchiefs when dean came said claggett people thought he was escaped lunatic but when he went they thought he was escaped archangel burlington home sparkling burdette is another hill city also beautiful one unquestionably so fine flourishing city with population twenty five thousand belted with busy factories nearly every imaginable description it was very sober city too for moment for most sobering bill was pending bill forbid manufacture exportation importation purchase sale borrowing lending stealing drinking smelling or possession by conquest inheritance intent accident or otherwise state iowa each every deleterious beverage known human race except water this measure was approved by all rational people state but not by bench judges burlington has progressive modern city s full equipment devices for right intelligent government including paid fire department thing which great city new orleans is without but still employs that relic antiquity independent system burlington as all these upper river towns one breathes go ahead atmosphere which tastes good nostrils opera house has lately been built there which is strong contrast with shabby dens which usually do duty as theaters cities burlington s size we had not time go ashore muscatine but had daylight view it from boat i lived there awhile many years ago but place now had rather unfamiliar look so i suppose it has clear outgrown town which i used know fact i know it has for i remember it as small place which it isn t now but i remember it best for lunatic who caught me out fields one sunday extracted butcher knife from his boot proposed carve me up with it unless i acknowledged him be only son devil i tried compromise on acknowledgment that he was only member family i had met but that did not satisfy him he wouldn t have any half measures i must say he was sole only son devil he whetted his knife on his boot it did not seem worth while make trouble about little thing like that so i swung round his view matter saved my skin whole shortly afterward he went visit his father as he has not turned up since i trust he is there yet i remember muscatine still more pleasantly for its summer sunsets i have never seen any on either side ocean that equaled them they used broad smooth river as canvas painted on it every imaginable dream color from mottled daintinesses delicacies opal all way up through cumulative intensities blinding purple crimson conflagrations which were enchanting eye but sharply tried it at same time all upper mississippi region has these extraordinary sunsets as familiar spectacle it is true sunset land i am sure no other country can show so good right name sunrises are also said be exceedingly fine i do not know chapter 58 on upper river big towns drop thick fast now between stretch processions thrifty farms not desolate solitude hour by hour boat plows deeper deeper into great populous north west with each successive section it which is revealed one s surprise respect gather emphasis increase such people such achievements as theirs compel homage this is independent race who think for themselves who are competent do it because they are educated enlightened they read they keep abreast best newest thought they fortify every weak place their land with school college library newspaper they live under law solicitude for future race like this is not order this region is new so new that it may be said be still its babyhood by what it has accomplished while still teething one may forecast what marvels it will do strength its maturity it is so new that foreign tourist has not heard it yet has not visited it for sixty years foreign tourist has steamed up down river between st louis new orleans then gone home written his book believing he had seen all river that was worth seeing or that had anything see not six all these books is there mention these upper river towns for reason that five or six tourists who penetrated this region did it before these towns were projected latest tourist them all 1878 made same old regulation trip he had not heard that there was anything north st louis yet there was there was this amazing region bristling with great towns projected day before yesterday so speak built next morning score them number from fifteen hundred five thousand people then we have muscatine ten thousand winona ten thousand moline ten thousand rock island twelve thousand la crosse twelve thousand burlington twenty five thousand dubuque twenty five thousand davenport thirty thousand st paul fifty eight thousand minneapolis sixty thousand upward foreign tourist has never heard these there is no note them his books they have sprung up night while he slept so new is this region that i who am comparatively young am yet older than it is when i was born st paul had population three persons minneapolis had just third as many then population minneapolis died two years ago when he died he had seen himself undergo increase forty years fifty nine thousand nine hundred ninety nine persons he had frog s fertility i must explain that figures set down above as population st paul minneapolis are several months old these towns are far larger now fact i have just seen newspaper estimate which gives former seventy one thousand latter seventy eight thousand this book will not reach public for six or seven months yet none figures will be worth much then we had glimpse davenport which is another beautiful city crowning hill phrase which applies all these towns for they are all comely all well built clean orderly pleasant eye cheering spirit they are all situated upon hills therefore we will give that phrase rest indians have tradition that marquette joliet camped where davenport now stands 1673 next white man who camped there did it about hundred seventy years later 1834 davenport has gathered its thirty thousand people within past thirty years she sends more children her schools now than her whole population numbered twenty three years ago she has usual upper river quota factories newspapers institutions learning she has telephones local telegraphs electric alarm admirable paid fire department consisting six hook ladder companies four steam fire engines thirty churches davenport is official residence two bishops episcopal catholic opposite davenport is flourishing town rock island which lies at foot upper rapids great railroad bridge connects two towns one thirteen which fret mississippi pilots between st louis st paul charming island rock island three miles long half mile wide belongs united states government has turned it into wonderful park enhancing its natural attractions by art threading its fine forests with many miles drives near center island one catches glimpses through trees ten vast stone four story buildings each which covers acre ground these are government workshops for rock island establishment is national armory arsenal we move up river always through enchanting scenery there being no other kind on upper mississippi pass moline center vast manufacturing industries clinton lyons great lumber centers presently reach dubuque which is situated rich mineral region lead mines are very productive wide extent dubuque has great number manufacturing establishments among them plow factory which has for customers all christendom general at least so i was told by agent concern who was on boat he said you show me any country under sun where they really know how plow if i don t show you our mark on plow they use i ll eat that plow i won t ask for any woostershyre sauce flavor it up with either all this part river is rich indian history traditions black hawk s was once puissant name hereabouts as was keokuk s further down few miles below dubuque is tete de mort death s head rock or bluff top which french drove band indians early times cooped them up there with death for certainty only manner it matter choice starve or jump off kill themselves black hawk adopted ways white people toward end his life when he died he was buried near des moines christian fashion modified by indian custom that is say clothed christian military uniform with christian cane his hand but deposited grave sitting posture formerly horse had always been buried with chief substitution cane shows that black hawk s haughty nature was really humbled he expected walk when he got over we noticed that above dubuque water mississippi was olive green rich beautiful semi transparent with sun on it course water was nowhere as clear or as fine complexion as it is some other seasons year for now it was at flood stage therefore dimmed blurred by mud manufactured from caving banks majestic bluffs that overlook river along through this region charm one with grace variety their forms soft beauty their adornment steep verdant slope whose base is at water s edge is topped by lofty rampart broken turreted rocks which are exquisitely rich mellow color mainly dark browns dull greens but splashed with other tints then you have shining river winding here there yonder its sweep interrupted at intervals by clusters wooded islands threaded by silver channels you have glimpses distant villages asleep upon capes stealthy rafts slipping along shade forest walls white steamers vanishing around remote points it is all as tranquil reposeful as dreamland has nothing this worldly about it nothing hang fret or worry upon until unholy train comes tearing along which it presently does ripping sacred solitude rags tatters with its devil s warwhoop roar thunder its rushing wheels straightway you are back this world with one its frets ready hand for your entertainment for you remember that this is very road whose stock always goes down after you buy it always goes up again as soon as you sell it it makes me shudder this day remember that i once came near not getting rid my stock at all it must be awful thing have railroad left on your hands locomotive is sight from deck steamboat almost whole way from st louis st paul eight hundred miles these railroads have made havoc with steamboat commerce clerk our boat was steamboat clerk before these roads were built that day influx population was so great freight business so heavy that boats were not able keep up with demands made upon their carrying capacity consequently captains were very independent airy pretty biggity as uncle remus would say clerk nut shelled contrast between former time present thus boat used land captain on hurricane roof mighty stiff straight iron ramrod for spine kid gloves plug tile hair parted behind man on shore takes off hat says got twenty eight tons wheat cap n be great favor if you can take them captain says ll take two them don t even condescend look at him but nowadays captain takes off his old slouch smiles all way around back his ears gets off bow which he hasn t got any ramrod interfere with says glad see you smith glad see you you re looking well haven t seen you looking so well for years what you got for us nuth n says smith keeps his hat on just turns his back goes talking with somebody else oh yes eight years ago captain was on top but it s smith s turn now eight years ago boat used go up river with every stateroom full people piled five six deep on cabin floor solid deck load immigrants harvesters down below into bargain get first class stateroom you d got prove sixteen quarterings nobility four hundred years descent or be personally acquainted with nigger that blacked captain s boots but it s all changed now plenty staterooms above no harvesters below there s patent self binder now they don t have harvesters any more they ve gone where woodbine twineth they didn t go by steamboat either went by train up this region we met massed acres lumber rafts coming down but not floating leisurely along old fashioned way manned with joyous reckless crews fiddling song singing whiskey drinking breakdown dancing rapscallions no whole thing was shoved swiftly along by powerful stern wheeler modern fashion small crews were quiet orderly men sedate business aspect with not suggestion romance about them anywhere along here somewhere on black night we ran some exceedingly narrow intricate island chutes by aid electric light behind was solid blackness crackless bank it ahead narrow elbow water curving between dense walls foliage that almost touched our bows on both sides here every individual leaf every individual ripple stood out its natural color flooded with glare as noonday intensified effect was strange fine very striking we passed prairie du chien another father marquette s camping places after some hours progress through varied beautiful scenery reached la crosse here is town twelve or thirteen thousand population with electric lighted streets with blocks buildings which are stately enough also architecturally fine enough command respect any city it is choice town we made satisfactory use hour allowed us roaming it over though weather was rainier than necessary chapter 59 legends scenery we added several passengers our list at la crosse among others old gentleman who had come this north western region with early settlers was familiar with every part it pardonably proud it too he said you ll find scenery between here st paul that can give hudson points you ll have queen s bluff seven hundred feet high just as imposing spectacle as you can find anywheres trempeleau island which isn t like any other island america i believe for it is gigantic mountain with precipitous sides is full indian traditions used be full rattlesnakes if you catch sun just right there you will have picture that will stay with you above winona you ll have lovely prairies then come thousand islands too beautiful for anything green why you never saw foliage so green nor packed so thick it s like thousand plush cushions afloat on looking glass when water s still then monstrous bluffs on both sides river ragged rugged dark complected just frame that s wanted you always want strong frame you know throw up nice points delicate picture make them stand out old gentleman also told us touching indian legend or two but not very powerful ones after this excursion into history he came back scenery described it detail by detail from thousand islands st paul naming its names with such facility tripping along his theme with such nimble confident ease slamming three ton word here there with such complacent air t isn t anything i can do it any time i want letting off fine surprises lurid eloquence at such judicious intervals that i presently began suspect but no matter what i began suspect hear him ten miles above winona we come fountain city nestling sweetly at feet cliffs that lift their awful fronts jovelike toward blue depths heaven bathing them virgin atmospheres that have known no other contact save that angels wings next we glide through silver waters amid lovely stupendous aspects nature that attune our hearts adoring admiration about twelve miles strike mount vernon six hundred feet high with romantic ruins once first class hotel perched far among cloud shadows that mottle its dizzy heights sole remnant once flourishing mount vernon town early days now desolate utterly deserted so we move on past chimney rock we fly noble shaft six hundred feet then just before landing at minnieska our attention is attracted by most striking promontory rising over five hundred feet ideal mountain pyramid its conic shape thickly wooded surface girding its sides its apex like that cone cause spectator wonder at nature s workings from its dizzy heights superb views forests streams bluffs hills dales below beyond for miles are brought within its focus what grander river scenery can be conceived as we gaze upon this enchanting landscape from uppermost point these bluffs upon valleys below primeval wildness awful loneliness these sublime creations nature nature s god excite feelings unbounded admiration recollection which can never be effaced from memory as we view them any direction next we have lion s head lioness s head carved by nature s hand adorn dominate beauteous stream then anon river widens most charming magnificent view valley before us suddenly bursts upon our vision rugged hills clad with verdant forests from summit base level prairie lands holding their lap beautiful wabasha city healing waters puissant foe bright s disease that grandest conception nature s works incomparable lake pepin these constitute picture whereon tourist s eye may gaze uncounted hours with rapture unappeased unappeasable so we glide along due time encountering those majestic domes mighty sugar loaf sublime maiden s rock which latter romantic superstition has invested with voice oft times as birch canoe glides near at twilight dusky paddler fancies he hears soft sweet music long departed winona darling indian song story then frontenac looms upon our vision delightful resort jaded summer tourists then progressive red wing diamond bluff impressive preponderous its lone sublimity then prescott st croix anon we see bursting upon us domes steeples st paul giant young chief north marching with seven league stride van progress banner bearer highest newest civilization carving his beneficent way with tomahawk commercial enterprise sounding warwhoop christian culture tearing off reeking scalp sloth superstition plant there steam plow school house ever his front stretch arid lawlessness ignorance crime despair ever his wake bloom jail gallows pulpit ever have you ever traveled with panorama i have formerly served that capacity my suspicion was confirmed do you still travel with it no she is laid up till fall season opens i am helping now work up materials for tourist s guide which st louis st paul packet company are going issue this summer for benefit travelers who go by that line when you were talking maiden s rock you spoke long departed winona darling indian song story is she maiden rock are two connected by legend yes very tragic painful one perhaps most celebrated as well as most pathetic all legends mississippi we asked him tell it he dropped out his conversational vein back into his lecture gait without effort rolled on as follows little distance above lake city is famous point known as maiden s rock which is not only picturesque spot but is full romantic interest from event which gave it its name not many years ago this locality was favorite resort for sioux indians on account fine fishing hunting be had there large numbers them were always be found this locality among families which used resort here was one belonging tribe wabasha we no na first born was name maiden who had plighted her troth lover belonging same band but her stern parents had promised her hand another famous warrior insisted on her wedding him day was fixed by her parents her great grief she appeared accede proposal accompany them rock for purpose gathering flowers for feast on reaching rock we no na ran its summit standing on its edge upbraided her parents who were below for their cruelty then singing death dirge threw herself from precipice dashed them pieces on rock below dashed who pieces her parents yes well it certainly was tragic business as you say moreover there is startling kind dramatic surprise about it which i was not looking for it is distinct improvement upon threadbare form indian legend there are fifty lover s leaps along mississippi from whose summit disappointed indian girls have jumped but this is only jump lot hat turned out right satisfactory way what became winona she was good deal jarred up jolted but she got herself together disappeared before coroner reached fatal spot tis said she sought married her true love wandered with him some distant clime where she lived happy ever after her gentle spirit mellowed chastened by romantic incident which had so early deprived her sweet guidance mother s love father s protecting arm thrown her all unfriended upon cold charity censorious world i was glad hear lecturer s description scenery for it assisted my appreciation what i saw it enabled me imagine such it as we lost by intrusion night as lecturer remarked this whole region is blanketed with indian tales traditions but i reminded him that people usually merely mention this fact doing it way make body s mouth water judiciously stopped there why because impression left was that these tales were full incident imagination pleasant impression which would be promptly dissipated if tales were told i showed him lot this sort literature which i had been collecting he confessed that it was poor stuff exceedingly sorry rubbish i ventured add that legends which he had himself told us were this character with single exception admirable story winona he granted these facts but said that if i would hunt up mr schoolcraft s book published near fifty years ago now doubtless out print i would find some indian inventions it that were very far from being barren incident imagination that tales hiawatha were this sort they came from schoolcraft s book that there were others same book which mr longfellow could have turned into verse with good effect for instance there was legend undying head he could not tell it for many details had grown dim his memory but he would recommend me find it enlarge my respect for indian imagination he said that this tale most others book were current among indians along this part mississippi when he first came here that contributors schoolcraft s book had got them directly from indian lips had written them down with strict exactness without embellishments their own i have found book lecturer was right there are several legends it which confirm what he said i will offer two them undying head peboan seegwun allegory seasons latter is used hiawatha but it is worth reading original form if only that one may see how effective genuine poem can be without helps graces poetic measure rhythm peboan seegwun old man was sitting alone his lodge by side frozen stream it was close winter his fire was almost out he appeared very old very desolate his locks were white with age he trembled every joint day after day passed solitude he heard nothing but sound tempest sweeping before it new fallen snow one day as his fire was just dying handsome young man approached entered his dwelling his cheeks were red with blood

ceremony was concluded they began speak i blow my breath said old man stream stands still water becomes stiff hard as clear stone i breathe said young man flowers spring up over plain i shake my locks

trailing arbutus small white flower with pink border which is one earliest species northern plants undying head is rather long tale but it makes up weird conceits fairy tale prodigies variety incident energy movement for what it lacks brevity footnote see appendix d chapter 60 speculations conclusions we reached st paul at head navigation mississippi there our voyage two thousand miles from new orleans ended it is about ten day trip by steamer it can probably be done quicker by rail i judge so because i know that one may go by rail from st louis hannibal distance at least hundred twenty miles seven hours this is better than walking unless one is hurry season being far advanced when we were new orleans roses magnolia blossoms were falling but here st paul it was snow new orleans we had caught occasional withering breath from over crater apparently here st paul we caught frequent benumbing one from over glacier apparently but i wander from my theme st paul is wonderful town it is put together solid blocks honest brick stone has air intending stay its post office was established thirty six years ago by by when postmaster received letter he carried it washington horseback inquire what was be done with it such is legend two frame houses were built that year several persons were added population recent number leading st paul paper pioneer press gives some statistics which furnish vivid contrast that old state things wit population autumn present year 1882 71 000 number letters handled first half year 1 209 387 number houses built during three quarters year 989 their cost 3 186 000 increase letters over corresponding six months last year was fifty per cent last year new buildings added city cost above 4 500 000 st paul s strength lies her commerce i mean his commerce he is manufacturing city course all cities that region are but he is peculiarly strong matter commerce last year his jobbing trade amounted upwards 52 000 000 he has custom house is building costly capitol replace one recently burned for he is capital state he has churches without end not cheap poor kind but kind that rich protestant puts up kind that poor irish hired girl delights erect what passion for building majestic churches irish hired girl has it is fine thing for our architecture but too often we enjoy her stately fanes without giving her grateful thought fact instead reflecting that every brick every stone this beautiful edifice represents ache or pain handful sweat hours heavy fatigue contributed by back forehead bones poverty it is our habit forget these things entirely merely glorify mighty temple itself without vouchsafing one praiseful thought its humble builder whose rich heart withered purse it symbolizes this is land libraries schools st paul has three public libraries they contain aggregate some forty thousand books he has one hundred sixteen school houses pays out more than seventy thousand dollars year teachers salaries there is unusually fine railway station so large is it fact that it seemed somewhat overdone matter size at first but at end few months it was perceived that mistake was distinctly other way error is be corrected town stands on high ground it is about seven hundred feet above sea level it is so high that wide view river lowland is offered from its streets it is very wonderful town indeed is not finished yet all streets are obstructed with building material this is being compacted into houses as fast as possible make room for more for other people are anxious build as soon as they can get use streets pile up their bricks stuff how solemn beautiful is thought that earliest pioneer civilization van leader civilization is never steamboat never railroad never newspaper never sabbath school never missionary but always whiskey such is case look history over you will see missionary comes after whiskey i mean he arrives after whiskey has arrived next comes poor immigrant with ax hoe rifle next trader next

van leader this beneficent work it always is it was like foreigner excusable foreigner be ignorant this great truth wander off into astronomy borrow symbol but if he had been conversant with facts he would have said westward jug empire takes its way this great van leader arrived upon ground which st paul now occupies june 1837 yes at that date pierre parrant canadian built first cabin uncorked his

bear lake is most idiotic indian legend i would resist temptation print it here if i could but task is beyond my strength guide book names preserver legend compliments his facile pen without further comment or delay then let us turn said facile pen loose upon reader legend white bear lake every spring for perhaps century or as long as there has been nation red men island middle white bear lake has been visited by band indians for purpose making maple sugar tradition says that many springs ago while upon this island young warrior loved wooed daughter his chief it is said also maiden loved warrior he had again again been refused her hand by her parents old chief alleging that he was no brave his old consort called him woman sun had again set upon sugar bush bright moon rose high bright blue heavens when young warrior took down his flute went out alone once more sing story his love mild breeze gently moved two gay feathers his head dress as he mounted on trunk leaning tree damp snow fell from his feet heavily as he raised his flute his lips his blanket slipped from his well formed shoulders lay partly on snow beneath he began his weird wild love song but soon felt that he was cold as he reached back for his blanket some unseen hand laid it gently on his shoulders it was hand his love his guardian angel she took her place beside him for present they were happy for indian has heart love this pride he is as noble as his own freedom which makes him child forest as legend runs large white bear thinking perhaps that polar snows dismal winter weather extended everywhere took up his journey southward he at length approached northern shore lake which now bears his name walked down bank made his way noiselessly through deep heavy snow toward island it was same spring ensuing that lovers met they had left their first retreat were now seated among branches large elm which hung far over lake same tree is still standing excites universal curiosity interest for fear being detected they talked almost whisper now that they might get back camp good time thereby avoid suspicion they were just rising return when maiden uttered shriek which was heard at camp bounding toward young brave she caught his blanket but missed direction her foot fell bearing blanket with her into great arms ferocious monster instantly every man woman child band were upon bank but all unarmed cries wailings went up from every mouth what was be done meantime this white savage beast held breathless maiden his huge grasp fondled with his precious prey as if he were used scenes like this one deafening yell from lover warrior is heard above cries hundreds his tribe dashing away his wigwam he grasps his faithful knife returns almost at single bound scene fear fright rushes out along leaning tree spot where his treasure fell springing with fury mad panther pounced upon his prey animal turned with one stroke his huge paw brought lovers heart heart but next moment warrior with one plunge blade his knife opened crimson sluices death dying bear relaxed his hold that night there was no more sleep for band or lovers as young old danced about carcass dead monster gallant warrior was presented with another plume ere another moon had set he had living treasure added his heart their children for many years played upon skin white bear from which lake derives its name maiden brave remembered long fearful scene rescue that made them one for kis se me pa ka go ka could never forget their fearful encounter with huge monster that came so near sending them happy hunting ground it is perplexing business first she fell down out tree she blanket bear caught her fondled her her blanket then she fell up into tree again leaving blanket meantime lover goes war whooping home comes back heeled climbs tree jumps down on bear girl jumps down after him apparently for she was up tree resumes her place bear s arms along with blanket lover rams his knife into bear saves whom blanket no nothing sort you get yourself all worked up excited about that blanket then all sudden just when happy climax seems imminent you are let down flat nothing saved but girl whereas one is not interested girl she is not prominent feature legend nevertheless there you are left there you must remain for if you live thousand years you will never know who got blanket dead man could get up better legend than this one i don t mean fresh dead man either i mean man that s been dead weeks weeks we struck home trail now few hours were that astonishing chicago city where they are always rubbing lamp fetching up genii contriving achieving new impossibilities it is hopeless for occasional visitor try keep up with chicago she outgrows his prophecies faster than he can make them she is always novelty for she is never chicago you saw when you passed through last time pennsylvania road rushed us new york without missing schedule time ten minutes anywhere on route there ended one most enjoyable five thousand mile journeys i have ever had good fortune make appendix appendix from new orleans times democrat march 29 1882 voyage times democrat s relief boat through inundated regions it was nine o clock thursday morning when susie left mississippi entered old river or what is now called mouth red ascending on left flood was pouring through over levees on chandler plantation most northern point pointe coupee parish water completely covered place although levees had given way but short time before stock had been gathered large flat boat where without food as we passed animals were huddled together waiting for boat tow them off on right hand side river is turnbull s island on it is large plantation which formerly was pronounced one most fertile state water has hitherto allowed it go scot free usual floods but now broad sheets water told only where fields were top protecting levee could be seen here there but nearly all it was submerged trees have put on greener foliage since water has poured woods look bright fresh but this pleasant aspect eye is neutralized by interminable waste water we pass mile after mile it is nothing but trees standing up their branches water water turkey now again rises flies ahead into long avenue silence pirogue sometimes flits from bushes crosses red river on its way out mississippi but sad faced paddlers never turn their heads look at our boat puffing boat is music this gloom which affects one most curiously it is not gloom deep forests or dark caverns but peculiar kind solemn silence impressive awe that holds one perforce its recognition we passed two negro families on raft tied up willows this morning they were evidently well do class as they had supply meal three or four hogs with them their rafts were about twenty feet square front improvised shelter earth had been placed on which they built their fire current running down atchafalaya was very swift mississippi showing predilection that direction which needs only be seen enforce opinion that river s desperate endeavors find short way gulf small boats skiffs pirogues etc are great demand many have been stolen by piratical negroes who take them where they will bring greatest price from what was told me by mr c p ferguson planter near red river landing whose place has just gone under there is much suffering rear that place negroes had given up all thoughts crevasse there as upper levee had stood so long when it did come they were at its mercy on thursday number were taken out trees off cabin roofs brought many yet remaining one does not appreciate sight earth until he has traveled through flood at sea one does not expect or look for it but here with fluttering leaves shadowy forest aisles house tops barely visible it is expected fact grave yard if mounds were above water would be appreciated river here is known only because there is opening trees that is all it is width from fort adams on left bank mississippi bank rapides parish distance about sixty miles large portion this was under cultivation particularly along mississippi back red when red river proper was entered strong current was running directly across it pursuing same direction as that mississippi after run some hours black river was reached hardly was it entered before signs suffering became visible all willows along banks were stripped their leaves one man whom your correspondent spoke said that he had had one hundred fifty head cattle one hundred head hogs at first appearance water he had started drive them high lands avoyelles thirty five miles off but he lost fifty head beef cattle sixty hogs black river is quite picturesque even if its shores are under water dense growth ash oak gum hickory make shores almost impenetrable where one can get view down some avenue trees only dim outlines distant trunks can be barely distinguished gloom few miles up this river depth water on banks was fully eight feet on all sides could be seen still holding against strong current tops cabins here there one overturned was surrounded by drift wood forming nucleus possibly some future island order save coal as it was impossible get that fuel at any point be touched during expedition look out was kept for wood pile on rounding point pirogue skilfully paddled by youth shot out its bow was girl fifteen fair face beautiful black eyes demure manners boy asked for paper which was thrown him couple pushed their tiny craft out into swell boat presently little girl not certainly over twelve years paddled out smallest little canoe handled it with all deftness old voyageur little one looked more like indian than white child laughed when asked if she were afraid she had been raised pirogue could go anywhere she was bound out pick willow leaves for stock she pointed house near by with water three inches deep on floors at its back door was moored raft about thirty feet square with sort fence built upon it inside this some sixteen cows twenty hogs were standing family did not complain except on account losing their stock promptly brought supply wood flat from this point mississippi river fifteen miles there is not spot earth above water westward for thirty five miles there is nothing but river s flood black river had risen during thursday 23rd 1 three quarters inches was going up at night still as we progress up river habitations become more frequent but are yet still miles apart nearly all them are deserted out houses floated off add gloom almost every living thing seems have departed not whistle bird nor bark squirrel can be heard this solitude sometimes morose gar will throw his tail aloft disappear river but beyond this everything is quiet quiet dissolution down river floats now neatly whitewashed hen house then cluster neatly split fence rails or door bloated carcass solemnly guarded by pair buzzards only bird be seen which feast on carcass as it bears them along picture frame which there was cheap lithograph soldier on horseback as it floated on told some hearth invaded by water despoiled this ornament at dark as it was not prudent run place alongside woods was hunted tall gum tree boat was made fast for night pretty quarter moon threw pleasant light over forest river making picture that would be delightful piece landscape study could artist only hold it down his canvas motion engines had ceased puffing escaping steam was stilled enveloping silence closed upon us such silence it was usually forest at night one can hear piping frogs hum insects or dropping limbs but here nature was dumb dark recesses those aisles into this cathedral gave forth no sound even ripplings current die away at daylight friday morning all hands were up up black we started morning was beautiful one river which is remarkably straight put on its loveliest garb blossoms haw perfumed air deliciously few birds whistled blithely along banks trees were larger forest seemed older growth than below more fields were passed than nearer mouth but same scene presented itself smoke houses drifting out pastures negro quarters anchored confusion against some oak modest residence just showing its eaves above water sun came up glory carmine trees were brilliant their varied shades green not foot soil is be seen anywhere water is apparently growing deeper deeper for it reaches up branches largest trees all along bordering willows have been denuded leaves showing how long people have been at work gathering this fodder for their animals old man pirogue was asked how willow leaves agreed with his cattle he stopped his work with ominous shake his head replied well sir it s enough keep warmth their bodies that s all we expect but it s hard on hogs particularly small ones they is dropping off powerful fast but what can you do it s all we ve got at thirty miles above mouth black river water extends from natchez on mississippi across pine hills louisiana distance seventy three miles there is hardly spot that is not ten feet under it tendency current up black is toward west fact so much is this case waters red river have been driven down from toward calcasieu country waters black enter red some fifteen miles above mouth former thing never before seen by even oldest steamboatmen water now sight us is entirely from mississippi up trinity or rather troy which is but short distance below people have nearly all moved out those remaining having enough for their present personal needs their cattle though are suffering dying off quite fast as confinement on rafts food they get breeds disease after short stop we started soon came section where there were many open fields cabins thickly scattered about here were seen more pictures distress on inside houses inmates had built on boxes scaffold on which they placed furniture bed posts were sawed off on top as ceiling was not more than four feet from improvised floor buildings looked very insecure threatened every moment float off near houses were cattle standing breast high water perfectly impassive they did not move their places but stood patiently waiting for help come sight was distressing one poor creatures will be sure die unless speedily rescued cattle differ from horses this peculiar quality horse after finding no relief comes will swim off search food whereas beef will stand its tracks until with exhaustion it drops water drowns at half past twelve o clock hail was given from flat boat inside line bank rounding we ran alongside general york stepped aboard he was just then engaged getting off stock welcomed times democrat boat heartily as he said there was much need for her he said that distress was not exaggerated least people were condition it was difficult even for one imagine water was so high there was great danger their houses being swept away it had already risen so high that it was approaching eaves when it reaches this point there is always imminent risk their being swept away if this occurs there will be great loss life general spoke gallant work many people their attempts save their stock but thought that fully twenty five per cent had perished already twenty five hundred people had received rations from troy on black river he had towed out great many cattle but very great quantity remained were dire need water was now eighteen inches higher than 1874 there was no land between vidalia hills catahoula at two o clock susie reached troy sixty five miles above mouth black river here on left comes little river just beyond that ouachita on right tensas these three rivers form black river troy or portion it is situated on around three large indian mounds circular shape which rise above present water about twelve feet they are about one hundred fifty feet diameter are about two hundred yards apart houses are all built between these mounds hence are all flooded depth eighteen inches on their floors these elevations built by aborigines hundreds years ago are only points refuge for miles when we arrived we found them crowded with stock all which was thin hardly able stand up they were mixed together sheep hogs horses mules cattle one these mounds has been used for many years as grave yard day we saw attenuated cows lying against marble tomb stones chewing their cud contentment after meal corn furnished by general york here as below remarkable skill women girls management smaller pirogues was noticed children were paddling about these most ticklish crafts with all nonchalance adepts general york has put into operation perfect system regard furnishing relief he makes personal inspection place where it is asked sees what is necessary be done then having two boats chartered with flats sends them promptly place when cattle are loaded towed pine hills uplands catahoula he has made troy his headquarters this point boats come for their supply feed for cattle on opposite side little river which branches left out black between it ouachita is situated town trinity which is hourly threatened with destruction it is much lower than troy water is eight nine feet deep houses strong current sweeps through it it is remarkable that all its houses have not gone before residents both troy trinity have been cared for yet some their stock have be furnished with food as soon as susie reached troy she was turned over general york placed at his disposition carry out work relief more rapidly nearly all her supplies were landed on one mounds lighten her she was headed down stream relieve those below at tom hooper s place few miles from troy large flat with about fifty head stock on board was taken tow animals were fed soon regained some strength day we go on little river where suffering is greatest down black river saturday evening march 25 we started down black river quite early under direction general york bring out what stock could be reached going down river flat tow was left central locality from there men poled her back rear plantations picking up animals wherever found loft gin house there were seventeen head found after gangway was built they were led down into flat without difficulty taking skiff with general your reporter was pulled up little house two rooms which water was standing two feet on floors one large rooms were huddled horses cows place while other widow taylor her son were seated on scaffold raised on floor one or two dug outs were drifting about roam ready be put service at any time when flat was brought up side house was cut away as only means getting animals out cattle were driven on board boat general york this as every case inquired if family desired leave informing them that major burke times democrat has sent susie up for that purpose mrs taylor said she thanked major burke but she would try hold out remarkable tenacity people here their homes is beyond all comprehension just below at point sixteen miles from troy information was received that house mr tom ellis was danger his family were all it we steamed there immediately sad picture was presented looking out half window left above water was mrs ellis who is feeble health whilst at door were her seven children oldest not fourteen years one side house was given up work animals some twelve head besides hogs next room family lived water coming within two inches bed rail stove was below water cooking was done on fire on top it house threatened give way at any moment one end it was sinking fact building looked mere shell as boat rounded mr ellis came out dug out general york told him that he had come his relief that times democrat boat was at his service would remove his family at once hills on monday flat would take out his stock as until that time they would be busy notwithstanding deplorable situation himself family were mr ellis did not want leave he said he thought he would wait until monday take risk his house falling children around door looked perfectly contented seeming care little for danger they were these are but two instances many after weeks privation suffering people still cling their houses leave only when there is not room between water ceiling build scaffold on which stand it seemed be incomprehensible yet love for old place was stronger than that for safety after leaving ellis place next spot touched at was oswald place here flat was towed alongside gin house where there were fifteen head standing water yet as they stood on scaffolds their heads were above top entrance it was found impossible get them out without cutting away portion front so axes were brought into requisition gap made after much labor horses mules were securely placed on flat at each place we stop there are always three four or more dug outs arriving bringing information stock other places need notwithstanding fact that great many had driven part their stock hills some time ago there yet remains large quantity which general york who is working with indomitable energy will get landed pine hills by tuesday all along black river susie has been visited by scores planters whose tales are repetition those already heard suffering loss old planter who has lived on river since 1844 said there never was such rise he was satisfied more than one quarter stock has been lost luckily people cared first for their work stock when they could find it horses mules were housed place safety rise which still continues was two inches last night compels them get them out hills hence it is that work general york is such great value from daylight late at night he is going this way that cheering by his kindly words directing with calm judgment what is be done one unpleasant story certain merchant new orleans is told all along river it appears for some years past planters have been dealing with this individual many them had balances his hands when overflow came they wrote for coffee for meal fact for such little necessities as were required no response these letters came others were written yet these old customers with plantations under water were refused even what was necessary sustain life it is needless say he is not popular now on back river hills spoken as place refuge for people stock on black river are catahoula parish twenty four miles from black river after filling flat with cattle we took on board family t s hooper seven number who could not longer remain their dwelling we are now taking them up little river hills flood still rising troy march 27 1882 noon flood here is rising about three half inches every twenty four hours rains have set which will increase this general york feels now that our efforts ought be directed towards saving life as increase water has jeopardized many houses we intend go up tensas few minutes then we will return go down black river take off families there is lack steam transportation here meet emergency general has three boats chartered with flats tow but demand for these tow out stock is greater than they can meet with promptness all are working night day susie hardly stops for more than hour anywhere rise has placed trinity dangerous plight momentarily it is expected that some houses will float off troy is little higher yet all are water reports have come that woman child have been washed away below here two cabins floated off their occupants are same who refused come off day before yesterday one would not believe utter passiveness people as yet no news has been received steamer delia which is supposed be one sunk yesterday s storm on lake catahoula she is due here now but has not arrived even mail here is most uncertain this i send by skiff natchez get it you it is impossible get accurate data as past crops etc as those who know much about matter have gone those who remain are not well versed production this section general york desires me say that amount rations formerly sent should be duplicated sent at once it is impossible make any estimate for people are fleeing hills so rapid is rise residents here are state commotion that can only be appreciated when seen complete demoralization has set if rations are drawn for any particular section hereabouts they would not be certain be distributed so everything should be sent troy as center general will have it properly disposed he has sent for one hundred tents if all go hills who are motion now two hundred will be required appendix b mississippi river commission condition this rich valley lower mississippi immediately after since war constituted one disastrous effects war most be deplored fictitious property slaves was not only righteously destroyed but very much work which had depended upon slave labor was also destroyed or greatly impaired especially levee system it might have been expected by those who have not investigated subject that such important improvements as construction maintenance levees would have been assumed at once by several states but what can state do where people are under subjection rates interest ranging from 18 30 per cent are also under necessity pledging their crops advance even planting at these rates for privilege purchasing all their supplies at 100 per cent profit it has needed but little attention make it perfectly obvious that control mississippi river if undertaken at all must be undertaken by national government cannot be compassed by states river must be treated as unit its control cannot be compassed under divided or separate system administration neither are states especially interested competent combine among themselves for necessary operations work must begin far up river at least as far as cairo if not beyond must be conducted upon consistent general plan throughout course river it does not need technical or scientific knowledge comprehend elements case if one will give little time attention subject when mississippi river commission has been constituted as existing commission is thoroughly able men different walks life may it not be suggested that their verdict case should be accepted as conclusive so far as any priori theory construction or control can be considered conclusive it should be remembered that upon this board are general gilmore general comstock general suter united states engineers professor henry mitchell most competent authority on question hydrography united states coast survey b b harrod state engineer louisiana jas b eads whose success with jetties at new orleans is warrant his competency judge taylor indiana it would be presumption on part any single man however skilled contest judgment such board as this method improvement proposed by commission is at once accord with results engineering experience with observations nature where meeting our wants as nature growth trees their proneness where undermined fall across slope support bank secures at some points fair depth channel some degree permanence so project engineer use timber brush encouragement forest growth are main features it is proposed reduce width where excessive by brushwood dykes at first low but raised higher higher as mud river settles under their shelter finally slope them back at angle upon which willows will grow freely this work there are many details connected with forms these shelter dykes their arrangements so as present series settling basins etc description which would only complicate conception through larger part river works contraction will not be required but nearly all banks on concave side beds must be held against wear stream much opposite banks defended at critical points works having view this conservative object may be generally designated works revetment these also will be largely brushwood woven continuous carpets or twined into wire netting this veneering process has been successfully employed on missouri river some cases they have so covered themselves with sediments have become so overgrown with willows that they may be regarded as permanent securing these mats rubble stone is be used small quantities some instances dressed slope between high low river will have be more or less paved with stone any one who has been on rhine will have observed operations not unlike those which we have just referred indeed most rivers europe flowing among their own alluvia have required similar treatment interest navigation agriculture levee is crowning work bank revetment although not necessarily immediate connection it may be set back short distance from revetted bank but it is effect requisite parapet flood river low river cannot be brought into register compelled unite excavation single permanent channel without complete control all stages even abnormal rise must be provided against because this would endanger levee once force behind works revetment would tear them also away under general principle that local slope river is result measure resistance its bed it is evident that narrow deep stream should have less slope because it has less frictional surface proportion capacity i e less perimeter proportion area cross section ultimate effect levees revetments confining floods bringing all stages river into register is deepen channel let down slope first effect levees is raise surface but this by inducing greater velocity flow inevitably causes enlargement section if this enlargement is prevented from being made at expense banks bottom must give way form waterway be so improved as admit this flow with less rise actual experience with levees upon mississippi river with no attempt hold banks has been favorable no one can doubt upon evidence furnished reports commission that if earliest levees had been accompanied by revetment banks made complete we should have day river navigable at low water adjacent country safe from inundation course it would be illogical conclude that constrained river can ever lower its flood slope so as make levees unnecessary but it is believed that by this lateral constraint river as conduit may be so improved form that even those rare floods which result from coincident rising many tributaries will find vent without destroying levees ordinary height that actual capacity channel through alluvium depends upon its service during floods has been often shown but this capacity does not include anomalous but recurrent floods it is hardly worth while consider projects for relieving mississippi river floods by creating new outlets since these sensational propositions have commended themselves only unthinking minds have no support among engineers were river bed cast iron resort openings for surplus waters might be necessity but as bottom is yielding best form outlet is single deep channel as realizing least ratio perimeter area cross section there could not well be more unphilosophical method treatment than multiplication avenues escape foregoing statement attempt has been made condense as limited space as importance subject would permit general elements problem general features proposed method improvement which has been adopted by mississippi river commission writer cannot help feeling that it is somewhat presumptuous on his part attempt present facts relating enterprise which calls for highest scientific skill but it is matter which interests every citizen united states is one methods reconstruction which ought be approved it is war claim which implies no private gain no compensation except for one cases destruction incident war which may well be repaired by people whole country edward atkinson boston april 14 1882 appendix c reception captain basil hall s book united states having now arrived nearly at end our travels i am induced ere i conclude again mention what i consider as one most remarkable traits national character americans namely their exquisite sensitiveness soreness respecting everything said or written concerning them this perhaps most remarkable example i can give is effect produced on nearly every class readers by appearance captain basil hall s travels north america fact it was sort moral earthquake vibration it occasioned through nerves republic from one corner union other was by no means over when i left country july 1831 couple years after shock i was cincinnati when these volumes came out but it was not till july 1830 that i procured copy them one bookseller whom i applied told me that he had had few copies before he understood nature work but that after becoming acquainted with it nothing should induce him sell another other persons his profession must however have been less scrupulous for book was read city town village hamlet steamboat stage coach sort war whoop was sent forth perfectly unprecedented my recollection upon any occasion whatever ardent desire for approbation delicate sensitiveness under censure have always i believe been considered as amiable traits character but condition into which appearance captain hall s work threw republic shows plainly that these feelings if carried excess produce weakness which amounts imbecility it was perfectly astonishing hear men who on other subjects were some judgment utter their opinions upon this i never heard any instance which commonsense generally found national criticism was so overthrown by passion i do not speak want justice fair liberal interpretation these perhaps were hardly be expected other nations have been called thin skinned but citizens union have apparently no skins at all they wince if breeze blows over them unless it be tempered with adulation it was not therefore very surprising that acute forcible observations traveler they knew would be listened should be received testily extraordinary features business were first excess rage into which they lashed themselves secondly puerility inventions by which they attempted account for severity with which they fancied they had been treated not content with declaring that volumes contained no word truth from beginning end which is assertion i heard made very nearly as often as they were mentioned whole country set work discover causes why captain hall had visited united states why he had published his book i have heard it said with as much precision gravity as if statement had been conveyed by official report that captain hall had been sent out by british government expressly for purpose checking growing admiration england for government united states that it was by commission from treasury he had come that it was only obedience orders that he had found anything object i do not give this as gossip coterie i am persuaded that it is belief very considerable portion country so deep is conviction this singular people that they cannot be seen without being admired that they will not admit possibility that any one should honestly sincerely find aught disapprove them or their country american reviews are many them i believe well known england i need not therefore quote them here but i sometimes wondered that they none them ever thought translating obadiah s curse into classic american if they had done so on placing he basil hall between brackets instead he obadiah it would have saved them world trouble i can hardly describe curiosity with which i sat down at length peruse these tremendous volumes still less can i do justice my surprise at their contents say that i found not one exaggerated statement throughout work is by no means saying enough it is impossible for any one who knows country not see that captain hall earnestly sought out things admire commend when he praises it is with evident pleasure when he finds fault it is with evident reluctance restraint excepting where motives purely patriotic urge him state roundly what it is for benefit his country should be known fact captain hall saw country greatest possible advantage furnished course with letters introduction most distinguished individuals with still more influential recommendation his own reputation he was received full drawing room style state from one end union other he saw country full dress had little or no opportunity judging it unhouselled unanointed unannealed with all its imperfections on its head as i my family too often had captain hall had certainly excellent opportunities making himself acquainted with form government laws receiving moreover best oral commentary upon them conversation with most distinguished citizens these opportunities he made excellent use nothing important met his eye which did not receive that sort analytical attention which experienced philosophical traveler alone can give this has made his volumes highly interesting valuable but i am deeply persuaded that were man equal penetration visit united states with no other means becoming acquainted with national character than ordinary working day intercourse life he would conceive infinitely lower idea moral atmosphere country than captain hall appears have done internal conviction on my mind is strong that if captain hall had not placed firm restraint on himself he must have given expression far deeper indignation than any he has uttered against many points american character with which he shows from other circumstances that he was well acquainted his rule appears have been state just so much truth as would leave on mind his readers correct impression at least cost pain sensitive folks he was writing about he states his own opinions feelings leaves it be inferred that he has good grounds for adopting them but he spares americans bitterness which detail circumstances would have produced if any one chooses say that some wicked antipathy twelve millions strangers is origin my opinion i must bear it were question one mere idle speculation i certainly would not court abuse i must meet for stating it but it is not so candor which he expresses evidently feels they mistake for irony or totally distrust his unwillingness give pain persons from whom he has received kindness they scornfully reject as affectation although they must know right well their own secret hearts how infinitely more they lay at his mercy than he has chosen betray they pretend even themselves that he has exaggerated bad points their character institutions whereas truth is that he has let them off with degree tenderness which may be quite suitable for him exercise however little merited while at same time he has most industriously magnified their merits whenever he could possibly find anything favorable appendix d undying head remote part north lived man his sister who had never seen human being seldom if ever had man any cause go from

bear was recovering from blows first he moved his paws soon they saw him rise on his feet old man shared fate first for they now heard his cries as he was torn pieces again monster was pursuit fast overtaking them not yet discouraged young men kept on their way but bear was now so close that leader once more applied his brothers but they could do nothing well said he my dreams will soon be exhausted after this i have but one more he advanced invoking his guardian spirit aid him once said he i dreamed that being sorely pressed i came large lake on shore which was canoe partly out water having ten paddles all readiness do not fear he cried we shall soon get it so it was even as he had said coming lake they saw canoe with ten paddles immediately they embarked scarcely had they reached center lake when they saw bear arrive at its borders lifting himself on his hind legs he looked all around then he waded into water then losing his footing he turned back commenced making circuit lake meantime party remained stationary center watch his movements he traveled all around till at last he came place from whence he started then he commenced drinking up water they saw current fast setting towards his open mouth leader encouraged them paddle hard for opposite shore when only short distance from land current had increased so much that they were drawn back by it all their efforts reach it were vain then leader again spoke telling them meet their fates manfully now is time mudjikewis said he show your prowess take courage sit at bow canoe when it approaches his mouth try what effect your club will have on his head he obeyed stood ready give blow while leader who steered directed canoe for open mouth monster rapidly advancing they were just about enter his mouth when mudjikewis struck him tremendous blow on head gave saw saw quan bear s limbs doubled under him he fell stunned by blow but before mudjikewis could renew it monster disgorged all water he had drank with force which sent canoe with great velocity opposite shore instantly leaving canoe again they fled on they went till they were completely exhausted earth again shook soon they saw monster hard after them their spirits drooped they felt discouraged leader exerted himself by actions words cheer them up once more he asked them if they thought nothing or could do nothing for their rescue as before all were silent then he said this is last time i can apply my guardian spirit now if we do not succeed our fates are decided he ran forward invoking his spirit with great earnestness gave yell we shall soon arrive said he his brothers at place where my last guardian spirit dwells him i place great confidence do not do not be afraid or your limbs will be fear bound we shall soon reach his lodge run run he cried returning now iamo he had passed all time same condition we had left him head directing his sister order procure food where place magic arrows speaking at long intervals one day sister saw eyes head brighten as if with pleasure at last it spoke oh sister it said what pitiful situation you have been cause placing me soon very soon party young men will arrive apply me for aid but alas how can i give what i would have done with so much pleasure nevertheless take two arrows place them where you have been habit placing others have meat prepared cooked before they arrive when you hear

then she cried for help young men came rushing out having partially regained their strength spirits mudjikewis stepping up gave yell struck him blow upon head this he repeated till it seemed like mass brains while others as quick as possible cut him into very small pieces which they then scattered every direction while thus employed happening look around where they had thrown meat wonderful behold they saw starting up turning off every direction small black bears such as are seen at present day country was soon overspread with these black animals it was from this monster that present race bears derived their origin having thus overcome their pursuer they returned lodge meantime woman gathering implements she had used head placed them again sack but head did not speak again probably from its great exertion overcome monster having spent so much time traversed so vast country their flight young men gave up idea ever returning their own country game being plenty they determined remain where

my death we suffer before we think it is common lot humanity i experienced more than my proportion it i have no knowledge what passed prior my fifth or sixth year i recollect nothing learning read i only remember what effect first considerable exercise it produced on my mind from that moment i date uninterrupted knowledge myself every night after supper we read some part small collection romances which had been my mother s my father s design was only improve me reading he thought these entertaining works were calculated give me fondness for it but we soon found ourselves so interested adventures they contained that we alternately read whole nights together could not bear give over until at conclusion volume sometimes morning on hearing swallows at our window my father quite ashamed this weakness would cry come come let us go bed i am more child than thou art i soon acquired by this dangerous custom not only extreme facility reading comprehending but for my age too intimate acquaintance with passions infinity sensations were familiar me without possessing any precise idea objects which they related i had conceived nothing i had felt whole this confused succession emotions did not retard future efforts my reason though they added extravagant romantic notion human life which experience reflection have never been able eradicate my romance reading concluded with summer 1719 following winter was differently employed my mother s library being quite exhausted we had recourse that part her father s which had devolved us here we happily found some valuable books which was by no means extraordinary having been selected by minister that truly deserved that title whom learning which was rage times was but secondary commendation his taste good sense being most conspicuous history church empire by le sueur bossuett s discourses on universal history plutarch s lives history venice by nani ovid s metamorphoses la bruyere fontenelle s world his dialogues dead few volumes moliere were soon ranged my father s closet where during hours he was employed his business i daily read them with avidity taste uncommon perhaps unprecedented at my age plutarch presently became my greatest favorite satisfaction i derived from repeated readings i gave this author extinguished my passion for romances i shortly preferred agesilaus brutus aristides orondates artemenes juba these interesting studies seconded by conversations they frequently occasioned with my father produced that republican spirit love liberty that haughty invincible turn mind which rendered me impatient restraint or servitude became torment my life as i continually found myself situations incompatible with these sentiments incessantly occupied with rome athens conversing if i may so express myself with their illustrious heroes born citizen republic father whose ruling passion was love his country i was fired with these examples could fancy myself greek or roman readily give into character personage whose life i read transported by recital any extraordinary instance fortitude or intrepidity animation flashed from my eyes gave my voice additional strength energy one day at table while relating fortitude scoevola they were terrified at seeing me start from my seat hold my hand over hot chafing dish represent more forcibly action that determined roman my brother who was seven years older than myself was brought up my father s profession extraordinary affection they lavished on me might be reason he was too much neglected this certainly was fault which cannot be justified his education morals suffered by this neglect he acquired habits libertine before he arrived at age be really one my father tried what effect placing him with master would produce but he still persisted same ill conduct though i saw him so seldom that it could hardly be said we were acquainted i loved him tenderly believe he had as strong affection for me as youth his dissipated turn mind could be supposed capable one day i remember when my father was correcting him severely i threw myself between them embracing my brother whom i covered with my body receiving strokes designed for him i persisted so obstinately my protection that either softened by my cries tears or fearing hurt me most his anger subsided he pardoned his fault end my brother s conduct became so bad that he suddenly disappeared we learned some time after that he was germany but he never wrote us from that day we heard no news him thus i became only son if this poor lad was neglected it was quite different with his brother for children king could not be treated with more attention tenderness than were bestowed on my infancy being darling family what is rather uncommon though treated as beloved never spoiled child was never permitted while under paternal inspection play street with other children never had any occasion contradict or indulge those fantastical humors which are usually attributed nature but are reality effects injudicious education i had faults common my age was talkative glutton sometimes liar made no scruple stealing sweetmeats fruits or indeed any kind eatables but never took delight mischievous waste accusing others or tormenting harmless animals i recollect indeed that one day while madam clot neighbor ours was gone church i made water her kettle remembrance even now makes me smile for madame clot though if you please good sort creature was one most tedious grumbling old women i ever knew thus have i given brief but faithful history my childish transgressions how could i become cruel or vicious when i had before my eyes only examples mildness was surrounded by some best people world my father my aunt my nurse my relations our friends our neighbors all i had any connection with did not obey me it is true but loved me tenderly i returned their affection i found so little excite my desires those i had were so seldom contradicted that i was hardly sensible possessing any can solemnly aver i was absolute stranger caprice until after i had experienced authority master those hours that were not employed reading or writing with my father or walking with my governess jaqueline i spent with my aunt whether seeing her embroider or hearing her sing whether sitting or standing by her side i was ever happy her tenderness unaffected gayety charms her figure countenance have left such indelible impressions on my mind that her manner look attitude are still before my eyes i recollect thousand little caressing questions could describe her clothes her head dress nor have two curls fine black hair which hung on her temples according mode that time escaped my memory though my taste or rather passion for music did not show itself until considerable time after i am fully persuaded it is her i am indebted for it she knew great number songs which she sung with great sweetness melody serenity cheerfulness which were conspicuous this lovely girl banished melancholy made all round her happy charms her voice had such effect on me that not only several her songs have ever since remained on my memory but some i have not thought from my infancy as i grow old return upon my mind with charm altogether inexpressible would any one believe that old dotard like me worn out with care infirmity should sometime surprise himself weeping like child voice querulous broken by age muttering out one those airs which were favorites my infancy there is one song particular whose tune i perfectly recollect but words that compose latter half it constantly refuse every effort recall them though i have confused idea rhymes beginning with what i have been able recollect remainder is as follows tircis je n ose ecouter ton chalumeau sous l ormeau car on en cause deja dans notre hameau un berger s engager sans danger et toujours l epine est sons la rose i have endeavored account for invincible charm my heart feels on recollection this fragment but it is altogether inexplicable i only know that before i get end it i always find my voice interrupted by tenderness my eyes suffused with tears i have hundred times formed resolution writing paris for remainder these words if any one should chance know them but i am almost certain pleasure i take recollection would be greatly diminished was i assured any one but my poor aunt susan had sung them such were my affections on entering this life thus began form demonstrate itself heart at once haughty tender character effeminate yet invincible which fluctuating between weakness courage luxury virtue has ever set me contradiction myself causing abstinence enjoyment pleasure prudence equally shun me this course education was interrupted by accident whose consequences influenced rest my life my father had quarrel with m g who had captain s commission france was related several council this g who was insolent ungenerous man happening bleed at nose order be revenged accused my father having drawn his sword on him city consequence this charge they were about conduct him prison he insisted according law this republic that accuser should be confined at same time not being able obtain this preferred voluntary banishment for remainder his life giving up point by which he must sacrifice his honor liberty i remained under tuition my uncle bernard who was at that time employed fortifications geneva he had lost his eldest daughter but had son about my own age we were sent together bossey board with minister lambercier here we were learn latin with all insignificant trash that has obtained name education two years spent this village softened some degree my roman fierceness again reduced me state childhood at geneva where nothing was exacted i loved reading which was indeed my principal amusement but at bossey where application was expected i was fond play as relaxation country was so new so charming my idea that it seemed impossible find satiety its enjoyments i conceived passion for rural life which time has not been able extinguish nor have i ever ceased regret pure tranquil pleasures i enjoyed at this place my childhood remembrance having followed me through every age even that which i am hastening again towards it m lambercier was worthy sensible man who without neglecting our instruction never made our acquisitions burthensome or tasks tedious what convinces me rectitude his method is that notwithstanding my extreme aversion restraint recollection my studies is never attended with disgust if my improvement was trivial it was obtained with ease has never escaped memory simplicity this rural life was infinite advantage opening my heart reception true friendship sentiments i had hitherto formed on this subject were extremely elevated but altogether imaginary habit living this peaceful manner soon united me tenderly my cousin bernard my affection was more ardent than that i had felt for my brother nor has time ever been able efface it he was tall lank weakly boy with mind as mild as his body was feeble who did not wrong good opinion they were disposed entertain for son my guardian our studies amusements tasks were same we were alone each wanted playmate separate would some measure have been annihilate us though we had not many opportunities demonstrating our attachment each other it was certainly extreme so far from enduring thought separation we could not even form idea that we should ever be able submit it each disposition be won by kindness complaisant when not soured by contradiction we agreed every particular if by favor those who governed us he had ascendant while their presence i was sure acquire it when we were alone this preserved equilibrium so necessary friendship if he hesitated repeating his task i prompted him when my exercises were finished i helped write his our amusements my disposition being most active ever had lead word our characters accorded so well friendship that subsisted between us was so cordial that during five years we were at bossey geneva we were inseparable we often fought it is true but there never was any occasion separate us no one our quarrels lasted more than quarter hour never our lives did we make any complaint each other it may be said these remarks are frivolous but perhaps similiar example among children can hardly be produced manner which i passed my time at bossey was so agreeable my disposition that it only required longer duration absolutely have fixed my character which would have had only peaceable affectionate benevolent sentiments for its basis i believe no individual our kind ever possessed less natural vanity than myself at intervals by extraordinary effort i arrived at sublime ideas but presently sunk again into my original languor be loved by every one who knew me was my most ardent wish i was naturally mild my cousin was equally so those who had care us were similiar dispositions everything contributed strengthen those propensities which nature had implanted my breast during two years i was neither victim nor witness any violent emotions i knew nothing so delightful as see every one content not only with me but all that concerned them when repeating our catechism at church nothing could give me greater vexation on being obliged hesitate than see miss lambercier s countenance express disapprobation uneasiness this alone was more afflicting me than shame faltering before so many witnesses which notwithstanding was sufficiently painful for though not oversolicitous praise i was feelingly alive shame yet i can truly affirm dread being reprimanded by miss lambercier alarmed me less than thought making her uneasy neither she nor her brother were deficient reasonable severity but as this was scarce ever exerted without just cause i was more afflicted at their disapprobation than punishment certainly method treating youth would be altered if distant effects this indiscriminate frequently indiscreet method produces were more conspicuous i would willingly excuse myself from further explanation did not lesson this example conveys which points out evil as frequent as it is pernicious forbid my silence as miss lambercier felt mother s affection she sometimes exerted mother s authority even inflicting on us when we deserved it punishment infants she had often threatened it this threat treatment entirely new appeared me extremely dreadful but i found reality much less terrible than idea what is still more unaccountable this punishment increased my affection for person who had inflicted it all this affection aided by my natural mildness was scarcely sufficient prevent my seeking by fresh offences return same chastisement for degree sensuality had mingled with smart shame which left more desire than fear repetition i was well convinced same discipline from her brother would have produced quite contrary effect but from man his disposition this was not probable if i abstained from meriting correction it was merely from fear offending miss lambercier for benevolence aided by passions has ever maintained empire over me which has given law my heart this event which though desirable i had not endeavored accelerate arrived without my fault i should say without my seeking i profited by it with safe conscience but this second was also last time for miss lambercier who doubtless had some reason imagine this chastisement did not produce desired effect declared it was too fatiguing that she renounced it for future till now we had slept her chamber during winter even her bed but two days after another room was prepared for us from that moment i had honor which i could very well have dispensed with being treated by her as great boy who would believe this childish discipline received at eight years old from hands woman thirty should influence my propensities my desires my passions for rest my life that quite contrary sense from what might naturally have been expected very incident that inflamed my senses gave my desires such extraordinary turn that confined what i had already experienced i sought no further with blood boiling with sensuality almost from my birth preserved my purity beyond age when coldest constitutions lose their insensibility long tormented without knowing by what i gazed on every handsome woman with delight imagination incessantly brought their charms my remembrance only transform them into so many miss lamberciers if ever education was perfectly chaste it was certainly that i received my three aunts were not only exemplary prudence but maintained degree modest reserve which women have long since thought unnecessary my father it is true loved pleasure but his gallantry was rather last than present century he never expressed his affection for any woman he regarded terms virgin could have blushed at indeed it was impossible more attention should be paid that regard we owe morals children than was uniformly observed by every one i had any concern with equal degree reserve this particular was observed at m lambercier s where good maid servant was discharged for having once made use expression before us which was thought contain some degree indelicacy i had no precise idea ultimate effect passions but conception i had formed was extremely disgusting i entertained particular aversion for courtesans nor could i look on rake without degree disdain mingled with terror these prejudices education proper themselves retard first explosions combustible constitution were strengthened as i have already hinted by effect first moments sensuality produced me for notwithstanding troublesome ebullition my blood i was satisfied with species voluptuousness i had already been acquainted with sought no further thus i passed age puberty with constitution extremely ardent without knowing or even wishing for any other gratification passions than what miss lambercier had innocently given me idea when i became man that childish taste instead vanishing only associated with other this folly joined natural timidity has always prevented my being very enterprising with women so that i have passed my days languishing silence for those i most admired without daring disclose my wishes fall at feet imperious mistress obey her mandates or implore pardon were for me most exquisite enjoyments more my blood was inflamed by efforts lively imagination more i acquired appearance whining lover it will be readily conceived that this mode making love is not attended with rapid progress or imminent danger virtue its object yet though i have few favors boast i have not been excluded from enjoyment however imaginary thus senses concurrence with mind equally timid romantic have preserved my moral chaste feelings uncorrupted with precisely same inclinations which seconded with moderate portion effrontery might have plunged me into most unwarrantable excesses i have made first most difficult step obscure painful maze my confessions we never feel so great degree repugnance divulging what is really criminal as what is merely ridiculous i am now assured my resolution for after what i have dared disclose nothing can have power deter me difficulty attending these acknowledgments will be readily conceived when i declare that during whole my life though frequently laboring under most violent agitation being hurried away with impetuosity passion which when company with those i loved deprived me faculty sight hearing i could never course most unbounded familiarity acquire sufficient resolution declare my folly implore only favor that remained bestow thus investigating first traces my sensible existence i find elements which though seemingly incompatible have united produce simple uniform effect while others apparently same have by concurrence certain circumstances formed such different combinations that it would never be imagined they had any affinity who would believe for example that one most vigorous springs my soul was tempered identical source from whence luxury ease mingled with my constitution circulated my veins before i quit this subject i will add striking instance different effects they produced one day while i was studying chamber contiguous kitchen maid set some miss lambercier s combs dry by fire on coming fetch them some time after was surprised find teeth one them broken off who could be suspected this mischief no one but myself had entered room i was questioned but denied having any knowledge it mr miss lambercier consult exhort threaten but all no purpose i obstinately persist denial though this was first time i had been detected confirmed falsehood appearances were so strong that they overthrew all my protestations this affair was thought serious mischief lie obstinacy were considered equally deserving punishment which was not now be administered by miss lambercier my uncle bernard was written he arrived my poor cousin being charged with crime no less serious we were conducted same execution which was inflicted with great severity if finding remedy evil itself they had sought ever allay my depraved desires they could not have chosen shorter method accomplish their designs i can assure my readers i was for long time freed from dominion them as this severity could not draw from me expected acknowledgment which obstinacy brought on several repetitions reduced me deplorable situation yet i was immovable resolutely determined suffer death rather than submit force at length was obliged yield diabolical infatuation child for no better name was bestowed on my constancy i came out this dreadful trial torn it is true but triumphant fifty years have expired since this adventure fear punishment is no more well then i aver face heaven i was absolutely innocent so far from breaking or even touching comb never came near fire it will be asked how did this mischief happen i can form no conception it i only know my own innocence let any one figure himself character whose leading traits were docility timidity but haughty ardent invincible its passions child hitherto governed by voice reason treated with mildness equity complaisance who could not even support idea injustice experiencing for first time so violent instance it inflicted by those he most loved respected what perversion ideas what confusion heart brain all my little being intelligent moral let any one i say if possible imagine all this for i am incapable giving least idea what passed my mind at that period my reason was not sufficiently established enable me put myself place others judge how much appearances condemned me i only beheld rigor dreadful chastisement inflicted for crime i had not committed yet i can truly affirm smart i suffered though violent was inconsiderable compared what i felt from indignation rage despair my cousin who was almost similar circumstances having been punished for involuntary fault as guilty premediated crime became furious by my example both same bed we embraced each other with convulsive transport we were almost suffocated when our young hearts found sufficient relief breathe out our indigination we sat up bed with all our force repeated hundred times carnifex carnifex carnifex executioner tormentor even while i write this i feel my pulse quicken should i live hundred thousand years agitation that moment would still be fresh my memory first instance violence oppression is so deeply engraved on my soul that every relative idea renews my emotion sentiment indignation which its origin had reference only myself has acquired such strength is at present so completely detached from personal motives that my heart is as much inflamed at sight or relation any act injustice whatever may be object or wheresoever it may be perpetrated as if i was immediate sufferer when i read history merciless tyrant or dark subtle machination knavish designing priest i could on instant set off stab miscreants though i was certain perish attempt i have frequently fatigued myself by running after stoning cock cow dog or any animal i saw tormenting another only because it was conscious possessing superior strength this may be natural me i am inclined believe it is though lively impression first injustice i became victim was too long too powerfully remembered not have added considerable force it this occurrence terminated my infantine serenity from that moment i ceased enjoy pure unadulterated happiness on retrospection pleasure my childhood i yet feel they ended here we continue at bossey some months after this event but were like our first parents garden eden after they had lost their innocence appearance our situation was same effect it was totally different affection respect intimacy confidence no longer attached pupils their guides we beheld them no longer as divinities who could read secrets our hearts we were less ashamed committing faults more afraid being accused them we learned dissemble rebel lie all vices common our years began corrupt our happy innocence mingle with our sports embitter our amusements country itself losing those sweet simple charms which captivate heart appeared gloomy desert or covered with veil that concealed its beauties we cultivated our little gardens no more our flowers were neglected we no longer scratched away mould broke out into exclamations delight on discovering that grain we had sown began shoot we were disgusted with our situation our preceptors were weary us word my uncle wrote for our return we left mr miss lambercier without feeling any regret at separation near thirty years passed away from my leaving bossey without once recalling place my mind with any degree satisfaction but after having passed prime life as i decline into old age while more recent occurrences are wearing out apace i feel these remembrances revive imprint themselves on my heart with force charm that every day acquires fresh strength as if feeling life fleet from me i endeavored catch it again by its commencement most trifling incident those happy days delight me for no other reason than being those days i recall every circumstance time place persons i see maid or footman busy chamber swallow entering window fly settling on my hand while repeating my lessons i see whole economy apartment on right hand mr lambercier s closet with print representing all popes barometer large almanac windows house which stood hollow at bottom garden shaded by raspberry shrubs whose shoots sometimes found entrance i am sensible reader has no occasion know all this but i feel kind necessity for relating it why am i not permitted recount all little anecdotes that thrice happy age at recollection whose joys i ever tremble with delight five or six particularly let us compromise matter i will give up five but then i must have one only one provided i may draw it out its utmost length order prolong my satisfaction if i only sought yours i should choose that miss lambercier s backside which by unlucky fall at bottom meadow was exposed view king sardinia who happened be passing by but that walnut tree on terrace is more amusing me since here i was actor whereas abovementioned scene i was only spectator i must confess i see nothing that should

replacing round root each held tree with one hand singing songs triumph order water it with more effect they formed kind luson around its foot myself cousin who were every day ardent spectators this watering confirmed each other very natural idea that it was nobler plant trees on terrace than colors on breach this glory we were resolved procure without dividing it with any one pursuance this resolution we cut slip off willow planted it on terrace at about eight or ten feet distance from august walnut tree we did not forget make hollow round it but difficulty was how procure supply water which was brought from considerable distance we not permitted fetch it but water was absolutely necessary for our willow we made use every stratagem obtain it for few days everything succeeded so well that it began bud throw out small leaves which we hourly measured convinced tho now scarce foot from ground it would soon afford us refreshing shade this unfortunate willow by engrossing our whole time rendered us incapable application any other study cause our inattention not being known we were kept closer than before fatal moment approached when water must fail we were already afflicted with idea that our tree must perish with drought at length necessity parent industry suggested invention by which we might save our tree from death ourselves from despair it was make furrow underground which would privately conduct part water from walnut tree our willow this undertaking was executed with ardor but did not immediately succeed our descent was not skilfully planned water did not run earth falling stopping up furrow yet though all went contrary nothing discouraged us omnia vincit labor improbus we made bason deeper give water more sensible descent we cut bottom box into narrow planks increased channel from walnut tree our willow laying row flat at bottom set two others inclining towards each other so as form triangular channel we formed kind grating with small sticks at end next walnut tree prevent earth stones from stopping it up having carefully covered our work with well trodden earth transport hope fear attended hour watering after interval which seemed age expectation this hour arrived mr lambercier as usual assisted at operation we contrived get between him our tree towards which he fortunately turned his back they no sooner began pour first pail water than we perceived it running willow this sight was too much for our prudence we involuntarily expressed our transport by shout joy sudden exclamation made mr lambercier turn about though at that instant he was delighted observe how greedily earth which surrounded root his walnut tree imbibed water surprised at seeing two trenches partake it he shouted his turn examines perceives roguery sending instantly for pick axe at one fatal blow makes two or three our planks fly crying out meantime with all his strength aqueduct aqueduct his strokes redoubled every one which made impression on our hearts moment planks channel bason even our favorite willow all were ploughed up nor was one word pronounced during this terrible transaction except above mentioned exclamation aqueduct repeated he while destroying all our hopes aqueduct aqueduct it maybe supposed this adventure had still more melancholy end for young architects this however was not case affair ended here mr lambercier never reproached us on this account nor was his countenance clouded with frown we even heard him mention circumstance his sister with loud bursts laughter laugh mr lambercier might be heard considerable distance but what is still more surprising after first transport sorrow had subsided we did not find ourselves violently afflicted we planted tree another spot frequently recollected catastrophe former repeating with significant emphasis aqueduct aqueduct till then at intervals i had fits ambition could fancy myself brutus or aristides but this was first visible effect my vanity have constructed aqueduct with our own hands have set slip willow competition with flourishing tree appeared me supreme degree glory i had juster conception it at ten than caesar entertained at thirty idea this walnut tree with little anecdotes it gave rise have so well continued or returned my memory that design which conveyed most pleasing sensations during my journey geneva year 1754 was visiting bossey reviewing monuments my infantine amusement above all beloved walnut tree whose age at that time must have been verging on third century but i was so beset with company that i could not find moment accomplish my design there is little appearance now occasion being renewed but should i ever return that charming spot find my favorite walnut tree still existing i am convinced i should water it with my tears on my return geneva i passed two or three years at my uncle s expecting determination my friends respecting my future establishment his own son being devoted genius was taught drawing instructed by his father elements euclid i partook these instructions but was principally fond drawing meantime they were irresolute whether make me watchmaker lawyer or minister i should have preferred being minister as i thought it must be charming thing preach but trifling income which had been my mother s was be divided between my brother myself was too inconsiderable defray expense attending prosecution my studies as my age did not render choice very pressing i remained with my uncle passing my time with very little improvement paying pretty dear though not unreasonably for my board my uncle like my father was man pleasure but had not learned like him abridge his amusements for sake instructing his family consequently our education was neglected my aunt was devotee who loved singing psalms better than thinking our improvement so that we were left entirely ourselves which liberty we never abused ever inseparable we were all world each other feeling no inclination frequent company number disorderly lads our own age we learned none those habits libertinism which our idle life exposed us perhaps i am wrong charging myself cousin with idleness at this time for our lives we were never less so what was extremely fortunate so incessantly occupied with our amusements that we found no temptation spend any part our time streets we made cages pipes kites drums houses ships bows spoiled tools my good old grandfather by endeavoring make watches imitation him but our favorite amusement was wasting paper drawing washing coloring etc there came italian mountebank geneva called gamber corta who had exhibition puppets that he made play kind comedy we went once see them but could not spare time go again being busily employed making puppets our own inventing comedies which we immediately set about making them perform mimicking best our abilities uncouth voice punch complete business my good aunt uncle bernard had patience see listen our imitations but my uncle having one day read elaborate discourse his family we instantly gave up our comedies began composing sermons these details i confess are not very amusing but they serve demonstrate that former part our education was well directed since being at such early age absolute masters our time we found no inclination abuse it so little want other companions that we constantly neglected every occasion seeking them when taking our walks together we observed their diversions without feeling any inclination partake them friendship so entirely occupied our hearts that pleased with each other s company simplest pastimes were sufficient delight us we were soon remarked for being thus inseparable what rendered us more conspicuous my cousin was very tall myself extremely short so that we exhibited very whimsical contrast this meagre figure small sallow countenance heavy air supine gait excited ridicule children who gibberish country nicknamed him barna bredanna we no sooner got out doors than our ears were assailed with repetition barna bredanna he bore this indignity with tolerable patience but i was instantly for fighting this was what young rogues aimed at i engaged accordingly was beat my poor cousin did all his power assist me but he was weak single stroke brought him ground i then became furious received several smart blows some which were aimed at barna bredanna this quarrel so far increased evil that avoid their insults we could only show ourselves streets while they were employed at school i had already become redresser grievances there only wanted lady way be knight errant form this defect was soon supplied i presently had two i frequently went see my father at nion small city vaudois country where he was now settled being universally respected affection entertained for him extended me during my visits question seemed be who should show me most kindness madame de vulson particular loaded me with caresses complete all her daughter made me her gallant i need not explain what kind gallant boy eleven must be girl two twenty artful hussies know how set these puppets up front conceal more serious engagements on my part i saw no inequality between myself miss vulson was flattered by circumstance went into it with my whole heart or rather my whole head for this passion certainly reached no further though it transported me almost madness frequently produced scenes sufficient make even cynic expire with laughter i have experienced two kinds love equally real which have scarce any affinity yet each differing materially from tender friendship my whole life has been divided between these affections i have frequently felt power both at same instant for example at very time i so publically tyrannically claimed miss vulson that i could not suffer any other my sex approach her i had short but passionate assignations with miss goton who thought proper act schoolmistress with me our meetings though absolutely childish afforded me height happiness i felt whole charm mystery repaid miss vulson kind when she least expected it use she made me concealing her amours my great mortification this secret was soon discovered i presently lost my young schoolmistress miss goton was fact singular personage she was not handsome yet there was certain something her figure which could not easily be forgotten this for old fool i am too often convinced her eyes particular neither corresponded with her age her height nor her manner she had lofty imposing air which agreed extremely well with character she assumed but most extraordinary part her composition was mixture forwardness reserve difficult be conceived while she took greatest liberties with me would never permit any be taken with her return treating me precisely like child this makes me suppose she had either ceased herself be one or was yet sufficiently so behold as play danger which this folly exposed her i was so absolutely power both these mistresses that when presence either i never thought her who was absent other respects effects they produced on me bore no affinity i could have passed my whole life with miss vulson without forming wish quit her but then my satisfaction was attended with pleasing serenity numerous companies i was particularly charmed with her sprightly sallies her wit arch glance her eye even jealousy itself strengthened my attachment i triumphed preference she seemed bestow on me while addressed by more powerful rivals applause encouragement smiles gave animation my happiness surrounded by throng observers i felt whole force love i was passionate transported tete tete i should have been constrained thoughtful perhaps unhappy if miss vulson was ill i suffered with her would willingly have given up my own health establish hers observe i knew want it from experience if absent she employed my thoughts i felt want her when present her caresses came with warmth rapture my heart though my senses were unaffected familiarities she bestowed on me i could not have supported idea her granting another i loved her with brother s affection only but experienced all jealousy lover with miss goton this passion might have acquired degree fury i should have been turk tiger had i once imagined she bestowed her favors on any but myself pleasure i felt on approaching miss vulson was sufficiently ardent though unattended with uneasy sensations but at sight miss goton i felt myself bewildered every sense was absorbed ecstasy i believe it would have been impossible have remained long with her i must have been suffocated with violence my palpitations i equally dreaded giving either them displeasure with one i was more complaisant with other more submissive i would not have offended miss vulson for world but if miss goton had commanded me throw myself into flames i think i should have instantly obeyed her happily both for her myself our amours or rather rendezvous were not long duration though my connection with miss vulson was less dangerous after continuance some greater length that likewise had its catastrophe indeed termination love affair is good for nothing unless it partakes romantic can furnish out at least exclamation though my correspondence with miss vulson was less animated it was perhaps more endearing we never separated without tears it can hardly be conceived what void i felt my heart i could neither think nor speak anything but her these romantic sorrows were not affected though i am inclined believe they did not absolutely centre her for i am persuaded though i did not perceive it at that time being deprived amusement bore considerable share them soften rigor absence we agreed correspond with each other pathetic expressions these letters contained were sufficient have split rock word i had honor her not being able endure pain separation she came see me at geneva my head was now completely turned during two days she remained here i was intoxicated with delight at her departure i would have thrown myself into water after her absolutely rent air with my cries week following she sent me sweetmeats gloves etc this certainly would have appeared extremely gallant had i not been informed her marriage at same instant that journey i had thought proper give myself honor was only buy her wedding suit my indignation may easily be conceived i shall not attempt describe it this heroic fury i swore never more see perfidious girl supposing it greatest punishment that could be inflicted on her this however did not occasion her death for twenty years after while on visit my father being on lake i asked who those ladies were boat not far from ours what said my father smiling does not your heart inform you it is your former flame it is madame christin or if you please miss vulson i started at almost forgotten name instantly ordered waterman turn off not judging it worth while be perjured however favorable opportunity for revenge renewing dispute twenty years past with woman forty thus before my future destination was determined did i fool away most precious moments my youth after deliberating long time on bent my natural inclination they resolved dispose me manner most repugnant them i was sent mr masseron city register learn according expression my uncle bernard thriving occupation scraper this nickname was inconceivably displeasing me i promised myself but little satisfaction prospect heaping up money by mean employment assiduity subjection required completed my disgust i never set foot office without feeling kind horror which every day gained fresh strength mr masseron who was not better pleased with my abilities than i was with employment treated me with disdain incessantly upbraiding me with being fool blockhead not forgetting repeat that my uncle had assured him i was knowing one though he could not find that i knew anything that he had promised furnish him with sprightly boy but had truth sent him ass conclude i was turned out registry with additional ignominy being pronounced fool by all mr masseron s clerks fit only handle file my vocation thus determined i was bound apprentice not however watchmaker but engraver i had been so completely humiliated by contempt register that i submitted without murmur my master whose name was m ducommon was young man very violent boorish character who contrived short time tarnish all amiable qualities my childhood stupefy disposition naturally sprightly reduce my feelings as well as my condition absolute state servitude i forgot my latin history antiquities i could hardly recollect whether such people as romans ever existed when i visited my father he no longer beheld his idol nor could ladies recognize gallant jean jacques nay i was so well convinced that mr miss lambercier would scarce receive me as their pupil that i endeavored avoid their company from that time have never seen them vilest inclinations basest actions succeeded my amiable amusements even obliterated very remembrance them i must have had spite my good education great propensity degenerate else declension could not have followed with such ease rapidity for never did so promising caesar so quickly become laradon art itself did not displease me i had lively taste for drawing there was nothing displeasing exercise graver as it required no very extraordinary abilities attain perfection as watchcase engraver i hoped arrive at it perhaps i should have accomplished my design if unreasonable restraint added brutality my master had not rendered my business disgusting i wasted his time employed myself engraving medals which served me my companions as kind insignia for new invented order chivalry though this differed very little from my usual employ i considered it as relaxation unfortunately my master caught me at this contraband labor severe beating was consequence he reproached me at same time with attempting make counterfeit money because our medals bore arms republic though i can truly aver i had no conception false money very little true knowing better how make roman as than one our threepenny pieces my master s tyranny rendered insupportable that labor i should otherwise have loved drove me vices i naturally despised such as falsehood idleness theft nothing ever gave me clearer demonstration difference between filial dependence abject slavery than remembrance change produced me at that period hitherto i had enjoyed reasonable liberty this i had suddenly lost i was enterprising at my father s free at mr lambercier s discreet at my uncle s but with my master i became fearful from that moment my mind was vitiated accustomed live on terms perfect equality be witness no pleasures i could not command see no dish i was not partake or be sensible desire i might not express be able bring every wish my heart my lips what transition at my master s i was scarce allowed speak was forced quit table without tasting what i most longed for room when i had nothing particular do there was incessantly confined my work while liberty my master his journeymen enjoyed served only increase weight my subjection when disputes happened arise though conscious that i understood subject better than any them i dared not offer my opinion word everything i saw became object desire for no other reason than because i was not permitted enjoy anything farewell gayety ease those happy turns expressions which formerly even made my faults escape correction i recollect with pleasure circumstance that happened at my father s which even now makes me smile being for some fault ordered bed without my supper as i was passing through kitchen with my poor morsel bread my hand i saw meat turning on spit my father rest were round fire i must bow every one as i passed when i had gone through this ceremony leering with wistful eye at roast meat which looked so inviting smelt so savory i could not abstain from making that bow likewise adding pitiful tone good bye roast meal this unpremeditated pleasantry put them such good humor that i was permitted stay partake it perhaps same thing might have produced similar effect at my master s but such thought could never have occurred me or if it had i should not have had courage express it thus i learned covet dissemble lie at length steal propensity i never felt least idea before though since that time i have never been able entirely divest myself it desire inability united naturally led this vice which is reason pilfering is so common among footmen apprentices though latter as they grow up find themselves situation where everything is at their command lose this shameful propensity as i never experienced advantage i never enjoyed benefit good sentiments ill directed frequently lead children into vice notwithstanding my continual wants temptations it was more than year before i could resolve take even eatables my first theft was occasioned by complaisance but it was productive others which had not so plausible excuse my master had journeyman named verrat whose mother lived neighborhood had garden at considerable distance from house which produced excellent asparagus this verrat who had no great plenty money took it his head rob her most early production her garden by sale it procure those indulgences he could not otherwise afford himself but not being very nimble he did not care run hazard surprise after some preliminary flattery which i did not comprehend meaning he proposed this expedition me as idea which had that moment struck him at first i would not listen proposal but he persisted his solicitation as i could never resist attacks flattery at length prevailed pursuance this virtuous resolution i every morning repaired garden gathered best asparagus took it holard where some good old women who guessed how i came by it wishing diminish price made no secret their suspicions this produced desired effect for being alarmed i took whatever they offered which being taken mr verrat was presently metamorphosed into breakfast divided with companion his for though i procured it i never partook their good cheer being fully satisfied with inconsiderable bribe i executed my roguery with greatest fidelity seeking only please my employer several days passed before it came into my head rob robber tithe mr verrat s harvest i never considered hazard i run these expeditions not only torrent abuse but what i should have been still more sensible hearty beating for miscreant who received whole benefit would certainly have denied all knowledge fact i should only have received double portion punishment for daring accuse him since being only apprentice i stood no chance being believed opposition journeyman thus every situation powerful rogues know how save themselves at expense feeble this practice taught me it was not so terrible thieve as i had imagined i took care make this discovery turn some account helping myself everything within my reach that i conceived inclination for i was not absolutely ill fed at my master s temperance was only painful me by comparing it with luxury he enjoyed custom sending young people from table precisely when those things are served up which seem most tempting is calculated increase their longing induces them steal what they conceive be so delicious it may be supposed i was not backward this particular general my knavery succeeded pretty well though quite reverse when i happened be detected i recollect attempt procure some apples which was attended with circumstances that make me smile shudder even at this instant fruit was standing pantry which by lattice at considerable height received light from kitchen one day being alone house i climbed up see these precious apples which being out my reach made this pantry appear garden hesperides i fetched spit tried if it would reach them it was too short i lengthened it with small one which was used for game my master being very fond hunting darted at them several times without success at length was more fortunate being transported find i was bringing up apple i drew it gently lattice was going seize it when who can express my grief astonishment i found it would not pass through it was too large i tried every expedient accomplish my design sought supporters keep spits same position knife divide apple lath hold it with at length i so far succeeded as effect division made no doubt drawing pieces through but it was scarcely separated compassionate reader sympathize with my affliction when both pieces fell into pantry illustration 0028 though i lost time by this experiment i did not lose courage but dreading surprise i put off attempt till next day when i hoped be more successful returned my work as if nothing had happened without once thinking what two obvious witnesses i had left pantry deposed against me next day fine opportunity offering i renew trial i fasten spits together get on stool take aim am just going dart at my prey unfortunately dragon did not sleep pantry door opens my master makes his appearance looking up exclaims bravo horror that moment returns pen drops from my hand continual repetition ill treatment rendered me callous it seemed kind composition for my crimes which authorized me continue them instead looking back at punishment i looked forward revenge being beat like slave i judged i had right all vices one i was convinced that rob be punished were inseparable constituted if i may so express myself kind traffic which if i perform my part bargain my master would take care not be deficient his that preliminary settled i applied myself thieving with great tranquility whenever this interrogatory occurred my mind what will be consequence reply was ready i know worst i shall be beat no matter i was made for it i love good eating am sensual but not greedy i have such variety inclinations gratify that this can never predominate unless my heart is unoccupied which very rarely happens i pay but little attention my appetite purloining eatables but extended this propensity everything i wished possess if i did not become robber form it was only because money never tempted me my master had closet workshop which he kept locked this i contrived open shut as often as i pleased laid his best tools fine drawings impressions word everything he wished keep from me under contribution these thefts were so far innocent that they were always employed his service but i was transported at having trifles my possession imagined i stole art with its productions besides what i have mentioned his boxes contained threads gold silver number small jewels valuable medals money yet though i seldom had five sous my pocket i do not recollect ever having cast wishful look at them on contrary i beheld these valuables rather with terror than with delight i am convinced dread taking money was great measure effect education there was mingled with idea it fear infamy prison punishment death had i even felt temptation these objects would have made me tremble whereas my failings appeared species waggery truth they were little else they could but occasion good trimming this i was already prepared for sheet fine drawing paper was greater temptation than money sufficient have purchased ream this unreasonable caprice is connected with one most striking singularities my character has so far influenced my conduct that it requires particular explanation my passions are extremely violent while under their influence nothing can equal my impetuosity i am absolute stranger discretion respect fear or decorum rude saucy violent intrepid no shame can stop no danger intimidate me my mind is frequently so engrossed by single object that beyond it whole world is not worth thought this is enthusiasm moment next perhaps i am plunged state annihilation take me my moments tranquility i am indolence timidity itself word speak least trifle perform appear intolerable labor everything alarms terrifies me very buzzing fly will make me shudder i am so subdued by fear shame that i would gladly shield myself from mortal view when obliged exert myself i am ignorant what do when forced speak i am at loss for words if any one looks at me i am instantly out countenance if animated with my subject i express my thoughts with ease but ordinary conversations i can say nothing absolutely nothing being obliged speak renders them insupportable i may add that none my predominant inclinations centre those pleasures which are be purchased money empoisons my delight i must have them unadulterated i love those table for instance but cannot endure restraints good company or intemperance taverns i can enjoy them only with friend for alone it is equally impossible my imagination is then so occupied with other things that i find no pleasure eating women who are be purchased have no charms for me my beating heart cannot be satisfied without affection it is same with every other enjoyment if not truly disinterested they are absolutely insipid word i am fond those things which are only estimable minds formed for peculiar enjoyment them i never thought money so desirable as it is usually imagined if you would enjoy you must transform it this transformation is frequently attended with inconvenience you must bargain purchase pay dear be badly served often duped i buy egg am assured it is new laid i find it stale fruit its utmost perfection tis absolutely green i love good wine but where shall i get it not at my wine merchant s he will poison me certainty i wish be universally respected how shall i compass my design i must make friends send messages write letters come go wait be frequently deceived money is perpetual source uneasiness i fear it more than i love good wine thousand times both during since my apprenticeship have i gone out purchase some nicety i approach pastry cook s perceive some women at counter imagine they are laughing at me i pass fruit shop see some fine pears their appearance tempts me but then two or three young people are near or man i am acquainted with is standing at door i take all that pass for persons i have some knowledge my near sight contributes deceive me i am everywhere intimidated restrained by some obstacle with money my pocket return as i went for want resolution purchase what i long for i should enter into most insipid details was i relate trouble shame repugnance inconvenience all kinds which i have experienced parting with my money whether my own person or by agency others as i proceed reader will get acquainted with my disposition perceive all this without my troubling him with recital this once comprehended one my apparent contradictions will be easily accounted for most sordid avarice reconciled with greatest contempt money it is movable which i consider so little value that when destitute it i never wish acquire any when i have sum i keep it by me for want knowing how dispose it my satisfaction but let agreeable convenient opportunity present itself i empty my purse with utmost freedom not that i would have reader imagine i am extravagant from motive ostentation quite reverse it was ever subservience my pleasures instead glorying expense i endeavor conceal it i so well perceive that money is not made answer my purposes that i am almost ashamed have any still more make use it had i ever possessed moderate independence i am convinced i should have had no propensity become avaricious i should have required no more cheerfully lived up my income but my precarious situation has constantly necessarily kept me fear i love liberty i loathe constraint dependence all their kindred annoyances as long as my purse contains money it secures my independence exempts me from trouble seeking other money trouble which i have always had perfect horror dread seeing end my independence makes me proportionately unwilling part with my money money that we possess is instrument liberty that which we lack strive obtain is instrument slavery thence it is that i hold fast aught that i have yet covet nothing more my disinterestedness then is reality only idleness pleasure possessing is not my estimation worth trouble acquiring my dissipation is only another form idleness when we have opportunity disbursing pleasantly we should make best possible use it i am less tempted by money than by other objects because between moment possessing money that using it obtain desired object there is always interval however short whereas possess thing is enjoy it i see thing it tempts me but if i see not thing itself but only means acquiring it i am not tempted therefore it is that i have been pilferer am so even now way mere trifles which i take fancy which i find it easier take than ask for but i never my life recollect having taken farthing from any one except about fifteen years ago when i stole seven francs ten sous story is worth recounting as it exhibits concurrence ignorance stupidity i should scarcely credit did it relate any but myself it was paris i was walking with m de franceul at palais royal he pulled out his watch he looked at it said me suppose we go opera with all my heart we go he takes two box tickets gives me one enters himself with other i follow find door crowded looking see every one standing judging therefore that m de franceul might suppose me concealed by company i go out ask for my ticket getting money returned leave house without considering that by then i had reached door every one would be seated m de franceul might readily perceive i was not there as nothing could be more opposite my natural inclination than this abominable meanness i note it show there are moments delirium when men ought not be judged by their actions this was not stealing money it was only stealing use it was more infamous for wanting excuse temptation i should never end these accounts was i describe all gradations through which i passed during my apprenticeship from sublimity hero baseness villain though i entered into most vices my situation i had no relish for its pleasures amusements my companions were displeasing when too much restraint had made my business wearisome i had nothing amuse me this renewed my taste for reading which had long been neglected i thus committed fresh offence books made me neglect my work brought on additional punishment while inclination strengthened by constraint became unconquerable passion la tribu well known librarian furnished me with all kinds good or bad i perused them with avidity without discrimination it will be said at length then money became necessary true but this happened at time when taste for study had deprived me both resolution activity totally occupied by this new inclination i only wished read i robbed no longer this is another my peculiarities mere nothing frequently calls me off from what i appear most attached i give new idea it becomes passion immediately every former desire is forgotten reading was my new hobby my heart beat with impatience run over new book i carried my pocket first moment i was alone i seized opportunity draw it out thought no longer rummaging my master s closet i was even ashamed think that i had been guilty such meanness had my amusements been more expensive i no longer felt inclination continue it la tribu gave me credit when once i had book my possession i thought no more trifle i was pay for it as money came it naturally passed this woman when she chanced be pressing nothing was so conveniently at hand as my own effects steal advance required foresight robbing pay was no temptation frequent blows i received from my master with my private ill chosen studies rendered me reserved unsociable almost deranged my reason though my taste had not preserved me from silly unmeaning books by good fortune i was stranger licentious or obscene ones not that la tribu who was very accommodating had any scruple lending these on contrary enhance their worth she spoke them with air mystery this produced effect she had not foreseen for both shame disgust made me constantly refuse them chance so well seconded my bashful disposition that i was past age thirty before i saw any those dangerous compositions less than year i had exhausted la tribu s scanty library was unhappy for want further amusement my reading though frequently bad had worn off my childish follies brought back my heart nobler sentiments than my condition had inspired meantime disgusted with all within my reach thinking everything charming that was out it my present situation appeared extremely miserable my passions began acquire strength i felt their influence without knowing whither they would conduct me i sometimes indeed thought my former follies but sought no further at this time my imagination took turn which helped calm my increasing emotions it was contemplate those situations books i had read which produced most striking effect on my mind recall combine apply them myself such manner as become one personages my recollection presented be continually those fancied circumstances which were most agreeable my inclinations word by contriving place myself these fictitious situations idea my real one was great measure obliterated this fondness for imaginary objects facility with which i could gain possession them completed my disgust for everything around me fixed that inclination for solitude which has ever since been predominant we shall have more than once occasion remark effects disposition misanthropic melancholy appearance but which proceed fact from heart too affectionate too ardent which for want similar dispositions is constrained content itself with nonentities be satisfied with fiction it is sufficient at present have traced origin propensity which has modified my passions set bounds each by giving too much ardor my wishes has ever rendered me too indolent obtain them thus i attained my sixteenth year uneasy discontented with myself everything that surrounded me displeased with my occupation without enjoying pleasures common my age weeping without cause sighing i knew not why fond my chimerical ideas for want more valuable realities every sunday after sermon time my companions came fetch me out wishing me partake their diversions i would willingly have been excused but when once engaged amusement i was more animated enterprising than any them it was equally difficult engage or restrain me indeed this was ever leading trait my character our country walks i was ever foremost never thought returning till reminded by some my companions i was twice obliged be from my master s whole night city gates having been shut before i could reach them reader may imagine what treatment this procured me following mornings but i was promised such reception for third that i made firm resolution never expose myself danger it notwithstanding my determination i repeated this dreaded transgression my vigilance having been rendered useless by cursed captain named m minutoli who when on guard always shut gate he had charge hour before usual time i was returning home with my two companions had got within half league city when i heard them beat tattoo i redouble my pace i run with my utmost speed i approach bridge see soldiers already at their posts i call out them suffocated voice it is too late i am twenty paces from guard first bridge is already drawn up i tremble see those terrible horns advanced air which announce fatal inevitable destiny which from this moment began pursue me i threw myself on glacis transport despair while my companions who only laughed at accident immediately determined what do my resolution though different from theirs was equally sudden on spot i swore never return my master s next morning when my companions entered city i bade them eternal adieu conjuring them at same time inform my cousin bernard my resolution place where he might see me for last time from commencement my apprenticeship i had seldom seen him at first indeed we saw each other on sundays but each acquiring different habits our meetings were less frequent i am persuaded his mother contributed greatly towards this change he was consider himself as person consequence i was pitiful apprentice notwithstanding our relationship equality no longer subsisted between us it was degrading himself frequent my company as he had natural good heart his mother s lessons did not take immediate effect for some time he continued visit me having learned my resolution he hastened spot i had appointed not however dissuade me from it but render my flight agreeable by some trifling presents as my own resources would not have carried me far he gave me among other things small sword which i was very proud took with me as far as turin where absolute want constrained me dispose it more i reflect on his behavior at this critical moment more i am persuaded he followed instructions his mother perhaps his father likewise for had he been left his own feelings he would have endeavored retain or have been tempted accompany me on contrary he encouraged design when he saw me resolutely determined pursue it without seeming much affected left me my fate we never saw or wrote each other from that time i cannot but regret this loss for his heart was essentially good we seemed formed for more lasting friendship before i abandon myself fatality my destiny let me contemplate for moment prospect that awaited me had i fallen into hands better master nothing could have been more agreeable my disposition or more likely confer happiness than peaceful condition good artificer so respectable line as engravers are considered at geneva i could have obtained easy subsistence if not fortune this would have bounded my ambition i should have had means indulge moderate pleasures should have continued my natural sphere without meeting with any temptation go beyond it having imagination sufficiently fertile embellish with its chimeras every situation powerful enough transport me from one another it was immaterial which i was fixed that was best adapted me which requiring least care or exertion left mind most at liberty this happiness i should have enjoyed my native country bosom my religion family friends i should have passed calm peaceful life uniformity pleasing occupation among connections dear my heart i should have been good christian good citizen good friend good man i should have relished my condition perhaps have been honor it after having passed life happy obscurity surrounded by my family i should have died at peace soon it may be forgotten but while remembered it would have been with tenderness regret instead this what picture am i about draw alas why should i anticipate miseries i have endured reader will have but too much melancholy subject book ii moment which fear had instigated my flight did not seem more terrible than that wherein i put my design execution appeared delightful leave my relations my resources while yet child midst my apprenticeship before i had learned enough my business obtain subsistence run on inevitable misery danger expose myself that age weakness innocence all temptations vice despair set out search errors misfortunes snares slavery death endure more intolerable evils than those i meant shun was picture i should have drawn natural consequence my hazardous enterprise how different was idea i entertained it independence i seemed possess was sole object my contemplation having obtained my liberty i thought everything attainable i entered with confidence on vast theatre world which my merit was captivate at every step i expected find amusements treasures adventures friends ready

have satisfied me my moderation was such that sphere which i proposed shine was rather circumscribed but then it was possess very quintessence enjoyment myself principal object single castle for instance might have bounded my ambition could i have been favorite lord lady daughter s lover son s friend protector neighbors i might have been tolerably content sought no further expectation this modest fortune i passed few days environs city with some country people my acquaintance who received me with more kindness than i should have met with town they welcomed lodged fed me cheerfully i could be said live on charity these favors were not conferred with sufficient appearance superiority furnish out idea i rambled about this manner till i got confignon savoy at about two leagues distance from geneva vicar was called m de pontverre this name so famous history republic caught my attention i was curious see what appearance descendants gentlemen spoon exhibited i went therefore visit this m de pontverre was received with great civility he spoke heresy geneva declaimed on authority holy mother church then invited me dinner i had little object arguments which had so desirable conclusion was inclined believe that priests who gave such excellent dinners might be as good as our ministers notwithstanding m de pontverre s pedigree i certainly possessed most learning but i rather sought be good companion than expert theologian his frangi wine which i thought delicious argued so powerfully on his side that i should have blushed at silencing so kind host i therefore yielded him victory or rather declined contest any one who had observed my precaution would certainly have pronounced me dissembler though fact i was only courteous flattery or rather condescension is not always vice young people tis oftener virtue when treated with kindness it is natural feel attachment for person who confers obligation we do not acquiesce because we wish deceive but from dread giving uneasiness or because we wish avoid ingratitude rendering evil for good what interest had m de pontverre entertaining treating with respect endeavoring convince me none but mine my young heart told me this i was penetrated with gratitude respect for generous priest i was sensible my superiority but scorned repay his hospitality by taking advantage it i had no conception hypocrisy this forbearance or thought changing my religion nay so far was idea from being familiar me that i looked on it with degree horror which seemed exclude possibility such event i only wished avoid giving offence those i was sensible caressed me from that motive i wished cultivate their good opinion meantime leave them hope success by seeming less on my guard than i really was my conduct this particular resembled coquetry some very honest women who obtain their wishes without permitting or promising anything sometimes encourage hopes they never mean realize reason piety love order certainly demanded that instead being encouraged my folly i should have been dissuaded from ruin i was courting sent back my family this conduct any one that was actuated by genuine virtue would have pursued but it should be observed that though m de pontverre was religious man he was not virtuous one but bigot who knew no virtue except worshipping images telling his beads word kind missionary who thought height merit consisted writing libels against ministers geneva far from wishing send me back he endeavored favor my escape put it out my power return even had i been so disposed it was thousand one but he was sending me perish with hunger or become villain but all this was foreign his purpose he saw soul snatched from heresy restored bosom church whether i was honest man or knave was very immaterial provided i went mass this ridiculous mode thinking is not peculiar catholics it is voice every dogmatical persuasion where merit consists belief not virtue you are called by almighty said m de pontverre go annecy where you will find good charitable lady whom bounty king enables turn souls from those errors she has happily renounced he spoke madam de warens new convert whom priests contrived send those wretches who were disposed sell their faith with these she was manner constrained share pension two thousand francs bestowed on her by king sardinia i felt myself extremely humiliated at being supposed want assistance good charitable lady i had no objection be accommodated with everything i stood need but did not wish receive it on footing charity owe this obligation devotee was still worse notwithstanding my scruples persuasions m de pontverre dread perishing with hunger pleasures i promised myself from journey hope obtaining some desirable situation determined me i set out though reluctantly for annecy i could easily have reached it day but being no great haste arrive there it took me three my head was filled with ideas adventures i approached every country seat i saw my way expectation having them realized i had too much timidity knock at doors or even enter if i saw them open but i did what i dared which was sing under those windows that i thought had most favorable appearance was very much disconcerted find i wasted my breath no purpose that neither old nor young ladies were attracted by melody my voice or wit my poetry though some songs my companions had taught me i thought excellent that i sung them incomparably at length i arrived at annecy saw madam de warens as this period my life great measure determined my character i could not resolve pass it lightly over i was middle my sixteenth year though i could not be called handsome was well made for my height i had good foot well turned leg animated countenance well

mind had received some cultivation having seen nothing world i was absolute stranger polite address my mental acquisitions so far from supplying this defect only served increase my embarrassment by making me sensible every deficiency depending little therefore on external appearances i had recourse other expedients i wrote most elaborate letter where mingling all flowers rhetoric which i had borrowed from books with phrases apprentice i endeavored strike attention insure good will madam de warens i enclosed m de pontverre s letter my own waited on lady with heart palpitating with fear

convent visitation i came annecy just six years after this event madam de warens was then eight twenty being born with century her beauty consisting more expressive animation countenance than set features was its meridian her manner soothing tender angelic smile played about her mouth which was small delicate she wore her hair which was ash color uncommonly beautiful with air negligence that made her appear still more interesting she was short rather thick for her height though by no means disagreeably so but there could not be more lovely face finer neck or hands arms more exquisitely formed her education had been derived from such variety sources that it formed extraordinary assemblage like me she had lost her mother at her birth had received instruction as it chanced present itself she had learned something her governess something her father little her masters but copiously from her lovers particularly m de tavel who possessing both taste information endeavored adorn with them mind her he loved these various instructions not being properly arranged tended impede each other she did not acquire that degree improvement her natural good sense was capable receiving she knew

carried its utmost extent means she employed being proportioned rather her ideas than abilities she failed by mismanagement those upon whom she depended was ruined where another would scarce have been loser this active disposition which involved her so many difficulties was at least productive one benefit as it prevented her from passing remainder her life monastic asylum she had chosen which she had some thought simple uniform life nun little cabals gossipings their parlor were not adapted mind vigorous active which every day forming new systems had occasions for liberty attempt their completion good bishop bernex with less wit than francis sales resembled him many particulars madam de warens whom he loved call his daughter who was like madam de chantel several respects might have increased resemblance by retiring like her from world had she not been disgusted with idle trifling convent it was not want zeal prevented this amiable woman from giving those proofs devotion which might have been expected from new convert under immediate direction prelate whatever might have influenced her change her religion she was certainly sincere that she had embraced she might find sufficient occasion repent having abjured her former faith but no inclination return it she not only died good catholic but truly lived one nay i dare affirm i think i have had opportunity read secrets her heart that it was only her aversion singularity that prevented her acting devotee public word her piety was too sincere give way any affectation it but this is not place enlarge on her principles i shall find other occasions speak them let those who deny existence sympathy souls explain if they know how why first glance first word madam de warens inspired me not only with lively attachment but with most unbounded confidence which has since known no abatement say this was love which will at least appear doubtful those who read sequel our attachment how could this passion be attended with sentiments which scarce ever accompany its commencement such as peace serenity security confidence how when making application amiable polished woman whose situation life was so superior mine so far above any i had yet approached on whom great measure depended my future fortune by degree interest she might take it how i say with so many reasons depress me did i feel myself as free as much at my ease as if i had been perfectly secure pleasing her why did i not experience moment embarrassment timidity or restraint naturally bashful easily confused having seen nothing world could i first time first moment i beheld her adopt caressing language familiar tone as readily as after ten years intimacy had rendered these freedoms natural is it possible possess love i will not say without desires for i certainly had them but without inquietude without jealousy can we avoid feeling anxious wish at least know whether our affection is returned yet such question never entered my imagination i should as soon have inquired do i love myself nor did she ever express greater degree curiosity there was certainly something extraordinary my attachment this charming woman it will be found sequel that some extravagances which cannot be foreseen attended it what could be done for me was present question order discuss point with greater freedom she made me dine with her this was first meal my life where i had experienced want appetite her woman who waited observed it was first time she had seen traveller my age appearance deficient that particular this remark which did me no injury opinion her mistress fell hard on overgrown clown who was my fellow guest devoured sufficient have served at least six moderate feeders for me i was too much charmed think eating my heart began imbibe delicious sensation which engrossed my whole being left no room for other objects madam de warens wished hear particulars my little history all vivacity i had lost during my servitude returned assisted recital proportion interest this excellent woman took my story did she lament fate which i had exposed myself compassion was painted on her features expressed by every action she could not exhort me return geneva being too well aware that her words actions were strictly scrutinized that such advice would be thought high treason against catholicism but she spoke so feelingly affliction i must give my father that it was easy perceive she would have approved my returning console him alas she little thought how powerfully this pleaded against herself more eloquently persuasive she appeared less could i resolve tear myself from her i knew that returning geneva would be putting insuperable barrier between us unless i repeated expedient which had brought me here it was certainly better preserve than expose myself danger relapse besides all this my conduct was predetermined i was resolved not return madam de warens seeing her endeavors would be fruitless became less explicit only added with air commiseration poor child thou must go where providence directs thee but one day thou wilt think me i believe she had no conception at that time how fatally her prediction would be verified difficulty still remained how i was gain subsistence i have already observed that i knew too little engraving for that furnish my resource had i been more expert savoy was too poor country give much encouragement arts above mentioned glutton who ate for us as well as himself being obliged pause order gain some relaxation from fatigue it imparted piece advice which according him came express from heaven though judge by its effects it appeared have been dictated from direct contrary quarter this was that i should go turin where hospital instituted for instruction catechumens i should find food both spiritual temporal be reconciled bosom church meet with some charitable christians who would make it point procure me situation that would turn my advantage regard expenses journey continued our advisor his grace my lord bishop will not be backward when once madam has proposed this holy work offer his charitable donation madam baroness whose charity is so well known once more addressing himself continuation his meal will certainly contribute i was by no means pleased with all these charities i said nothing but my heart was ready burst with vexation madam de warens who did not seem think so highly this expedient as projector pretended do contented herself by saying everyone should endeavor promote good actions that she would mention it his lordship but meddling devil who had some private interest this affair questioned whether she would urge it his satisfaction took care acquaint almoners with my story so far influenced those good priests that when madam de warens who disliked journey on my account mentioned it bishop she found it so far concluded on that he immediately put into her hands money designed for my little viaticum she dared not advance anything against it i was approaching age when woman like her could not with any propriety appear anxious retain me my departure being thus determined by those who undertook management my concerns i had only submit i did it without much repugnance though turin was at greater distance from madam de warens than geneva yet being capital country i was now it seemed have more connection with annecy than city under different government contrary religion besides as i undertook this journey obedience her i considered myself as living under her direction which was more flattering than barely continue neighborhood sum up all idea long journey coincided with my insurmountable passion for rambling which already began demonstrate itself pass mountains my eye appeared delightful how charming reflection elevating myself above my companions by whole height alps see world is almost irresistible temptation genevan accordingly i gave my consent he who suggested journey was set off two days with his wife i was recommended their care they were likewise made my purse bearers which had been augmented by madam de warens who not contented with these kindnesses added secretly pecuniary reinforcement attended with most ample instructions we departed on wednesday before easter day following my father arrived at annecy accompanied by his friend mr rival who was likewise watchmaker he was man sense letters who wrote better verses than la motte spoke almost as well what is still more his praise he was man strictest integrity but whose taste for literature only served make one his sons comedian having traced me house madam de warens they contented themselves with lamenting like her my fate instead overtaking me which as they were on horseback i on foot they might have accomplished with greatest ease my uncle bernard did same thing he arrived at consignon received information that i was gone annecy immediately returned back geneva thus my nearest relations seemed have conspired with my adverse stars consign me misery ruin by similar negligence my brother was so entirely lost that it was never known what was become him my father was not only man honor but strictest probity endured with that magnanimity which frequently produces most shining virtues i may add he was good father particularly me whom he tenderly loved but he likewise loved his pleasures since we had been separated other connections had weakened his paternal affections he had married again at nion though his second wife was too old expect children she had relations my father was united another family surrounded by other objects variety cares prevented my returning his remembrance he was decline life had nothing support inconveniences old age my mother s property devolved me my brother but during our absence interest it was enjoyed by my father i do not mean infer that this consideration had immediate effect on his conduct but it had imperceptible one prevented him making use that exertion regain me which he would otherwise have employed this i think was reason that having traced me as far as annecy he stopped short without proceeding chambery where he was almost certain i should be found likewise accounts why on visiting him several times since my flight he always received me with great kindness but never made any efforts retain me this conduct father whose affection virtue i was so well convinced has given birth reflections on regulation my own conduct which have greatly contributed preserve integrity my heart it has taught me this great lesson morality perhaps only one that can have any conspicuous influence on our actions that we should ever carefully avoid putting our interests competition with our duty or promise ourselves felicity from misfortunes others certain that such circumstances however sincere our love virtue may be sooner or later it will give way we shall imperceptibly become unjust wicked fact however upright our intentions this maxim strongly imprinted on my mind reduced though rather too late practice has given my conduct appearance folly whimsicality not only public but still more among my acquaintances it has been said i affected originality sought act different from other people truth is i neither endeavor conform or be singular i desire only act virtuously avoid situations which by setting my interest opposition that another person s might inspire me with secret though involuntary wish his disadvantage two years ago my lord marshal would have put my name his will which i took every method prevent assuring him i would not for world know myself will any one much less his he gave up idea but insisted return that i should accept annuity on his life this i consented it will be said i find my account alteration perhaps i may but oh my benefactor my father i am now sensible that should i have misfortune survive thee i should have everything lose nothing gain this my idea true philosophy surest bulwark human rectitude every day do i receive fresh conviction its profound solidity i have endeavored recommend it all my latter writings but multitude read too superficially have made remark if i survive my present undertaking am able begin another i mean continuation emilius give such lively marking example this maxim as cannot fail strike attention but i have made reflections enough for traveller it is time continue my journey it turned out more agreeable than i expected my clownish conductor was not so morose as he appeared be he was middle aged man wore his black grizzly hair queue had martial air strong voice was tolerably cheerful make up for not having been taught any trade could turn his hand every one having proposed establish some kind manufactory at annecy he had consulted madam de warens who immediately gave into project he was now going turin lay plan before minister get his approbation for which journey he took care be well rewarded this drole had art ingratiating himself with priests whom he ever appeared eager serve he adopted certain jargon which he had learned by frequenting their company thought himself notable preacher he could even repeat one passage from bible latin it answered his purpose as well as if he had known thousand for he repeated it thousand times day he was seldom at loss for money when he knew what purse contained it yet was rather artful than knavish when dealing out affected tone his unmeaning discourses resembled peter hermit preaching up crusade with sabre at his side madam sabran his wife was tolerable good sort woman more peaceable by day than by night as i slept same chamber i was frequently disturbed by her wakefulness should have been more so had i comprehended cause it but i was chapter dullness which left nature whole care my own instruction i went on gayly with my pious guide his hopeful companion no sinister accident impeding our journey i was happiest circumstances both mind body that i ever recollect having experienced young full health security placing unbounded confidence myself others that short but charming moment human life whose expansive energy carries if i may so express myself our being utmost extent our sensations embellishing all nature with inexpressible charm flowing from conscious rising enjoyment our existence my pleasing inquietudes became less wandering i had now object on which imagination could fix i looked on myself as work pupil friend almost lover madam de warens obliging things she had said caresses she had bestowed on me tender interest she seemed take everything that concerned me those charming looks which seemed replete with love because they so powerfully inspired it every consideration flattered my ideas during this journey furnished most delicious reveries which no doubt no fear my future condition arose embitter sending me turin i thought they engaged find me agreeable subsistence there thus eased every care i passed lightly on while young desires enchanting hopes brilliant prospects employed my mind each object that presented itself seemed insure my approaching felicity i imagined that every house was filled with joyous festivity meadows resounded with sports revelry rivers offered refreshing baths delicious fish wantoned these streams how delightful was it ramble along flowery banks trees were loaded with choicest fruits while their shade afforded most charming voluptuous retreats happy lovers mountains abounded with milk cream peace leisure simplicity joy mingled with charm going i knew not whither everything i saw carried my heart some new cause for rapture grandeur variety real beauty scene some measure rendered charm reasonable which vanity came for its share go so young italy view such extent country pursue route hannibal over alps appeared glory beyond my age add all this our frequent agreeable halts with good appetite plenty satisfy it for truth it was not worth while be sparing at mr sabran s table what i eat could scarce be missed whole course my life i cannot recollect interval more perfectly exempt from care than seven or eight days i was passing from annecy turin as we were obliged walk madam sabran s pace it rather appeared agreeable jaunt than fatiguing journey there still remains most pleasing impressions it on my mind idea pedestrian excursion particularly among mountains has from this time seemed delightful it was only my happiest days that i travelled on foot ever with most unbounded satisfaction afterwards occupied with business encumbered with baggage i was forced act gentleman employ carriage where care embarrassment restraint were sure be my companions instead being delighted with journey i only wished arrive at place destination i was long time at paris wishing meet with two companions similar dispositions who would each agree appropriate fifty guineas his property year his time making tour italy on foot with no other attendance than young fellow carry our necessaries i have met with many who seemed enchanted with project but considered it only as visionary scheme which served well enough talk without any design putting it execution one day speaking with enthusiasm this project diderot grimm they gave into proposal with such warmth that i thought matter concluded on but it only turned out journey on paper which grimm thought nothing so pleasing as making diderot commit number impieties shutting me up inquisition for them instead him my regret at arriving so soon at turin was compensated by pleasure viewing large city hope figuring there conspicuous character for my brain already began be intoxicated with fumes ambition my present situation appeared infinitely above that apprentice i was far from foreseeing how soon i should be much below it before i proceed i ought offer excuse or justification reader for great number unentertaining particulars i am necessitated repeat pursuance resolution i have formed enter on this public exhibition myself it is necessary that nothing should bear appearance obscurity or concealment i should be continually under eye reader he should be enabled follow me all wanderings my heart through every intricacy my adventures he must find no void or chasm my relation nor lose sight me instant lest he should find occasion say what was he doing at this time suspect me not having dared reveal whole i give sufficient scope malignity what i say it is unnecessary i should furnish still more by my silence my money was all gone even that i had secretly received from madam de warens i had been so indiscreet as divulge this secret my conductors had taken care profit by it madam sabran found means deprive me everything i had even ribbon embroidered with silver with which madam de warens had adorned hilt my sword this i regretted more than all rest indeed sword itself would have gone same way had i been less obstinately bent on retaining it they had it is true supported me during journey but left me nothing at end it i arrived at turin without money clothes or linen being precisely situation owe my merit alone whole honor that fortune i was about acquire i took care first place deliver letters i was charged with was presently conducted hospital catechumens be instructed that religion for which return i was receive subsistence on entering i passed iron barred gate which was immediately double locked on me this beginning was by no means calculated give me favorable opinion my situation i was then conducted large apartment whose furniture consisted wooden altar at farther end on which was large crucifix round it several indifferent chairs same materials this hall audience were assembled four or five ill looking banditti my comrades instruction who would rather have been taken for trusty servants devil than candidates for kingdom heaven two these fellows were sclavonians but gave out they were african jews as they assured me had run through spain italy embracing christian faith being baptised wherever they thought it worth their labor soon after they opened another iron gate which divided large balcony that overlooked court yard by this avenue entered our sister catechumens who like me were going be regenerated not by baptism but solemn abjuration viler set idle dirty abandoned harlots never disgraced any persuasion one among them however appeared pretty interesting she might be about my own age perhaps year or two older had pair roguish eyes which frequently encountered mine this was enough inspire me with desire becoming acquainted with her but she had been so strongly recommended care old governess this respectable sisterhood was so narrowly watched by pious missionary who labored for her conversion with more zeal than diligence that during two months we remained together this house where she had already been three i found it absolutely impossible exchange word with her she must have been extremely stupid though she had not appearance it for never was longer course instruction holy man could never bring her state mind fit for abjuration meantime she became weary her cloister declaring that christian or not she would stay there no longer they were obliged take her at her word lest she should grow refractory insist on departing as great sinner as she came this hopeful community were assembled honor new comer when our guides made us short exhortation i was conjured be obedient grace that heaven had bestowed on me rest were admonished assist me with their prayers give me edification by their good example our virgins then retired another apartment i was left contemplate at leisure that wherein i found myself next morning we were again assembled for instruction i now began reflect for first time on step i was about take circumstances which had led me it i repeat shall perhaps repeat again assertion i have already advanced whose truth i every day receive fresh conviction which is that if ever child received reasonable virtuous education it was myself born family unexceptionable morals every lesson i received was replete with maxims prudence virtue my father though fond gallantry not only possessed distinguished probity but much religion world he appeared man pleasure his family he was christian implanted early my mind those sentiments he felt force my three aunts were women virtue piety two eldest were professed devotees third who united all graces wit good sense was perhaps more truly religious than either though with less ostentation from bosom this amiable family i was transplanted m lambercier s man dedicated ministry who believed doctrine he taught acted up its precepts he his sister matured by their instructions those principles judicious piety i had already imbibed means employed by these worthy people were so well adapted effect they meant produce that so far from being fatigued i scarce ever listened their admonitions without finding myself sensibly affected forming resolutions live virtuously from which except moments forgetfulness i seldom swerved at my uncle s religion was far more tiresome because they made it employment with my master i thought no more it though my sentiments continued same i had no companions vitiate my morals i became idle careless obstinate but my principles were not impaired i possessed as much religion therefore as child could be supposed capable acquiring why should i now disguise my thoughts i am persuaded i had more my childhood i was not child i felt i thought as man as i advanced years i mingled with ordinary class my infancy i was distinguished from it i shall doubtless incur ridicule by thus modestly holding myself up for prodigy i am content let those who find themselves disposed it laugh their fill afterward let them find child that at six years old is delighted interested affected with romances even shedding floods tears i shall then feel my ridiculous vanity acknowledge myself error thus when i said we should not converse with children on religion if we wished them ever possess any when i asserted they were incapable communion with supreme being even our confined degree i drew my conclusions from general observation i knew they were not applicable particular instances find j j rousseau six years old converse with them on religious subjects at seven i will be answerable that experiment will be attended with no danger it is understood i believe that child or even man is likely be most sincere while persevering that religion whose belief he was born educated we frequently detract from seldom make any additions it dogmatical faith is effect education addition this general principle which attached me religion my forefathers i had that particular aversion our city entertains for catholicism which is represented there as most monstrous idolatry whose clergy are painted blackest colors this sentiment was so firmly imprinted on my mind that i never dared look into their churches i could not bear meet priest his surplice never did i hear bells procession sound without shuddering with horror these sensations soon wore off great cities but frequently returned country parishes which bore more similarity spot where i first experienced them meantime this dislike was singularly contrasted by remembrance those caresses which priests neighborhood geneva are fond bestowing on children that city if bells viaticum alarmed me chiming for mass or vespers called me breakfast collation pleasure regaling on fresh butter fruits or milk good cheer m de pontverre had produced considerable effect on me my former abhorrence began diminish looking on popery through medium amusement good living i easily reconciled myself idea enduring though i never entertained but very transient distant idea making solemn profession it at this moment such transaction appeared all its horrors i shuddered at engagement i had entered into its inevitable consequences future neophytes with which i was surrounded were not calculated sustain my courage by their example i could not help considering holy work i was about perform as action villain though young i was sufficiently convinced that whatever religion might be true one i was about sell mine even should i chance chose best i lied holy ghost merited disdain every good man more i considered more i despised myself trembled at fate which had led me into such predicament as if my present situation had not been my own seeking there were moments when these compunctions were so strong that had i found door open but for instant i should certainly have made my escape but this was impossible nor was resolution any long duration being combated by too many secret motives stand any chance gaining victory my fixed determination not return geneva shame that would attend it difficulty repassing mountains at distance from my country without friends without resources everything concurred make me consider my remorse conscience as too late repentance i affected reproach myself for what i had done seek excuses for that i intended do by aggravating errors past looked on future as inevitable consequence i did not say nothing is yet done you may be innocent if you please but i said tremble at crime thou hast committed which hath reduced thee necessity filling up measure thine iniquities it required more resolution than was natural my age revoke those expectations which i had given them reason entertain break those chains with which i was enthralled resolutely declare i would continue religion my forefathers whatever might be consequence affair was already too far advanced spite all my efforts they would have made point bringing it conclusion sophism which ruined me has had similar affect on greater part mankind who lament want resolution when opportunity for exercising it is over practice virtue is only difficult from our own negligence were we always discreet we should seldom have occasion for any painful exertion it we are captivated by desires we might readily surmount give into temptations that might easily be resisted insensibly get into embarrassing perilous situations from which we cannot extricate ourselves but with utmost difficulty intimidated by effort we fall into abyss saying almighty why hast thou made us such weak creatures but notwithstanding our vain pretexts he replies by our consciences i formed ye too weak get out gulf because i gave ye sufficient strength not have fallen into it i was not absolutely resolved become catholic but as it was not necessary declare my intentions immediately i gradually accustomed myself idea hoping meantime that some unforeseen event would extricate me from my embarrassment order gain time i resolved make best defence i possibly could favor my own opinion but my vanity soon rendered this resolution unnecessary for on finding i frequently embarrassed those who had care my instruction i wished heighten my triumph by giving them complete overthrow i zealously pursued my plan not without ridiculous hope being able convert my convertors for i was simple enough believe that could i convince them their errors they would become protestants they did not find therefore that facility work which they had expected as i differed both regard will knowledge from opinion they had entertained me protestants general are better instructed principles their religion than catholics reason is obvious doctrine former requires discussion latter blind submission catholic must content himself with decisions others protestant must learn decide for himself they were not ignorant this but neither my age nor appearance promised much difficulty men so accustomed disputation they knew likewise that i had not received my first communion nor instructions which accompany it but on other hand they had no idea information i received at m lambercier s or that i had learned history church empire almost by heart at my father s though since that time nearly forgot when warmed by dispute very unfortunately for these gentlemen it again returned my memory little old priest but tolerably venerable held first conference at which we were all convened on part my comrades it was rather catechism than controversy he found more pains giving them instruction than answering their objections but when it came my turn it was different matter i stopped him at every article did not spare single remark that i thought would create difficulty this rendered conference long extremely tiresome assistants my old priest talked great deal was very warm frequently rambled from subject extricated himself from difficulties by saying he was not sufficiently versed french language next day lest my indiscreet objections should injure minds those who were better disposed i was led into separate chamber put under care younger priest fine speaker that is one who was fond long perplexed sentences proud his own abilities if ever doctor was i did not however suffer myself be intimidated by his overbearing looks being sensible that i could maintain my ground i combated his assertions exposed his mistakes laid about me best manner i was able he thought silence me at once with st augustine st gregory rest fathers but found his ineffable surprise that i could handle these almost as dexterously as himself not that i had ever read them or he either perhaps but i retained number passages taken from my le sueur when he bore hard on me with one citation without standing dispute i parried it with another which method embarrassed him extremely at length however he got better me for two very potent reasons first place he was strongest side young as i was i thought it might be dangerous drive him extremities for i plainly saw old priest was neither satisfied with me nor my erudition next place he had studied i had not this gave degree method his arguments which i could not follow whenever he found himself pressed by unforeseen objection he put it off next conference pretending i rambled from question dispute sometimes he even rejected all my quotations maintaining they were false offering fetch book defied me find them he knew he ran very little risk that with all my borrowed learning i was not sufficiently accustomed books too poor latinist find passage large volume had i been ever so well assured it was there i even suspected him having been guilty perfidy with which he accused our ministers that he fabricated passages sometimes order evade objection that incommoded him meanwhile hospital became every day more disagreeable me seeing but one way get out it i endeavored hasten my abjuration with as much eagerness as i had hitherto sought retard it two africans had been baptised with great ceremony they were habited white from head foot signify purity their regenerated souls my turn came month after for all this time was thought necessary by my directors that they might have honor difficult conversion every dogma their faith was recapitulated order triumph more completely over my new docility at length sufficiently instructed disposed will my masters i was led procession metropolitan church st john make solemn abjuration undergo ceremony made use on these occasions which though not baptism is very similar serves persuade people that protestants are not christians i was clothed kind gray robe decorated with white brandenburgs two men one behind other before me carried copper basins which they kept striking with key which those who were charitably disposed put their alms according as they found themselves influenced by religion or good will for new convert word nothing catholic pageantry was omitted that could render solemnity edifying populace or humiliating me white dress might have been serviceable but as i had not honor be either moor or jew they did not think fit compliment me with it affair did not end here i must now go inquisition be absolved from dreadful sin heresy return bosom church with same ceremony which henry fourth was subjected by his ambassador air manner right reverend father inquisitor was by no means calculated dissipate secret horror that seized my spirits on entering this holy mansion after several questions relative my faith situation family he asked me bluntly if my mother was damned terror repressed first gust indignation this gave me time recollect myself i answered i hope not for god might have enlightened her last moments monk made no reply but his silence was attended with look by no means expressive approbation all these ceremonies ended very moment i flattered myself i should be plentifully provided for they exhorted me continue good christian live obedience grace i had received then wishing me good fortune with rather more than twenty francs small money my pocket produce above mentioned collection turned me out shut door on me i saw no more them thus moment all my flattering expectations were at end nothing remained from my interested conversion but remembrance having been made both dupe apostate it is easy imagine what sudden revolution was produced my ideas when every brilliant expectation making fortune terminated by seeing myself plunged completest misery morning i was deliberating what palace i should inhabit before night i was reduced seek my lodging street it may be supposed that i gave myself up most violent transports despair rendered more bitter by consciousness that my own folly had reduced me these extremities but truth is i experienced none these disagreeable sensations i had passed two months absolute confinement this was new me i was now emancipated sentiment i felt most forcibly was joy at my recovered liberty after slavery which had appeared tedious i was again master my time actions great city abundant resources crowded with people fortune whom my merit talents could not fail recommend me i had sufficient time before me expect this good fortune for my twenty livres seemed inexhaustible treasure which i might dispose without rendering account anyone it was first time i had found myself so rich far from giving way melancholy reflections i only adopted other hopes which self love was by no means loser never did i feel so great degree confidence security i looked on my fortune as already made was pleased think i should have no one but myself thank for acquisition it first thing i did was satisfy my curiosity by rambling all over city i seemed consider it as confirmation my liberty i went see soldiers mount guard was delighted with their military accouterment i followed processions was pleased with solemn music priests i next went see king s palace which i approached with awe but seeing others enter i followed their example no one prevented me perhaps i owed this favor small parcel i carried under my arm be that as it may i conceived high opinion my consequence from this circumstance already thought myself inhabitant there weather was hot i had walked about till i was both fatigued hungry wishing for some refreshment i went into milk house they brought me some cream cheese curds whey two slices that excellent piedmont bread which i prefer any other for five or six sous i had one most delicious meals i ever recollect have made it was time seek lodging as i already knew enough piedmontese language make myself understood this was work no great difficulty i had so much prudence that i wished adapt it rather state my purse than bent my inclinations course my inquiries i was informed that soldier s wife po street furnished lodgings servants out place at only one sou night finding one her poor beds disengaged i took possession it she was young newly married though she already had five or six children mother children lodgers all slept same chamber it continued thus while i remained there she was good natured swore like carman wore neither cap nor handkerchief but she had gentle heart was officious me both kind serviceable for several days i gave myself up pleasures independence curiosity i continued wandering about city its environs examining every object that seemed curious or new indeed most things had that appearance young novice i never omitted visiting court assisted regularly every morning at king s mass i thought it great honor be same chapel with this prince his retinue but my passion for music which now began make its appearance was greater incentive than splendor court which soon seen always same presently lost its attraction king sardinia had at that time best music europe somis desjardins bezuzzi shone there alternately all these were not necessary fascinate youth whom sound most simple instrument provided it was just transported with joy magnificence only produced stupid admiration without any violent desire partake it my thoughts were principally employed observing whether any young princess was present that merited my homage whom i could make heroine romance meantime i was on point beginning one less elevated sphere it is true but where could i have brought it conclusion i should have found pleasures thousand times more delicious though i lived with strictest economy my purse insensibly grew lighter this economy was however less effect prudence than that love simplicity which even this day use most expensive tables has not been able vitiate nothing my idea either at that time or since could exceed rustic repast give me milk vegetables eggs brown bread with tolerable wine i shall always think myself sumptuously regaled good appetite will furnish out rest if maitre d hotel with number unnecessary footmen do not satiate me with their important attentions five or six sous would then procure me more agreeable meal than as many livres would have done since i was abstemious therefore for want temptation be otherwise though i do not know but i am wrong call this abstinence for with my pears new cheese bread some glasses montferrat wine which you might have cut with knife i was greatest epicures notwithstanding my expenses were very moderate it was possible see end twenty livres i was every day more convinced this spite giddiness youth my apprehensions for future amounted almost terror all my castles air were vanished i became sensible necessity seeking some occupation that would procure me subsistence even this was work difficulty i thought my engraving but knew too little it be employed as journeyman nor do masters abound turin i resolved therefore till something better presented itself go from shop shop offering engrave ciphers or coats arms on pieces plate etc hoped get employment by working at low price or taking what they chose give me even this expedient did not answer my expectations almost all my applications were ineffectual little i procured being hardly sufficient produce few scanty meals walking one morning pretty early contra nova i saw young tradeswoman behind counter whose looks were so charmingly attractive that notwithstanding my timidity with ladies i entered shop without hesitation offered my services as usual had happiness have it accepted she made me sit down recite my little history pitied my forlorn situation bade me be cheerful endeavored make me so by assurance that every good christian would give me assistance then while she had occasion for she went up stairs fetched me something for breakfast this seemed promising beginning nor was what followed less flattering she was satisfied with my work when i had little recovered myself still more with my discourse she was rather elegantly dressed notwithstanding her gentle looks this appearance gayety had disconcerted me but her good nature compassionate tone her voice with her gentle caressing manner soon set me at ease with myself i saw my endeavors please were crowned with success this assurance made me succeed more though italian too pretty be entirely devoid coquetry she had so much modesty i so great share timidity that our adventure was not likely be brought very speedy conclusion nor did they give us time make any good it i cannot recall few short moments i passed with this lovely woman without being sensible inexpressible charm can yet say it was there i tasted their utmost perfection most delightful as well as purest pleasures love she was lively pleasing brunette good nature that was painted on her lovely face rendered her vivacity more interesting she was called madam basile her husband who was considerably older than herself consigned her during his absence care clerk too disagreeable be thought dangerous but who notwithstanding had pretensions that he seldom showed any signs except ill humors good share which he bestowed on me though i was pleased hear him play flute on which he was tolerable musician this second egistus was sure grumble whenever he saw me go into his mistress apartment treating me with degree disdain which she took care repay him with interest seeming pleased caress me his presence on purpose torment him this kind revenge though perfectly my taste would have been still more charming tete tete but she did not proceed so far at least there was difference expression her kindness whether she thought me too young that it was my place make advances or that she was seriously resolved be virtuous she had at such times kind reserve which though not absolutely discouraging kept my passion within bounds i did not feel same real tender respect for her as i did for madam de warens i was embarrassed agitated feared look hardly dared breathe her presence yet have left her would have been worse than death how fondly did my eyes devour whatever they could gaze on without being perceived flowers on her gown point her pretty foot interval round white arm that appeared between her glove ruffle least part her neck each object increased force all rest added infatuation gazing thus on what was be seen even more than was be seen my sight became confused my chest seemed contracted respiration was every moment more painful i had utmost difficulty hide my agitation prevent my sighs from being heard this difficulty was increased by silence which we were frequently plunged happily madam basile busy at her work saw nothing all this or seemed not see it yet i sometimes observed kind sympathy especially at frequent rising her handkerchief this dangerous sight almost mastered every effort but when on point giving way my transports she spoke few words me with air tranquility instant agitation subsided i saw her several times this manner without word gesture or even look too expressive making least intelligence between us situation was both my torment delight for hardly simplicity my heart could i imagine cause my uneasiness i should suppose these tete tete could not be displeasing her at least she sought frequent occasions renew them this was very disinterested labor certainly as appeared by use she made or ever suffered me make them being one day wearied with clerk s discourse she had retired her chamber i made haste finish what i had do back shop followed her door was half open i entered without being perceived she was embroidering near window on opposite side room she could not see me carts streets made too much noise for me be heard she was always well dressed but this day her attire bordered on coquetry her attitude was graceful her head leaning gently forward discovered small circle her neck her hair elegantly dressed was ornamented with flowers her figure was universally charming i had uninterrupted opportunity admire it i was absolutely state ecstasy involuntary sinking on my knees i passionately extended my arms towards her certain she could not hear having no conception that she could see me but there was chimney glass at end room that betrayed all my proceedings i am ignorant what effect this transport produced on her she did not speak she did not look on me but partly turning her head with movement her finger only she pointed mat that was at her feet start up with articulate cry joy occupy place she had indicated was work moment but it will hardly be believed i dared attempt no more not even speak raise my eyes hers or rest instant on her knees though attitude which seemed render such support necessary i was dumb immovable but far enough from state tranquility agitation joy gratitude ardent indefinite wishes restrained by fear giving displeasure which my unpractised heart too much dreaded were sufficiently discernible she neither appeared more tranquil nor less intimidated than myself uneasy at my present situation confounded at having brought me there beginning tremble for effects sign which she had made without reflecting on consequences neither giving encouragement nor expressing disapprobation with her eyes fixed on her work she endeavored appear unconscious everything that passed but all my stupidity could not hinder me from concluding that she partook my embarrassment perhaps my transports was only hindered by bashfulness like mine without even that supposition giving me power surmount it five or six years older than myself every advance according my idea should have been made by her since she did nothing encourage mine i concluded they would offend her even at this time i am inclined believe i thought right she certainly had wit enough perceive that novice like me had occasion not only for encouragement but instruction i am ignorant how this animated though dumb scene would have ended or how long i should have continued immovable this ridiculous though delicious situation had we not been interrupted height my agitation i heard kitchen door open which joined madam basile s chamber who being alarmed said with quick voice action get up here s rosina rising hastily i seized one her hands which she held out me gave it two eager kisses at second i felt this charming hand press gently on my lips never my life did i enjoy so sweet moment but occasion i had lost returned no more this being conclusion our amours this may be reason why her image yet remains imprinted on my heart such charming colors which have even acquired fresh lustre since i became acquainted with world women had she been mistress least degree experience she would have taken other measures animate so youthful lover but if her heart was weak it was virtuous only suffered itself be borne away by powerful though involuntary inclination this was apparently her first infidelity i should perhaps have found more difficulty vanquishing her scruples than my own but without proceeding so far i experienced her company most inexpressible delights never did i taste with any other woman pleasures equal those two minutes which i passed at feet madam basile without even daring touch her gown i am convinced no satisfaction can be compared that we feel with virtuous woman we esteem all is transport sign with finger hand lightly pressed against my lips were only favors i ever received from madam basile yet bare remembrance these trifling condescensions continues transport me it was vain i watched two following days for another tete tete it was impossible find opportunity nor could i perceive on her part any desire forward it her behavior was not colder but more distant than usual i believe she avoided my looks for fear not being able sufficiently govern her own cursed clerk was more vexatious than ever he even became wit telling me with satirical sneer that i should unquestionably make my way among ladies i trembled lest i should have been guilty some indiscretion looking at myself as already engaged intrigue endeavored cover with air mystery inclination which hitherto certainly had no great need it this made me more circumspect my choice opportunities by resolving only seize such as should be absolutely free from danger surprise i met none another romantic folly which i could never overcome which joined my natural timidity tended directly contradict clerk s predictions is i always loved too sincerely too perfectly i may say find happiness easily attainable never were passions at same time more lively pure than mine never was love more tender more true or more disinterested freely would i have sacrificed my own happiness that object my affection her reputation was dearer than my life i could promise myself no happiness for which i would have exposed her peace mind for moment this disposition has ever made me employ so much care use so many precautions such secrecy my adventures that all them have failed word my want success with women has ever proceeded from having loved them too well return our egistus fluter it was remarkable that becoming more insupportable traitor put on appearance complaisance from first day madam basile had taken me under her protection she had endeavored make me serviceable warehouse finding i understood arithmetic tolerably well she proposed his teaching me keep books proposition that was but indifferently received by this humorist who might perhaps be fearful being supplanted as this failed my whole employ besides what engraving i had do was transcribe some bills accounts write several books over fair translate commercial letters from italian into french all at once he thought fit accept before rejected proposal saying he would teach me bookkeeping by double entry put me situation offer my services m basile on his return but there was something so false malicious ironical his air manner that it was by no means calculated inspire me with confidence madam basile replied archly that i was much obliged him for his kind offer but she hoped fortune would be more favorable my merits for it would be great misfortune with so much sense that i should only be pitiful clerk she often said she would procure me some acquaintance that might be useful she doubtless felt necessity parting with me had prudently resolved on it our mute declaration had been made on thursday sunday following she gave dinner jacobin good appearance was among guests whom she did me honor present me monk treated me very affectionately congratulated me on my late conversion mentioned several particulars my story which plainly showed he had been made acquainted with it then tapping me familiarly on cheek bade me be good keep up my spirits come see him at his convent where he should have more opportunity talk with me i judged him be person some consequence by deference that was paid him by paternal tone he assumed with madam basile be her confessor i likewise remember that his decent familiarity was attended with appearance esteem even respect for his fair penitent which then made less impression on me than at present had i possessed more experience how should i have congratulated myself on having touched heart young woman respected by her confessor table not being large enough accommodate all company small one was prepared where i had satisfaction dining with our agreeable clerk but i lost nothing with regard attention good cheer for several plates were sent side table which were certainly not intended for him thus far all went well ladies were good spirits gentlemen very gallant while madam basile did honors table with peculiar grace midst dinner we heard chaise stop at door presently some one coming up stairs it was m basile methinks i now see him entering his scarlet coat with gold buttons from that day i have held color abhorrence m basile was tall handsome man good address he entered with consequential look air taking his family unawares though none but friends were present his wife ran meet him threw her arms about his neck gave him thousand caresses which he received with utmost indifference without making any return saluted company took his place at table they were just beginning speak his journey when casting his eye on small table he asked sharp tone what lad that was madam basile answered ingenuously he then inquired whether i lodged house was answered negative why not replied he rudely since he stays here all day he might as well remain all night too monk now interfered with serious true eulogium on madam basile few words he made mine also adding that so far from blaming he ought further pious charity his wife since it was evident she had not passed bounds discretion husband answered with air petulance which restrained by presence monk he endeavored stifle it was however sufficient let me understand he had already received information me that our worthy clerk had rendered me ill office we had hardly risen from table when latter came triumph from his employer inform me i must leave house that instant never more during my life dare set foot there he took care aggravate this commission by everything that could render it cruel insulting i departed without word my heart overwhelmed with sorrow less for being obliged quit this amiable woman than at thought leaving her brutality such husband he was certainly right wish her faithful but though prudent wellborn she was italian that is say tender vindictive which made me think he was extremely imprudent using means most likely world draw on himself very evil he so much dreaded such was success my first adventure i walked several times up down street wishing get sight what my heart incessantly regretted but i could only discover her husband or vigilant clerk who perceiving me made sign with ell they used shop which was more expressive than alluring finding therefore that i was so completely watched my courage failed i went no more i wished at least find out patron she had provided me but unfortunately i did not know his name i ranged several times round convent endeavoring vain meet with him at length other events banished delightful remembrance madam basile short time i so far forgot her that i remained as simple as much novice as ever nor did my penchant for pretty women even receive any sensible augmentation her liberality had however increased my little wardrobe though she had done this with precaution prudence regarding neatness more than decoration make me comfortable rather than brilliant coat i had brought from geneva was yet wearable she only added hat some linen i had no ruffles nor would she give me any not but i felt great inclination for them she was satisfied with having put it my power keep myself clean though charge do this was unnecessary while i was appear before her few days after this catastrophe my hostess who as i have already observed was very friendly with great satisfaction informed me she had heard situation that lady rank desired see me i immediately thought myself road great adventures that being point which all my ideas tended this however did not prove so brilliant as i had conceived it i waited on lady with servant who had mentioned me she asked number questions my answers not displeasing her i immediately entered into her service not indeed quality favorite but as footman i was clothed like rest her people only difference being they wore shoulder knot which i had not as there was no lace on her livery it appeared merely tradesman s suit this was unforeseen conclusion all my great expectancies countess vercellis with whom i now lived was widow without children her husband was piedmontese but i always believed her be savoyard as i could have no conception that native piedmont could speak such good french with so pure accent she was middle aged woman noble appearance cultivated understanding being fond french literature which she was well versed her letters had expression almost elegance madam de savigne s some them might have been taken for hers my principal employ which was by no means displeasing me was write from her dictating cancer breast from which she suffered extremely not permitting her write herself madam de vercellis not only possessed good understanding but strong elevated soul i was with her during her last illness saw her suffer die without showing instant weakness or least effort constraint still retaining her feminine manners without entertaining idea that such fortitude gave her any claim philosophy word which was not yet fashion nor comprehended by her sense it is held at present this strength disposition sometimes extended almost apathy ever appearing feel as little for others as herself when she relieved unfortunate it was rather for sake acting right than from principle real commiseration i have frequently experienced this insensibility some measure during three months i remained with her it would have been natural have had esteem for young man some abilities who was incessantly under her observation that she should think as she felt her dissolution approaching that after her death he would have occasion for assistance support but whether she judged me unworthy particular attention or that those who narrowly watched all her motions gave her no opportunity think any but themselves she did nothing for me i very well recollect that she showed some curiosity know my story frequently questioning me appearing pleased when i showed her letters i wrote madam de warens or explained my sentiments but as she never discovered her own she certainly did not take right means come at them my heart naturally communicative loved display its feelings whenever i encountered similar disposition but dry cold interrogatories without any sign blame or approbation on my answers gave me no confidence not being able determine whether my discourse was agreeable or displeasing i was ever fear thought less expressing my ideas than being careful not say anything that might seem my disadvantage i have since remarked that this dry method questioning themselves into people s characters is common trick among women who pride themselves on superior understanding these imagine that by concealing their own sentiments they shall more easily penetrate into those others being ignorant that this method destroys confidence so necessary make us reveal them man on being questioned is immediately on his guard if once he supposes that without any interest his concerns you only wish set him talking either he entertains you with lies is silent or examining every word before he utters it rather chooses pass for fool than be dupe your curiosity short it is ever bad method attempt read hearts others by endeavoring conceal our own madam de vercellis never addressed word me which seemed express affection pity or benevolence she interrogated me coldly my answers were uttered with so much timidity that she doubtless entertained but mean opinion my intellects for latterly she never asked me any questions nor said anything but what was absolutely necessary for her service she drew her judgment less from what i really was than from what she had made me by considering me as footman prevented my appearing otherwise i am inclined think i suffered at that time by same interested game concealed manoeuvre which has counteracted me throughout my life given me very natural aversion for everything that has least appearance it madam de vercellis having no children her nephew count de la roque was her heir paid his court assiduously as did her principal domestics who seeing her end approaching endeavored take care themselves short so many were busy about her that she could hardly have found time think me at head her household was m lorenzy artful genius with still more artful wife who had so far insinuated herself into good graces her mistress that she was rather on footing friend than servant she had introduced niece hers as lady s maid her name was mademoiselle pontal cunning gypsy that gave herself all airs waiting woman assisted her aunt so well besetting countess that she only saw with their eyes acted through their hands i had not happiness please this worthy triumvirate i obeyed but did not wait on them not conceiving that my duty our general mistress required me be servant her servants besides this i was person that gave them some inquietude they saw i was not my proper situation feared countess would discover it likewise by placing me it decrease their portions for such sort people too greedy be just look on every legacy given others as diminution their own wealth they endeavored therefore keep me as much out her sight as possible she loved write letters her situation but they contrived give her distaste it persuading her by aid doctor that it was too fatiguing under pretence that i did not understand how wait on her they employed two great lubberly chairmen for that purpose word they managed affair so well that for eight days before she made her will i had not been permitted enter chamber afterwards i went as usual was even more assiduous than any one being afflicted at sufferings unhappy lady whom i truly respected beloved for calmness fortitude with which she bore her illness often did i shed tears real sorrow without being perceived by any one at length we lost her i saw her expire she had lived like woman sense virtue her death was that philosopher i can truly say she rendered catholic religion amiable me by serenity with which she fulfilled its dictates without any mixture negligence or affectation she was naturally serious but towards end her illness she possessed kind gayety too regular be assumed which served as counterpoise melancholy her situation she only kept her bed two days continuing discourse cheerfully with those about her very last she had bequeathed year s wages all under servants but not being on household list i had nothing count de la roque however ordered me thirty livres new coat i had on which m lorenzy would certainly have taken from me he even promised procure me place giving me permission wait on him as often as i pleased accordingly i went two or three times without being able speak him as i was easily repulsed returned no more whether i did wrong will be seen hereafter would i had finished what i have say my living at madam de vercellis s though my situation apparently remained same i did not leave her house as i had entered it i carried with me long painful remembrance crime insupportable weight remorse which yet hangs on my conscience whose bitter recollection far from weakening during period forty years seems gather strength as i grow old who would believe that childish fault should be productive such melancholy consequences but it is for more than probable effects that my heart cannot be consoled i have perhaps caused amiable honest estimable girl who surely merited better fate than myself perish with shame misery though it is very difficult break up housekeeping without confusion loss some property yet such was fidelity domestics vigilance m madam lorenzy that no article inventory was found wanting short nothing was missing but pink silver ribbon which had been worn belonged mademoiselle pontal though several things more value were my reach this ribbon alone tempted me accordingly i stole it as i took no great pains conceal bauble it was soon discovered they immediately insisted on knowing from whence i had taken it this perplexed me i hesitated at length said with confusion that marion gave it me marion was young mauriennese had been cook madam de vercellis ever since she left off giving entertainments for being sensible she had more need good broths than fine ragouts she had discharged her former one marion was not only pretty but had that freshness color only be found among mountains above all air modesty sweetness which made it impossible see her without affection she was besides good girl virtuous such strict fidelity that everyone was surprised at hearing her named they had not less confidence me judged it necessary certify which us was thief marion was sent for great number people were present among whom was count de la roque she arrives they show her ribbon i accuse her boldly she remains confused speechless casting look on me that would have disarmed demon but which my barbarous heart resisted at length she denied it with firmness but without anger exhorting me return myself not injure innocent girl who had never wronged me with infernal impudence i confirmed my accusation her face maintained she had given me ribbon on which poor girl bursting into tears said these words ah rousseau i thought you good disposition you render me very unhappy but i would not be your situation she continued defend herself with as much innocence as firmness but without uttering least invective against me her moderation compared my positive tone did her injury as it did not appear natural suppose on one side such diabolical assurance on other such angelic mildness affair could not be absolutely decided but presumption was my favor count de la roque sending us both away contented himself with saying conscience guilty would revenge innocent his prediction was true is being daily verified i am ignorant what became victim my calumny but there is little probability her having been able place herself agreeably after this as she labored under imputation cruel her character every respect theft was trifle yet it was theft what was worse employed seduce boy while lie obstinacy left nothing hope from person whom so many vices were united i do not even look on misery disgrace which i plunged her as greatest evil who knows at her age whither contempt disregarded innocence might have led her alas if remorse for having made her unhappy is insupportable what must i have suffered at thought rendering her even worse than myself cruel remembrance this transaction sometimes so troubles disorders me that my disturbed slumbers i imagine i see this poor girl enter reproach me with my crime as though i had committed it but yesterday while easy tranquil circumstances i was less miserable on this account but during troubled agitated life it has robbed me sweet consolation persecuted innocence made me wofully experience what i think i have remarked some my works that remorse sleeps calm sunshine prosperity but wakes amid storms adversity i could never take on me discharge my heart this weight bosom friend nor could closest intimacy ever encourage me it even with madam de warens all i could do was own i had accuse myself atrocious crime but never said what it consisted weight therefore has remained heavy on my conscience this day i can truly own desire relieving myself some measure from it contributed greatly resolution writing my confessions i have proceeded truly that i have just made it will certainly be thought i have not sought palliate turpitude my offence but i should not fulfill purpose this undertaking did i not at same time divulge my interior disposition excuse myself as far as is conformable with truth never was wickedness further from my thoughts than that cruel moment when i accused unhappy girl it is strange but strictly true that my friendship for her was immediate cause it she was present my thoughts i formed my excuse from first object that presented itself i accused her with doing what i meant have done as i designed have given her ribbon asserted she had given it me when she appeared my heart was agonized but presence so many people was more powerful than my compunction i did not fear punishment but i dreaded shame i dreaded it more than death more than crime more than all world i would have buried hid myself centre earth invincible shame bore down every other sentiment shame alone caused all my impudence proportion as i became criminal fear discovery rendered me intrepid i felt no dread but that being detected being publicly my face declared thief liar calumniator unconquerable fear this overcame every other sensation had i been left myself i should infallibly have declared truth or if m de la roque had taken me aside said do not injure this poor girl if you are guilty own it i am convinced i should instantly have thrown myself at his feet but they intimidated instead encouraging me i was hardly out my childhood or rather was yet it it is also just make some allowance for my age youth dark premeditated villainy is more criminal than riper age but weaknesses are much less so my fault was truly nothing more i am less afflicted at deed itself than for its consequences it had one good effect however preserving me through rest my life from any criminal action from terrible impression that has remained from only one i ever committed i think my aversion for lying proceeds great measure from regret at having been guilty so black one if it is crime that can be expiated as i dare believe forty years uprightness honor on various difficult occasions with many misfortunes that have overwhelmed my latter years may have completed it poor marion has found so many avengers this world that however great my offence towards her i do not fear bear guilt with me thus have i disclosed what i had say on this painful subject may i be permitted never mention it again book iii leaving service madam de vercellis nearly as i had entered it i returned my former hostess remained there five or six weeks during which time health youth laziness frequently rendered my temperament importunate i was restless absent thoughtful i wept sighed for happiness i had no idea though at same time highly sensible some deficiency this situation is indescribable few men can even form any conception it because general they have prevented that plenitude life at once tormenting delicious my thoughts were incessantly occupied with girls women but manner peculiar myself these ideas kept my senses perpetual disagreeable activity though fortunately they did not point out means deliverance i would have given my life have met with miss goton but time was past which play infancy predominated increase years had introduced shame inseparable companion conscious deviation from rectitude which so confirmed my natural timidity as render it invincible never either at that time or since could i prevail on myself offer proposition favorable my wishes unless manner constrained it by previous advances even with those whose scruples i had no cause dread my stay at madam de vercellis s had procured me some acquaintance which i thought might be serviceable me therefore wished retain among others i sometimes visited savoyard abbe m gaime who was tutor count melarede s children he was young not much known but possessed excellent cultivated understanding with great probity was altogether one best men i ever knew he was incapable doing me service i then stood most need not having sufficient interest procure me situation but from him i reaped advantages far more precious which have been useful me through life lessons pure morality maxims sound judgment successive order my inclinations ideas i had ever been too high or too low achilles or thersites sometimes hero at others villain m gaime took pains make me properly acquainted with myself without sparing or giving me too much discouragement he spoke advantageous terms my disposition talents adding that he foresaw obstacles which would prevent my profiting by them thus according him they were serve less as steps by which i should mount fortune than as resources which might enable me exist without one he gave me true picture human life which hitherto i had formed but very erroneous idea teaching me that man understanding though destined experience adverse fortune might by skilful management arrive at happiness that there was no true felicity without virtue which was practicable every situation he greatly diminished my admiration grandeur by proving that those superior situation are neither better nor happier than those they command one his maxims has frequently returned my memory it was that if we could truly read hearts others we should feel more inclination descend than rise this reflection truth which is striking without extravagance i have found great utility various exigences my life as it tended make me satisfied with my condition he gave me first just conception relative duties which my high flown imagination had ever pictured extremes making me sensible that enthusiasm sublime virtues is little use society that while endeavoring rise too high we are danger falling that virtuous uniform discharge little duties requires as great degree fortitude as actions which are called heroic would at same time procure more honor happiness that it was infinitely more desirable possess lasting esteem those about us than at intervals attract admiration properly arranging various duties between man man it was necessary ascend principles step i had recently taken which my present situation was consequence naturally led us speak religion it will easily be conceived that honest m gaime was great measure original savoyard vicar prudence only obliging him deliver his sentiments on certain points with more caution reserve explain himself with less freedom but his sentiments councils were same not even excepting his advice return my country all was precisely as i have since given it pubic dwelling no longer therefore on conversations which everyone may see substance i shall only add that these wise instructions though they did not produce immediate effect were as so many seeds virtue religion my heart which were never rooted out only required fostering cares friendship bring maturity though my conversation was not very sincere i was affected by his discourses far from being weary was pleased with them on account their clearness simplicity but above all because his heart seemed interested what he said my disposition is naturally tender i have ever been less attached people for good they have really done me than for that they designed do my feelings this particular have seldom misled me thus i truly esteemed m gaime i was manner his second disciple which even at that time was inestimable service turning me from propensity vice into which my idleness was leading me one day when i least expected it i was sent for by count de la roque having frequently called at his house without being able speak with him i grew weary supposing he had either forgot me or retained some unfavorable impression me returned no more but i was mistaken both these conjectures he had more than once witnessed pleasure i took fulfilling my duty his aunt he had even mentioned it her afterwards spoke it when i no longer thought it myself he received me graciously saying that instead amusing me with useless promises he had sought place me advantage that he had succeeded would put me way better my situation but rest must depend on myself that family into which he should introduce me being both powerful esteemed i should need no other patrons though at first on footing servant i might be assured that if my conduct sentiments were found above that station i should not long remain it end this discourse cruelly disappointed brilliant hopes beginning had inspired what forever footman said i myself with bitterness which confidence presently effaced for i felt myself too superior that situation fear long remaining there he took me count de gauvon master horse queen chief illustrious house solar air dignity conspicuous this respectable old man rendered affability with which he received me yet more interesting he questioned me with evident interest i replied with sincerity he then told count de la roque that my features were agreeable promised intellect which he believed i was not deficient but that was not enough time must show rest after which turning me he said child almost all situations are attended with difficulties beginning yours however shall not have too great portion them be prudent endeavor please everyone that will be almost your only employment for rest fear nothing you shall be taken care immediately after he went marchioness de breil his daughter law whom he presented me then abbe de gauvon his son i was elated with this beginning as i knew enough world already conclude that so much ceremony is not generally used at reception footman fact i was not treated like one i dined at steward s table did not wear livery count de favria giddy youth having commanded me get behind his coach his grandfather ordered that i should get behind no coach nor follow any one out house meantime i waited at table did within doors business footman but i did it as it were my own free will without being appointed any particular service except writing some letters which were dictated me cutting out some ornaments for count de favria i was almost absolute master my time this trial my discretion which i did not then perceive was certainly very dangerous not very humane for this state idleness i might have contracted vices which i should not otherwise have given into fortunately it did not produce that effect my memory retained lessons m gaime they had made impression on my heart i sometimes escaped from house my patron obtain repetition them i believe those who saw me going out apparently by stealth had no conception my business nothing could be more prudent than advice he gave me respecting my conduct my beginning was admirable so much attention assiduity zeal had charmed everyone abby gaime advised me moderate this first ardor lest i should relax that relaxation should be considered as neglect your setting out said he is rule what will be expected you endeavor gradually increase your attentions but be cautious how you diminish them as they paid but little attention my trifling talents supposed i possessed no more than nature had given me there was no appearance notwithstanding promises count de gauvon my meeting with any particular consideration some objects more consequence had intervened marquis de breil son count de gauvon was then ambassador at vienna some circumstances had occurred at that court which for some weeks kept family continual agitation left them no time think me meantime i had relaxed but little my attentions though one object family did me both good harm making me more secure from exterior dissipation but less attentive my duty mademoiselle de breil was about my own age tolerably handsome very fair complexioned with black hair which notwithstanding gave her features that air softness so natural flaxen which my heart could never resist court dress so favorable youth showed her fine neck shape advantage mourning which was then worn seemed add her beauty it will be said domestic should not take notice these things i was certainly blame yet i perceived all this nor was i only one maitre d hotel valet de chambre spoke her sometimes at table with vulgarity that pained me extremely my head however was not sufficiently turned allow my being entirely love i did not forget myself or my situation i loved see mademoiselle de breil hear her utter anything that marked wit sense or good humor my ambition confined desire waiting on her never exceeded its just rights at table i was ever attentive make most them if her footman quitted her chair i instantly supplied his place default this i stood facing her seeking her eyes what she was about ask for watching moment change her plate what would i not have given hear her command have her look at or speak smallest word me but no i had mortification be beneath her regard she did not even perceive i was there her brother who frequently spoke me while at table having one day said something which i did not consider obliging i made him so arch well turned answer that it drew her attention she cast her eyes upon me this glance was sufficient fill me with transport next day second occasion presented itself which i fortunately made use great dinner was given i saw with astonishment for first time maitre d hotel waiting at table with sword by his side hat on his head by chance discourse turned on motto house solar which was with arms worked tapestry tel fiert qui ne fue pas as piedmontese are not general very perfect french language they found fault with orthography saying that word fiert there should be no t old count de gauvon was going reply when happening cast his eyes on me he perceived i smiled without daring say anything he immediately ordered me speak my opinion i then said i did not think t superfluous fiert being old french word not derived from noun ferus proud threatening but from verb ferit he strikes he wounds motto therefore did not appear mean some threat but some strike who do not kill whole company fixed their eyes on me then on each other without speaking word never was greater degree astonishment but what most flattered me was air satisfaction which i perceived on countenance mademoiselle de breil this scornful lady deigned cast on me second look at least as valuable as former turning her grandfather appeared wait with impatience for praise that was due me which he fully bestowed with such apparent satisfaction that it was eagerly chorused by whole table this interval was short but delightful many respects it was one those moments so rarely met with which place things their natural order revenge depressed merit for injuries fortune some minutes after mademoiselle de breil again raised her eyes desiring me with voice timid affability give her some drink it will easily be supposed i did not let her wait but advancing towards her i was seized with such trembling that having filled glass too full i spilled some water on her plate even on herself her brother asked me giddily why i trembled thus this question increased my confusion while face mademoiselle de breil was suffused with crimson blush here ended romance where it may be remarked as with madam basile others continuation my life that i was not fortunate conclusion my amours vain i placed myself antechamber madam de breil i could not obtain one mark attention from her daughter she went out without looking at me nor had i confidence raise my eyes her i was even so foolishly stupid that one day on dropping her glove as she passed instead seizing covering it with kisses as i would gladly have done i did not dare quit my place but suffered it be taken up by great booby footman whom i could willingly have knocked down for his officiousness complete my timidity i perceived i had not good fortune please madam de breil she not only never ordered but even rejected my services having twice found me her antechamber asked me dryly if i had nothing do i was obliged therefore renounce this dear antechamber at first it caused me some uneasiness but other things intervening i presently thought no more it disdain madam de breil was fully compensated by kindness her father law who at length began think me evening after entertainment i have already mentioned he had conversation with me that lasted half hour which appeared satisfy him absolutely enchanted me this good man had less sense than madam de vercellis but possessed more feeling i therefore succeeded much better with him he bade me attach myself his son abbe gauvon who had esteem for me which if i took care cultivate might be serviceable furnishing me with what was necessary complete their views for my future establishment next morning i flew m abbe who did not receive me as servant but made me sit by his fireside questioned me with great affability he soon found that my education which had attempted many things had completed none but observing that i understood something latin he undertook teach me more appointed me attend him every morning thus by one whimsicalities which have marked whole course my life at once above below my natural situation i was pupil footman same house though servitude had preceptor whose birth entitled him supply that place only children kings abbe de gauvon was younger son designed by his family for bishopric for which reason his studies had been pursued further than is usual with people quality he had been sent university sienna where he had resided some years from whence he had brought good portion cruscantism designing be that at turin which abbe de dangeau was formerly at paris being disgusted with theology he gave belle lettres which is very frequent italy with those who have entered career prelacy he had studied poets wrote tolerable latin italian verses word his taste was calculated form mine give some order that chaos insignificant trash with which my brain was encumbered but whether my prating had misled him or that he could not support trouble teaching elementary parts latin he put me at first too high i had scarcely translated few fables phoedrus before he put me into virgil where i could hardly understand anything it will be seen hereafter that i was destined frequently learn latin but never attain it i labored with assiduity abbe bestowed his attention with degree kindness remembrance which even at this time both interests softens me i passed greater part morning with him as much for my own instruction as his service not that he ever permitted me perform any menial office but copy or write from his dictating my employment secretary was more useful than that scholar by this means i not only learned italian its utmost purity but also acquired taste for literature some discernment composition which could not have been at la tribu s which was useful me when i afterwards wrote alone at this period my life without being romantic i might reasonably have indulged hope preferment abbe thoroughly pleased with me expressed his satisfaction everyone while his father had such singular affection for me that i was assured by count de favria that he had spoken me king even madam de breil had laid aside her disdainful looks short i was general favorite which gave great jealousy other servants who seeing me honored by instructions their master s son were persuaded i should not remain their equal as far as i could judge by some words dropped at random which i reflected on afterwards it appeared me that house solar wishing run career embassies hoping perhaps time arrive at ministry wished provide themselves with person merit talents who depending entirely on them might obtain their confidence be essential service this project count de gauvon was judicious magnanimous truly worthy powerful nobleman equally provident generous but besides my not seeing at that time its full extent it was far too rational for my brain required too much confinement my ridiculous ambition sought for fortune midst brilliant adventures not finding one woman all this scheme it appeared tedious painful melancholy though i should rather have thought it more honorable on this account as species merit generally patronized by women is certainly less worthy that i was supposed possess everything succeeded my wish i had obtained almost forced esteem all trial was over i was universally considered as young man with flattering prospects who was not at present his proper sphere but was expected soon reach it but my place was not assigned me by man i was reach it by very difficult paths i now come one those characteristic traits which are so natural me which indeed reader might have observed without this reflection there were at turin several new converts my own stamp whom i neither liked nor wish see but i had met with some genevese who were not this description among others m mussard nicknamed wryneck miniature painter distant relation this m mussard having learned my situation at count de gauvon s came see me with another genevese named bacle who had been my comrade during my apprenticeship this bacle was very sprightly amusing young fellow full lively sallies which at his time life appeared extremely agreeable at once then behold me delighted with m bacle charmed such degree that i found it impossible quit him he was shortly depart for geneva what loss had i sustain i felt whole force it resolving make best use this precious interval i determined not leave him or rather he never quitted me for my head was not yet sufficiently turned think quitting house without leave but it was soon perceived that he engrossed my whole time he was accordingly forbid house this so incensed me that forgetting everything but my friend bacle i went neither abbe nor count was no longer be found at home i paid no attention repeated reprimands at length was threatened with dismissal this threat was my ruin as it suggested idea that it was not absolutely necessary that bacle should depart alone from that moment i could think no other pleasure no other situation or happiness than taking this journey render felicity still more complete at end it though at immense distance i pictured myself madam de warens for as returning geneva it never entered into my imagination hills fields brooks villages incessantly succeeded each other with new charms this delightful jaunt seemed worthy absorb my whole existence memory recalled with inexpressible pleasure how charming country had appeared coming turin what then must it be when pleasure independence should be added company good humored comrade my own age disposition without any constraint or obligation but free go or stay as we pleased would it not be madness sacrifice prospect so much felicity projects ambition slow difficult their execution uncertain their event but even supposing them realized their utmost splendor they were not worth one quarter hour sweet pleasure liberty youth full these wise conclusions i conducted myself so improperly that not indeed without some trouble i got myself dismissed for on my return one night maitre de hotel gave me warning on part count this was exactly what i wanted for feeling spite myself extravagance my conduct i wished excuse it by addition injustice ingratitude by throwing blame on others sheltering myself under idea necessity i was told count de favria wished speak with me next morning before my departure but being sensible that my head was so far turned as render it possible for me disobey injunction maitre de hotel declined paying money designed me which certainly i had very ill earned till after this visit for my kind patrons being unwilling place me situation footman i had not any fixed wages count de favria though young giddy talked me on this occasion most sensible serious manner i might add if it would not be thought vain with utmost tenderness he reminded me most flattering terms cares his uncle intentions his grandfather after having drawn lively colors what i was sacrificing ruin he offered make my peace without stipulating any conditions but that i should no more see worthless fellow who had seduced me it was so apparent that he did not say all this himself that notwithstanding my blind stupidity i powerfully felt kindness my good old master but dear journey was too firmly printed on my imagination for any consideration balance charm bereft understanding firm my purpose i hardened myself against conviction arrogantly answered that as they had thought fit give me warning i had resolved take it conceived it was now too late retract since whatever might happen me i was fully resolved not be driven second time from same house count justly irritated bestowed on me some names which i deserved putting me out his apartment by shoulders shut door on me i departed triumphant as if i had gained greatest victory fearful sustaining second combat even had ingratitude leave house without thanking abbe for his kindness form just conception my delirium at that moment excess which my heart is subject be heated by most trifling incidents ardor with which my imagination seizes on most attractive objects should be conceived at these times plans most ridiculous childish void sense flatter my favorite idea persuade me that it is reasonable sacrifice everything possession it would it be believed that when near nineteen any one could be so stupid as build his hopes future subsistence on empty phial for example abbe de gauvon had made me present some weeks before very pretty heron fountain with which i was highly delighted playing with this toy speaking our departure sage bacle myself thought it might be infinite advantage enable us lengthen our journey what world was so curious as heron fountain this idea was foundation on which we built our future fortune we were assemble country people every village we might pass through delight them with sight it when feasting good cheer would be sure pour on us abundantly for we were both firmly persuaded that provisions could cost nothing those who grew gathered them if they did not stuff travellers it was downright ill nature we pictured all parts entertainments weddings reckoning that without any expense but wind from our lungs water our fountain we should be maintained through piedmont savoy france indeed all world over there was no end our projected travels we immediately directed our course northward rather for pleasure crossing alps than from supposed necessity being obliged stop at any place such was plan on which i set out abandoning without regret my preceptors studies hopes with almost certain attainment fortune lead life real vagabond farewell capital adieu court ambition love fair all great adventures into which hope had led me during preceding year i departed with my fountain my friend bacle purse lightly furnished but heart over flowing with pleasure only thinking how enjoy extensive felicity which i supposed my project encircled this extravagant journey was performed almost as agreeably as i had expected though not exactly on same plan not but our fountain highly amused hostess servants for some minutes at all ale houses where we halted yet we found it equally necessary pay on our departure but that gave us no concern as we never thought depending on it entirely until our money should be expended accident spared us that trouble our fountain was broken near bramant good time for we both felt though without daring own it each other that we began be weary it this misfortune rendered us gayer than ever we laughed heartily at our giddiness having forgotten that our clothes shoes would wear out or trusting renew them by play our fountain we continued our journey as merrily as we had begun it only drawing faster towards that termination where our drained purses made it necessary for us arrive at chambery i became pensive not for folly i had committed for never did any one think less past but on account reception i should meet with from madam de warens for i looked on her house as my paternal home i had written her account my reception at count de gauvon s she knew my expectancies congratulating me on my good fortune had added some wise lessons on return i ought make for kindness with which they treated me she looked on my fortune as already made if not destroyed by my own negligence what then would she say on my arrival for it never entered my mind that she might shut door against me but i dreaded uneasiness i might give her i dreaded her reproaches me more wounding than want i resolved bear all silence if possible appease her i now saw nothing but madam de warens whole universe live disgrace with her was impossible i was most concerned about my companion whom i did not wish offend feared i should not easily get rid i prefaced this separation by affected coldness during last day s journey drole understood me perfectly fact he was rather giddy than deficient point sense i expected he would have been hurt at my inconstancy but i was quite mistaken nothing affected my friend bacle for hardly had we set foot town on our arrival annecy before he said you are now at home embraced bade me adieu turned on his heel disappeared nor have i ever heard him since how did my heart beat as i approached habitation madam de warens my legs trembled under me my eyes were clouded with mist i neither saw heard nor recollected any one was obliged frequently stop that i might draw breath recall my bewildered senses was it fear not obtaining that succor i stood need which agitated me this degree at age i then was does fear perishing with hunger give such alarms no i declare with as much truth as pride that it was not power interest or indigence at any period my life expand or contract my heart course painful life memorable for its vicissitudes frequently destitute asylum without bread i have contemplated with equal indifference both opulence misery want i might have begged or stolen as others have done but never could feel distress at being reduced such necessities few men have grieved more than myself few have shed so many tears yet never did poverty or fear falling into it make me heave sigh or moisten my eyelids my soul despite fortune has only been sensible real good evil which did not depend on her frequently when possession everything that could make life pleasing i have been most miserable mortals first glance madam de warens banished all my fears my heart leaped at sound her voice i threw myself at her feet transports most lively joy pressed my lips upon her hand i am ignorant whether she had received any recent information me i discovered but little surprise on her countenance no sorrow poor child said she affectionate tone art thou here again i knew you were too young for this journey i am very glad however that it did not turn out so bad as i apprehended she then made me recount my history it was not long i did it faithfully suppressing only some trifling circumstances but on whole neither sparing nor excusing myself question was where i could lodge she consulted her maid on this point i hardly dared breathe during deliberation but when i heard i was sleep house i could scarce contain my joy saw little bundle i brought with me carried into my destined apartment with much same sensations as st preux saw his chaise put up at madam de wolmar s complete all i had satisfaction find that this favor was not be transitory for at moment when they thought me attentive something else i heard madam de warens say they may talk as they please but since providence has sent him back i am determined not abandon him behold me then established at her house not however that i date happiest days my life from this period but this served prepare me for them though that sensibility heart which enables us truly enjoy our being is work nature perhaps mere effect organization yet it requires situations unfold itself without certain concurrence favorable circumstances man born with most acute sensibility may go out world without ever having been acquainted with his own temperament this was my case till that time such perhaps it might have remained had i never known madam de warens or even having known her had i not remained with her long enough contract that pleasing habit affectionate sentiments with which she inspired me i dare affirm that those who only love do not feel most charming sensations we are capable i am acquainted with another sentiment less impetuous but thousand times more delightful sometimes joined with love but frequently separated from it this feeling is not simply friendship it is more enchanting more tender nor do i imagine it can exist between persons same sex at least i have been truly friend if ever man was yet never experienced it that kind this distinction is not sufficiently clear but will become so hereafter sentiments are only distinguishable by their effects madam de warens inhabited old house but large enough have handsome spare apartment which she made her drawing room i now occupied this chamber which was passage i have before mentioned as place our first meeting beyond brook gardens was prospect country which was by no means uninteresting young inhabitant being first time since my residence at bossey that i had seen anything before my windows but walls roofs or dirty street how pleasing then was this novelty it helped increase tenderness my disposition for i looked on this charming landscape as gift my dear patroness who i could almost fancy had placed it there on purpose for me peaceably seated my eyes pursued her amidst flowers verdure her charms seemed me confounded with those spring my heart till now contracted here found means expand itself my sighs exhaled freely this charming retreat magnificence i had been accustomed at turin was not be found at madam de warens but lieu it there was neatness regularity patriarchal abundance which is seldom attached pompous ostentation she had very little plate no china no game her kitchen or foreign wines her cellar but both were well furnished at every one s service her coffee though served earthenware cups was excellent whoever came her house was invited dine there never did laborer messenger or traveller depart without refreshment her family consisted pretty chambermaid from fribourg named merceret valet from her own country called claude anet whom i shall speak hereafter cook two hired chairmen when she visited which seldom happened this was great deal be done out two thousand livres year yet with good management it might have been sufficient country where land is extremely good money very scarce unfortunately economy was never her favorite virtue she contracted debts paid them thus her money passed from hand hand like weaver s shuttle quickly disappeared arrangement her housekeeping was exactly what i should have chosen i shared it with satisfaction i was least pleased with necessity remaining too long at table madam de warens was so much incommoded with first smell soup or meat as almost occasion fainting from this she slowly recovered talking meantime never attempting eat for first half hour i could have dined thrice time had ever finished my meal long before she began i then ate again for company though by this means i usually dined twice felt no inconvenience from it short i was perfectly at my ease happier as my situation required no care not being at this time instructed state her finances i supposed her means were adequate her expense though i afterwards found same abundance yet when instructed her real situation finding her pension ever anticipated prevented me from enjoying same tranquility foresight with me has always embittered enjoyment vain i saw approach misfortunes i was never more likely avoid them from first moment our meeting softest familiarity was established between us same degree it continued during rest her life child was my name mamma was hers child mamma we have ever continued even after number years had almost effaced apparent difference age between us i think those names convey exact idea our behavior simplicity our manners above all similarity our dispositions me she was tenderest mothers ever preferring my welfare her own pleasure if my own satisfaction found some interest my attachment her it was not change its nature but only render it more exquisite infatuate me with charm having mother young handsome whom i was delighted caress i say literally caress for never did it enter into her imagination deny me tenderest maternal kisses endearments or into my heart abuse them it will be said at length our connection was different kind i confess it but have patience that will come its turn sudden sight her on our first interview was only truly passionate moment she ever inspired me with even that was principally work surprise with her i had neither transports nor desires but remained ravishing calm sensible happiness i could not define thus could i have passed my whole life or even eternity without feeling instant uneasiness she was only person with whom i never experienced that want conversation which me is so painful endure our tete tetes were rather inexhaustible chat than conversation which could only conclude from interruption so far from finding discourse difficult i rather thought it hardship be silent unless when contemplating her projects she sunk into reverie when i silently let her meditate gazing on her was happiest men i had another singular fancy which was that without pretending favor tete tete i was perpetually seeking occasion form them enjoying such opportunities with rapture when importunate visitors broke upon us no matter whether it was man or woman i went out murmuring not being able remain secondary object her company then counting minutes her antechamber i used curse these eternal visitors thinking it inconceivable how they could find so much say because i had still more if ever i felt full force my attachment it was when i did not see her when her presence i was only content when absent my uneasiness reached almost melancholy wish live with her gave me emotions tenderness even tears never shall i forget one great holiday while she was at vespers when i took walk out city my heart full her image ardent wish pass my life with her i could easily enough see that at present this was impossible that happiness i enjoyed would be short duration this idea gave my contemplations tincture melancholy which however was not gloomy but tempered with flattering hope ringing bells which ever particularly affects me singing birds fineness day beauty landscape scattered country houses among which idea i placed our future dwelling altogether struck me with impression so lively tender melancholy powerful that i saw myself ecstasy transported into that happy time abode where my heart possessing all felicity it could desire might taste it with raptures inexpressible i never recollect have enjoyed future with such force illusions as at that time what has particularly struck me recollection this reverie is that when realized i found my situation exactly as i had imagined it if ever waking dream had appearance prophetic vision it was assuredly this i was only deceived its imaginary duration for days years life itself passed ideally perfect tranquility while reality lasted but moment alas my most durable happiness was but as dream which i had no sooner had glimpse than i instantly awoke i know not when i should have done if i was enter into detail all follies that affection for my dear madam de warens made me commit when absent from her how often have i kissed bed on supposition that she had slept there curtains all furniture my chamber on recollecting they were hers that her charming hands had touched them nay floor itself when i considered she had walked there sometimes even her presence extravagancies escaped me which only most violent passions seemed capable inspiring word there was but one essential difference distinguish me from absolute lover that particular renders my situation almost inconceivable i had returned from italy not absolutely as i went there but as no one my age perhaps ever did before being equally unacquainted with women my ardent constitution had found resources those means by which youth my disposition sometimes preserve their purity at expense health vigor frequently life itself my local situation should likewise be considered living with pretty woman cherishing her image bottom my heart seeing her during whole day at night surrounded with objects that recalled her incessantly my remembrance sleeping bed where i knew she had slept what situation who can read this without supposing me on brink grave but quite contrary that which might have ruined me acted as preservative at least for time intoxicated with charm living with her with ardent desire passing my life there absent or present i saw her tender mother amiable sister respected friend but nothing more meantime her image filled my heart left room far no other object extreme tenderness with which she inspired me excluded every other woman from my consideration preserved me from whole sex word i was virtuous because i loved her let these particulars which i recount but indifferently be considered then let any one judge what kind attachment i had for her for my part all i can say is that if it hitherto appears extraordinary it will appear much more so sequel my time passed most agreeable manner though occupied way which was by no means calculated please me such as having projects digest bills write fair receipts transcribe herbs pick drugs pound or distillations attend midst all this came crowds travellers beggars visitors all denominations some times it was necessary converse at same time with soldier apothecary prebendary fine lady lay brother i grumbled swore wished all this troublesome medley at devil while she seemed enjoy it laughing at my chagrin till tears ran down her cheeks what excited her mirth still more was see that my anger was increased by not being able myself refrain from laughter these little intervals which i enjoyed pleasure grumbling were charming if during dispute another importunate visitor arrived she would add her amusement by maliciously prolonging visit meantime casting glances at me for which i could almost have beat her nor could she without difficulty refrain from laughter on seeing my constrained politeness though every moment glancing at her look fury while even spite myself i thought scene truly diverting all this without being pleasing itself contributed amuse because it made up part life which i thought delightful nothing that was performed around me nothing that i was obliged do suited my taste but everything suited my heart i believe at length i should have liked study medicine had not my natural distaste it perpetually engaged us whimsical scenes that prevented my thinking it serious light it was perhaps first time that this art produced mirth i pretended distinguish physical book by its smell what was more diverting was seldom mistaken madam de warens made me taste most nauseous drugs vain i ran or endeavored defend myself spite resistance or wry faces spite my struggles or even my teeth when i saw her charming fingers approach my lips i was obliged give up contest illustration 0098 when shut up apartment with all her medical apparatus any one who had heard us running shouting amidst peals laughter would rather have imagined we had been acting farce than preparing opiates or elixirs my time however was not entirely passed these fooleries apartment which i occupied i found few books there was spectator puffendorf st everemond henriade though i had not my old passion for books yet i amused myself with reading part them spectator was particularly pleasing serviceable me abbe de gauvon had taught me read less eagerly with greater degree attention which rendered my studies more serviceable i accustomed myself reflect on elocution elegance composition exercising myself discerning pure french from my provincial idiom for example i corrected orthographical fault which i had common with all genevese by these two lines henriade soit qu un ancient respect pour le sang de leurs maitres parlat encore pour lui dans le coeur de ces traitres i was struck with word parlat found t was necessary form third person subjunctive whereas i had always written pronounced it parla as present indicative sometimes my studies were subject conversation with madam de warens sometimes i read her which i found great satisfaction as i endeavored read well it was extremely serviceable me i have already observed that her mind was cultivated her understanding was at this time its meridian several people learning having been assiduous ingratiate themselves had taught her distinguish works merit but her taste if i may so express myself was rather protestant ever speaking warmly bayle highly esteeming st evremond though long since almost forgotten france but this did not prevent her having taste for literature or expressing her thoughts with elegance she had been brought up with polite company coming young savoy by associating with people best fashion had lost affected manners her own country where ladies mistake wit for sense only speak epigram though she had seen court but superficially that glance was sufficient give her competent idea it notwithstanding secret jealousies murmurs excited by her conduct running debt she ever preserved friends there never lost her pension she knew world was useful this was her favorite theme our conversations was directly opposite my chimerical ideas though kind instruction i particularly had occasion for we read bruyere together he pleased her more than rochefoucault who is dull melancholy author particularly youth who are not fond contemplating man as he really is moralizing she sometimes bewildered herself by length her discourse but by kissing her lips or hand from time time i was easily consoled never found them wearisome this life was too delightful be lasting i felt this uneasiness that thought gave me was only thing that disturbed my enjoyment even playfulness she studied my disposition observed interrogated me forming projects for my future fortune which i could readily have dispensed with happily it was not sufficient know my disposition inclinations talents it was likewise necessary find situation which they would be useful this was not work day even prejudices this good woman had conceived favor my merit put off time calling it into action by rendering her more difficult choice means thus thanks good opinion she entertained me everything answered my wish but change soon happened which put period my tranquility relation madam de warens named m d aubonne came see her man great understanding intrigue being like her fond projects though careful not ruin himself by them he had offered cardinal fleury very compact plan for lottery which however had not been approved he was now going propose it court turin where it was accepted put into execution he remained some time at annecy where he fell love with intendant s lady who was very amiable much my taste only person i saw with pleasure at house madam de warens m d aubonne saw me i was strongly recommended by his relation he promised therefore question see what i was fit for if he found me capable seek me situation madam de warens sent me him two or three mornings under pretense messages without acquainting me with her real intention he spoke me gayly on various subjects without any appearance observation his familiarity presently set me talking which by his cheerful jesting manner he encouraged without restraint i was absolutely charmed with him result his observations was that notwithstanding animation my countenance promising exterior if not absolutely silly i was lad very little sense without ideas learning fine very ignorant all respects if i could arrive at being curate some village it was utmost honor i ought ever aspire such was account he gave me madam de warens this was not first time such opinion had been formed me neither was it last judgment m masseron having been repeatedly confirmed cause these opinions is too much connected with my character not need particular explanation for it will not be supposed that i can conscience subscribe them with all possible impartiality whatever m masseron m d aubonne many others may have said i cannot help thinking them mistaken two things very opposite unite me manner which i cannot myself conceive my disposition is extremely ardent my passions lively impetuous yet my ideas are produced slowly with great embarrassment after much afterthought it might be said my heart understanding do not belong same individual sentiment takes possession my soul with rapidity lightning but instead illuminating it dazzles confounds me i feel all but see nothing i am warm but stupid think i must be cool what is astonishing my conception is clear penetrating if not hurried i can make excellent impromptus at leisure but on instant could never say or do anything worth notice i could hold tolerable conversation by post as they say spaniards play at chess when i read that anecdote duke savoy who turned himself round while on journey cry out votre gorge marchand de paris i said here is trait my character this slowness thought joined vivacity feeling i am not only sensible conversation but even alone when i write my ideas are arranged with utmost difficulty they glance on my imagination ferment till they discompose heat bring on palpitation during this state agitation i see nothing properly cannot write single word must wait till it is over insensibly agitation subsides chaos acquires form each circumstance takes its proper place have you never seen opera italy where during change scene everything is confusion decorations are intermingled any one would suppose that all would be overthrown yet by little little everything is arranged nothing appears wanting we feel surprised see tumult succeeded by most delightful spectacle this is resemblance what passes my brain when i attempt write had i always waited till that confusion was past then painted their natural beauties objects that had presented themselves few authors would have surpassed me thence arises extreme difficulty i find writing my manuscripts blotted scratched scarcely legible attest trouble they cost me nor is there one them but i have been obliged transcribe four or five times before it went press never could i do anything when placed at table pen hand it must be walking among rocks or woods it is at night my bed during my wakeful hours that i compose it may be judged how slowly particularly for man who has not advantage verbal memory never his life could retain by heart six verses some my periods i have turned returned my head five or six nights before they were fit be put paper thus it is that i succeed better works that require laborious attention than those that appear more trivial such as letters which i could never succeed being obliged write one is me serious punishment nor can i express my thoughts on most trivial subjects without it costing me hours fatigue if i write immediately what strikes me my letter is long confused unconnected string expressions which when read can hardly be understood it is not only painful me give language my ideas but even receive them i have studied mankind think myself tolerable observer yet i know nothing from what i see but all from what i remember nor have i understanding except my recollections from all that is said from all that passes my presence i feel nothing conceive nothing exterior sign being all that strikes me afterwards it returns my remembrance i recollect place time manner look gesture not circumstance escapes me it is then from what has been done or said that i imagine what has been thought i have rarely found myself mistaken so little master my understanding when alone let any one judge what i must be conversation where speak with any degree ease you must think thousand things at same time bare idea that i should forget something material would be sufficient intimidate me nor can i comprehend how people can have confidence converse large companies where each word must pass review before so many where it would be requisite know their several characters histories avoid saying what might give offence this particular those who frequent world would have great advantage as they know better where be silent can speak with greater confidence yet even they sometimes let fall absurdities what predicament then must he be who drops as it were from clouds it is almost impossible he should speak ten minutes with impunity tete tete there is still worse inconvenience that is necessity talking perpetually at least necessity answering when spoken keeping up conversation when other is silent this insupportable constraint is alone sufficient disgust me with variety for i cannot form idea greater torment than being obliged speak continually without time for recollection i know not whether it proceeds from my mortal hatred all constraint but if i am obliged speak i infallibly talk nonsense what is still worse instead learning how be silent when i have absolutely nothing say it is generally at such times that i have violent inclination endeavoring pay my debt conversation as speedily as possible i hastily gabble number words without ideas happy when they only chance mean nothing thus endeavoring conquer or hide my incapacity i rarely fail show it i think i have said enough show that though not fool i have frequently passed for one even among people capable judging this was more vexatious as my physiognomy eyes promised otherwise expectation being frustrated my stupidity appeared more shocking this detail which particular occasion gave birth will not be useless sequel being key many my actions which might otherwise appear unaccountable have been attributed savage humor i do not possess i love society as much as any man was i not certain exhibit myself it not only disadvantageously but totally different from what i really am plan i have adopted writing retirement is what exactly suits me had i been present my worth would never have been known no one would even have suspected it thus it was with madam dupin woman sense whose house i lived for several years indeed she has often since owned it me though on whole this rule may be subject some exceptions i shall now return my history estimate my talents thus fixed situation i was capable promised question only remained how render me capable fulfilling my destined vocation principle difficulty was i did not know latin enough for priest madam de warens determined have me taught for some time at seminary accordingly spoke it superior who was lazarist called m gras good natured little fellow half blind meagre gray haired insensible least pedantic any lazarist i ever knew which fact is saying no great matter he frequently visited madam de warens who entertained caressed made much him letting him sometimes lace her stays office he was willing enough perform while thus employed she would run about room this way or that as occasion happened call her drawn by lace monsieur superior followed grumbling repeating at every moment pray madam do stand still whole forming scene truly diverting m gras willingly assented project madam de warens for very moderate pension charged himself with care instructing me consent bishop was all that remained necessary who not only granted it but offered pay pension permitting me retain secular habit till they could judge by trial what success they might have my improvement what change but i was obliged submit though i went seminary with about same spirits as if they had been taking me execution what melancholy abode especially for one who left house pretty woman i carried one book with me that i had borrowed madam de warens found it capital resource it will not be easily conjectured what kind book this was it was music book among talents she had cultivated music was not forgotten she had tolerable good voice sang agreeably played on harpsichord she had taken pains give me some lessons singing though before i was very uninformed that respect hardly knowing music our psalms eight or ten interrupted lessons far from putting me condition improve myself did not teach me half notes notwithstanding i had such passion for art that i determined exercise myself alone book i took was not most easy kind it was cantatas clerambault it may be conceived with what attention perseverance i studied when i inform my reader that without knowing anything transposition or quantity i contrived sing with tolerable correctness first recitative air cantata alpheus arethusa it is true this air is so justly set that it is only necessary recite verses their just measure catch music there was at seminary curst lazarist who by undertaking teach me latin made me detest it his hair was coarse black greasy his face like those formed gingerbread he had voice buffalo countenance owl bristles boar lieu beard his smile was sardonic his limbs played like those puppet moved by wires i have forgotten his odious name but remembrance his frightful precise countenance remains with me though hardly can i recollect it without trembling especially when i call mind our meeting gallery when he graciously advanced his filthy square cap as sign for me enter his apartment which appeared more dismal my apprehension than dungeon let any one judge contrast between my present master elegant abbe de gauvon had i remained two months at mercy this monster i am certain my head could not have sustained it but good m gras perceiving i was melancholy grew thin did not eat my victuals guessed cause my uneasiness which indeed was not very difficult taking me from claws this beast by another yet more striking contrast placed me with gentlest men young faucigneran abbe named m gatier who studied at seminary out complaisance for m gras humanity myself spared some time from prosecution his own studies order direct mine never did i see more pleasing countenance than that m gatier he was fair complexioned his beard rather inclined red his behavior like that generality his countrymen who under coarseness countenance conceal much understanding marked him truly sensible affectionate soul his large blue eyes there was mixture softness tenderness melancholy which made it impossible see him without feeling one s self interested from looks manner this young abbe he might have been supposed have foreseen his destiny that he was born be unhappy his disposition did not belie his physiognomy full patience complaisance he rather appeared study with than instruct me so much was not necessary make me love him his predecessor having rendered that very easy yet notwithstanding all time he bestowed on me notwithstanding our mutual good inclinations that his plan teaching was excellent with much labor i made little progress it is very singular that with clear conception i could never learn much from masters except my father m lambercier little i know besides i have learned alone as will be seen hereafter my spirit impatient every species constraint cannot submit law moment even fear not learning prevents my being attentive dread wearying those who teach makes me feign understand them thus they proceed faster than i can comprehend conclusion is i learn nothing my understanding must take its own time cannot submit that another time ordination being arrived m gatier returned his province as deacon leaving me with gratitude attachment sorrow for his loss vows i made for him were no more answered than those i offered for myself some years after i learned that being vicar parish young girl was with child by him being only one though he possessed very tender heart with whom he was ever love this was dreadful scandal diocese severely governed where priests being under good regulation ought never have children except by married women having infringed this politic law he was put prison defamed driven from his benefice i know not whether it was ever after his power reestablish his affairs but remembrance his misfortunes which were deeply engraven on my heart struck me when i wrote emilius uniting m gatier with m gaime i formed from these two worthy priests character savoyard vicar flatter myself imitation has not dishonored originals while i was at seminary m d aubonne was obliged quit annecy moultou being displeased that he made love his wife which was acting like dog manger for though madam moultou was extremely amiable he lived very ill with her treating her with such brutality that separation was talked moultou by repeated oppressions at length procured dismissal from his employment he was disagreeable man mole could not be blacker nor owl more knavish it is said provincials revenge themselves on their enemies by songs m d aubonne revenged himself on his by comedy which he sent madam de warens who showed it me i was pleased with it immediately conceived idea writing one try whether i was so silly as author had pronounced me this project was not executed till i went chambery where i wrote lover himself thus when i said preface that piece it was written at eighteen i cut off few years nearly about this time event happened not very important itself but whose consequence affected me made noise world when i had forgotten it once week i was permitted go out it is not necessary say what use i made this liberty being one sunday at madam de warens building belonging cordeliers which joined her house took fire this building which contained their oven being full dry fagots blazed violently greatly endangered house for wind happening drive flames that way it was covered with them furniture therefore was hastily got out carried into garden which fronted windows on other side before mentioned brook i was so alarmed that i threw indiscriminately everything that came hand out window even large stone mortar which at another time i should have found it difficult remove should have thrown handsome looking glass after it had not some one prevented me good bishop who that day was visiting madam de warens did not remain idle he took her into garden where they went prayers with rest that were assembled there where sometime afterwards i found them on their knees presently joined them while good man was at his devotions wind changed so suddenly critically that flames which had covered house began enter windows were carried other side court house received no damage two years after monsieur de berner being dead antoines his former brethren began collect anecdotes which might serve as arguments his beatification at desire father baudet i joined these attestation what i have just related doing which though i attested no more than truth i certainly acted ill as it tended make indifferent occurrence pass for miracle i had seen bishop prayer had likewise seen wind change during prayer even much purpose all this i could certify truly but that one these facts was cause other i ought not have attested because it is what i could not possibly be assured thus much i may say that as far as i can recollect what my ideas were at that time i was sincerely good earnest catholic love marvellous is natural human heart my veneration for virtuous prelate secret pride having perhaps contributed event question all helped seduce me certainly if this miracle was effect ardent prayer i had right claim share merits more than thirty years after when i published lettres de la montagne m feron i know not by what means discovered this attestation made use it his paper i must confess discovery was very critically timed appeared very diverting even me i was destined be outcast every condition for notwithstanding m gatier gave most favorable account he possibly could my studies they plainly saw improvement i received bore no proportion pains taken instruct me which was no encouragement continue them bishop superior therefore were disheartened i was sent back madam de warens as subject not even fit make priest but as they allowed at same time that i was tolerably good lad far from being vicious this account counterbalanced former determined her not abandon me i carried back triumph dear music book which had been so useful me air alpheus arethusa being almost all i had learned at seminary my predilection for this art started idea making musician me convenient opportunity offered once week at least she had concert at her house music master from cathedral who directed this little band came frequently see her this was parisian named m le maitre good composer very lively gay young well made little understanding but upon whole good sort man madam de warens made us acquainted i attached myself him he seemed not displeased with me pension was talked agreed on short i went home with him passed winter more agreeably at his chambers as they were not above twenty paces distant from madam de warens where we frequently supped together it may easily be supposed that this situation ever gay singing with musicians children choir was more pleasing me than seminary fathers st lazarus this life though free was regular here i learned prize independence but never abuse it for six whole months i never once went out except see madam de warens or church nor had i any inclination it this interval is one those which i enjoyed greatest satisfaction which i have ever recollected with pleasure among various situations i have been placed some were marked with such idea virtuous satisfaction that bare remembrance affects me as if they were yet present i vividly recollect time place persons even temperature air while lively idea certain local impression peculiar those times transports me back again very spot for example all that was repeated at our meetings all that was sung choir everything that passed there beautiful noble habits canons chasubles priests mitres singers persons musicians old lame carpenter who played counter bass little fair abbe who performed on violin ragged cassock which m le maitre after taking off his sword used put over his secular habit fine surplice with which he covered rags former when he went choir pride with which i held my little flute my lips seated myself orchestra assist recitative which m le maitre had composed on purpose for me good dinner that afterwards awaited us good appetites we carried it this concourse objects strongly retraced my memory has charmed me hundred time as much or perhaps more than ever reality had done i have always preserved affection for certain air conditor alme syderum because one sunday advent i heard that hymn sung on steps cathedral according custom that place as i lay bed before daybreak mademoiselle merceret madam de warens chambermaid knew something music i shall never forget little piece that m le maitre made me sing with her which her mistress listened with great satisfaction word every particular even down servant perrine whom boys choir took such delight teasing remembrance these times happiness innocence frequently returning my mind both ravish affect me i lived at annecy during year without least reproach giving universal satisfaction since my departure from turin i had been guilty no folly committed none while under eye madam de warens she was my conductor ever led me right my attachment for her became my only passion what proves it was not giddy one my heart understanding were unison it is true that single sentiment absorbing all my faculties put me out capacity learning even music but this was not my fault since strongest inclination i added utmost assiduity i was attentive thoughtful what could i do nothing was wanting towards my progress that depended on me meantime it only required subject that might inspire me occasion commission new follies that subject presented itself chance arranged it as will be seen hereafter my inconsiderate head gave it one evening month february when it was very cold being all sat round fire we heard some one knock at street door perrine took light went down opened it young man entering came upstairs presented himself with easy air making m maitre short but well turned compliment announced himself as french musician constrained by state his finances take this liberty heart good le maitre leaped at name french musician for he passionately loved both his country profession he therefore offered young traveller his service use his apartment which he appeared stand much need which he accepted without much ceremony i observed him while he was chatting warming himself before supper he was short thick having some fault his shape though without any particular deformity he had if i may so express myself appearance being hunchbacked with flat shoulders i think he limped he wore black coat rather worn than old which hung tatters very fine but dirty shirt frayed ruffles pair splatterdashes so large that he could have put both legs into either them secure himself from snow little hat only fit be carried under his arm with this whimsical equipage he had however something elegant his manners conversation his countenance was expressive agreeable he spoke with facility if not with modesty short everything about him bore mark young debauchee who did not crave assistance like beggar but as thoughtless madcap he told us his name was venture de villeneuve that he came from paris had lost his way seeming forget that he had announced himself for musician added that he was going grenoble see relation that was member parliament during supper we talked music on which subject he spoke well he knew all great virtuosi all celebrated works all actors actresses pretty women powerful lords short nothing was mentioned but what he seemed thoroughly acquainted with though no sooner was any topic started than by some drollery which set every one laughing he made them forget what had been said this was on saturday next day there was be music at cathedral m le maitre asked if he would sing there very willingly what part would he chose counter tenor immediately began speaking other things before he went church they offered him his part peruse but he did not even look at it this gasconade surprised le maitre you ll see said he whispering me that he does not know single note i replied i am very much afraid him i followed them into church but was extremely uneasy when they began my heart beat violently so much was i interested his behalf i was presently out pain he sung his two recitatives with all imaginable taste judgment what was yet more with very agreeable voice i never enjoyed more pleasing surprise after mass m venture received highest compliments from canons musicians which he answered jokingly though with great grace m le maitre embraced him heartily i did same he saw i was rejoiced at his success appeared pleased at my satisfaction it will easily be surmised that after having been delighted with m bacle who had little attract my admiration i should be infatuated with m venture who had education wit talents knowledge world might be called agreeable rake this was exactly what happened would i believe have happened any other young man my place especially supposing him possessed better judgment distinguish merit more propensity be engaged by it for venture doubtless possessed considerable share one particular very rare at his age namely that never being haste display his talents it is true he boasted many things he did not understand but those he knew which were very numerous he said nothing patiently waiting some occasion display them which he then did with ease though without forwardness thus gave them more effect as there was ever some intermission between proofs his various abilities it was impossible conjecture whether he had ever discovered all his talents playful giddy inexhaustible seducing conversation ever smiling but never laughing repeating rudest things most elegant manner even most modest women were astonished at what they endured from him it was vain for them determine be angry they could not assume appearance it it was extraordinary that with so many agreeable talents country where they are so well understood so much admired he so long remained only musician my attachment m venture more reasonable its cause was also less extravagant its effects though more lively durable than that i had conceived for m bacle i loved see him hear him all his actions appeared charming everything he said was oracle me but enchantment did not extend far enough disable me from quitting him i spoke him with transport madam de warens le maitre likewise spoke his praise she consented we should bring him her house this interview did not succeed he thought her affected she found him libertine alarmed that i had formed such ill acquaintance not only forbade me bringing him there again but likewise painted so strongly danger i ran with this young man that i became little more circumspect giving attachment very happily both for my manners wits we were soon separated m le maitre like most his profession loved good wine at table he was moderate but when busy his closet he must drink his maid was so well acquainted with this humor that no sooner had he prepared his paper compose taken his violoncello than bottle glass arrived was replenished from time time thus without being ever absolutely intoxicated he was usually state elevation this was really unfortunate for he had good heart was so playful that madam de warens used call him kitten unhappily he loved his profession labored much drank proportionately which injured his health at length soured his temper sometimes he was gloomy easily offended though incapable rudeness or giving offence any one for never did he utter harsh word even boys choir on other hand he would not suffer another offend him which was but just misfortune was having little understanding he did not properly discriminate was often angry without cause chapter geneva where so many princes bishops formerly thought it honor be seated though exile it lost its ancient splendor retained without any diminution its pride be admitted you must either be gentleman or doctor sorbonne if there is pardonable pride after that derived from personal merit it is doubtless that arising from birth though general priests having laymen their service treat them with sufficient haughtiness thus canons behaved poor le maitre chanter particular who was called abbe de vidonne other respects well behaved man but too full his nobility did not always show him attention his talents merited m le maitre could not bear these indignities patiently this year during passion week they had more serious dispute than ordinary at institution dinner that bishop gave canons which m maitre was always invited abbe failed some formality adding at same time some harsh words which other could not digest he instantly formed resolution quit them following night nor could any consideration make him give up his design though madam de warens whom he went take leave spared no pains appease him he could not relinquish pleasure leaving his tyrants embarrassed for easter feast at which time he knew they stood greatest need him he was most concerned about his music which he wished take with him but this could not easily be accomplished as it filled large case was very heavy could not be carried under arm madam de warens did what i should have done her situation indeed what i should yet do after many useless efforts retain him seeing he was resolved depart whatever might be event she formed resolution give him every possible assistance i must confess le maitre deserved it her for he was if i may use expression dedicated her service whatever appertained either his art or knowledge readiness with which he obliged gave double value his complaisance thus she only paid back on essential occasion many favors he had been long conferring on her though i should observe she possessed soul that fulfill such duties had no occasion be reminded previous obligations accordingly she ordered me follow le maitre lyons continue with him as long as he might have occasion for my services she has since avowed that desire detaching me from venture had great hand this arrangement she consulted claude anet about conveyance above mentioned case he advised that instead hiring beast at annecy which would infallibly discover us it would be better at night take it some neighboring village there hire ass carry it seyssel which being french dominions we should have nothing fear this plan was adopted we departed same night at seven madam de warens under pretense paying my expenses increased purse poor le maitre by addition that was very acceptable claude anet gardiner myself carried case first village then hired ass same night reached seyssel i think i have already remarked that there are times which i am so unlike myself that i might be taken for man direct opposite disposition i shall now give example this m reydelet curate seyssel was canon st peter s consequently known m le maitre one people from whom he should have taken most pains conceal himself my advice on contrary was present ourselves him under some pretext entreat entertainment as if we visited him by consent chapter le maitre adopted idea which seemed give his revenge appearance satire waggery short we went boldly reydelet who received us very kindly le maitre told him he was going bellay by desire bishop that he might superintend music during easter holidays that he proposed returning that way few days support this tale i told hundred others so naturally that m reydelet thought me very agreeable youth treated me with great friendship civility we were well regaled well lodged m reydelet scarcely knew how make enough us we parted best friends world with promise stop longer on our return we found it difficult refrain from laughter or wait till we were alone give free vent our mirth indeed even now bare recollection it forces smile for never was waggery better or more fortunately maintained this would have made us merry during remainder our journey if m le maitre who did not cease drinking had not been two or three times attacked with complaint that he afterwards became very subject which resembled epilepsy these fits threw me into most fearful embarrassments from which i resolved extricate myself with first opportunity according information given m reydelet we passed our easter holidays at bellay though not expected there were received by music master welcomed by every one with great pleasure m le maitre was considerable note his profession indeed merited that distinction music master bellay who was fond his own works endeavored obtain approbation so good judge for besides being connoisseur m le maitre was equitable neither jealous ill natured critic nor servile flatterer he was so superior generality country music masters they were so sensible it that they treated him rather as their chief than brother musician having passed four or five days very agreeably at bellay we departed continuing our journey without meeting with any accidents except those i have just spoken arrived at lyons were lodged at notre dame de pitie while we waited for arrival before mentioned case which by assistance another lie care our good patron m reydelet we had embarked on rhone m le maitre went visit his acquaintance among others father cato cordelier who will be spoken hereafter abbe dortan count lyons both whom received him well but afterwards betrayed him as will be seen presently indeed his good fortune terminated with m reydelet two days after our arrival at lyons as we passed little street not far from our inn le maitre was attacked by one his fits but it was now so violent as give me utmost alarm i screamed with terror called for help naming our inn entreated some one bear him it then while people were assembled busy round man that had fallen senseless street he was abandoned by only friend on whom he could have any reasonable dependence i seized instant when no one heeded me turned corner street disappeared thanks heaven i have made my third painful confession if many such remained i should certainly abandon work i have undertaken all incidents i have yet related few traces are remaining places where i have lived but what i have relate following book is almost entirely unknown these are greatest extravagancies my life it is happy they had not worse conclusions my head if i may use simile screwed up pitch instrument it did not naturally accord with had lost its diapason time it returned it again when i discontinued my follies or at least gave those more consonant my disposition this epoch my youth i am least able recollect nothing having passed sufficiently interesting influence my heart make me clearly retrace remembrance so many successive changes it is difficult not make some transpositions time or place i write absolutely from memory without notes or materials help my recollection some events are as fresh my idea as if they had recently happened but there are certain chasms which i cannot fill up but by aid recital as confused as remaining traces those which they refer it is possible therefore that i may have erred trifles perhaps shall again but every matter importance i can answer that account is faithfully exact with same veracity reader may depend i shall be careful continue it my resolution was soon taken after quitting le maitre i set out immediately for annecy cause mystery our departure had interested me for security our retreat this interest which entirely employed my thoughts for some days had banished every other idea but no sooner was i secure tranquility than my predominant sentiment regained its place nothing flattered nothing tempted me i had no wish but return madam de warens tenderness truth my attachment her had rooted from my heart every imaginable project all follies ambition i conceived no happiness but living near her nor could i take step without feeling that distance between us was increased i returned therefore as soon as possible with such speed with my spirits such state agitation that though i recall with pleasure all my other travels i have not least recollection this only remembering my leaving lyons reaching annecy let anyone judge whether this last event can have slipped my memory when informed that on my arrival i found madam de warens was not there having set out for paris i was never well informed motives this journey i am certain she would have told me had i asked her but never was man less curious learn secrets his friend my heart is ever so entirely filled with present or with past pleasures which become principal part my enjoyment that there is not chink or corner for curiosity enter all that i conceive from what i heard it is that revolution caused at turin by abdication king sardinia she feared being forgotten was willing by favor intrigues m d aubonne seek same advantage court france where she has often told me she should have preferred it as multiplicity business there prevents your conduct from being so closely inspected if this was her business it is astonishing that on her return she was not ill received be that as it will she continued enjoy her allowance without any interruption many people imagined she was charged with some secret commission either by bishop who then had business at court france where he himself was soon after obliged go or some one yet more powerful who knew how insure her gracious reception at her return if this was case it is certain ambassadress was not ill chosen since being young handsome she had all necessary qualifications succeed negotiation book iv let any one judge my surprise grief at not finding her on my arrival i now felt regret at having abandoned m le maitre my uneasiness increased when i learned misfortunes that had befallen him his box music containing all his fortune that precious box preserved with so much care fatigue had been seized on at lyons by means count dortan who had received information from chapter our having absconded with it vain did le maitre reclaim his property his means existence labor his life his right music question was at least subject litigation but even that liberty was not allowed him affair being instantly decided on principal superior strength thus poor le maitre lost fruit his talents labor his youth principal dependence for support old age nothing was wanting render news i had received truly afflicting but i was at age when even greatest calamities are be sustained accordingly i soon found consolation i expected shortly hear news madam de warens though i was ignorant address she knew nothing my return as my desertion le maitre all things considered i did not find it so very culpable i had been serviceable him at his retreat it was not my power give him any further assistance had i remained with him france it would not have cured his complaint i could not have saved his music should only have doubled his expense this point view i then saw my conduct i see it otherwise now it frequently happens that villainous action does not torment us at instant we commit it but on recollection sometimes even after number years have elapsed for remembrance crimes is not be extinguished only means i had obtain news madam de warens was remain at annecy where should i seek her paris or how bear expense such journey sooner or later there was no place where i could be so certain hear her as that i was now at this consideration determined me remain there though my conduct was very indifferent i did not go bishop who had already befriended me might continue do so my patroness was not present i feared his reprimands on subject our flight neither did i go seminary m gras was no longer there short i went none my acquaintances i should gladly have visited intendant s lady but did not dare i did worse i sought out m venture whom notwithstanding my enthusiasm i had never thought since my departure i found him quite gay high spirits universal favorite ladies annecy this success completed my infatuation i saw nothing but m venture he almost made me forget even madam de warens that i might profit more at ease by his instructions example i proposed share his lodgings which he readily consented it was at shoemaker s pleasant jovial fellow who his county dialect called his wife nothing but trollop appellation which she certainly merited venture took care augment their differences though under appearance doing direct contrary throwing out distant manner provincial accents hints that produced utmost effect furnished such scenes as were sufficient make any one die with laughter thus mornings passed without our thinking them at two or three o clock we took some refreshment venture then went his various engagements where he supped while i walked alone meditating on his great merit coveting admiring his rare talents cursing my own unlucky stars that did not call me so happy life how little did i then know myself mine had been thousand times more delightful had i not been such fool or known better how enjoy it madam de warens had taken no one with her but anet merceret chambermaid whom i have before mentioned still remained house merceret was something older than myself not pretty but tolerably agreeable good natured free from malice having no fault my knowledge but being little refractory with her mistress i often went see her she was old acquaintance who recalled my remembrance one more beloved this made her dear me she had several friends among others one mademoiselle giraud genevese who for punishment my sins took it her head have inclination for me always pressing merceret when she returned her visits bring me with her as i liked merceret i felt no disinclination accompany her besides i met there with some young people whose company pleased me for mademoiselle giraud who offered every kind enticement nothing could increase aversion i had for her when she drew near me with her dried black snout smeared with spanish snuff it was with utmost difficulty that i could refrain from expressing my distaste but being pleased with her visitors i took patience among these were two girls who either pay their court mademoiselle giraud or myself paid me every possible attention i conceived this be only friendship but have since thought it depended only on myself have discovered something more though i did not even think it at time there was another reason for my stupidity seamstresses chambermaids or milliners never tempted me i sighed for ladies every one has his peculiar taste this has ever been mine being this particular different opinion from horace yet it is not vanity riches or rank that attracts me it is well preserved complexion fine hands elegance ornaments air delicacy neatness throughout whole person more taste manner expressing themselves finer or better made gown well turned ankle small foot ribbons lace well dressed hair i even prefer those who have less natural beauty provided they are elegantly decorated i freely confess this preference is very ridiculous yet my heart gives it spite my understanding well even this advantage presented itself it only depended on my own resolution have seized opportunity how do i love from time time return those moments my youth which were so charmingly delightful so short so scarce enjoyed at so cheap rate how fondly do i wish dwell on them even yet remembrance these scenes warms my heart with chaste rapture which appears necessary reanimate my drooping courage enable me sustain weariness my latter days appearance aurora seemed so delightful one morning that putting on my clothes i hastened into country see rising sun i enjoyed that pleasure its utmost extent it was one week after midsummer earth was covered with verdure flowers nightingales whose soft warblings were almost concluded seemed vie with each other concert with birds various kinds bid adieu spring hail approach beautiful summer s day one those lovely days that are no longer be enjoyed at my age which have never been seen on melancholy soil i now inhabit i had rambled insensibly considerable distance from town heat augmented i was walking shade along valley by side brook i heard behind me steps horses voice some females who though they seemed embarrassed did not laugh less heartily on that account i turn round hear myself called by name approaching find two young people my acquaintance mademoiselle de g mademoiselle galley who not being very excellent horsewomen could not make their horses cross rivulet mademoiselle de g was young lady berne very amiable who having been sent from that country for some youthful folly had imitated madam de warens at whose house i had sometimes seen her but not having like her pension she had been fortunate this attachment mademoiselle galley who had prevailed on her mother engage her young friend as companion till she could be otherwise provided for mademoiselle galley was one year younger than her friend handsomer more delicate more ingenious complete all extremely well made they loved each other tenderly good disposition both could not fail render their union durable if some lover did not derange it they informed me they were going toune old castle belonging madam galley implored my assistance make their horses cross stream not being able compass it themselves i would have given each cut or two with whip but they feared i might be kicked themselves thrown i therefore had recourse another expedient i took hold mademoiselle galley s horse led him through brook water reaching half way up my legs other followed without any difficulty this done i would have paid my compliments ladies walked off like great booby as i was but after whispering each other mademoiselle de g said no no you must not think escape thus you have got wet our service we ought conscience take care dry you if you please you must go with us you are now our prisoner my heart began beat i looked at mademoiselle galley yes yes added she laughing at my fearful look our prisoner war come get up behind her we shall give good account you but mademoiselle continued i i have not honor be acquainted with your mother what will she say on my arrival her mother replied mademoiselle de g is not at toune we are alone we shall return at night you shall come back with us stroke electricity has not more instantaneous effect than these words produced on me leaping behind mademoiselle de g i trembled with joy when it became necessary clasp her order hold myself on my heart beat so violently that she perceived it told me hers beat also from fear falling my present posture i might naturally have considered this invitation satisfy myself truth her assertion yet i did not dare during whole way my arm served as girdle very close one i must confess without being moment displaced some women that may read this would be for giving me box on ear truly i deserved it gayety journey chat these girls so enlivened me that during whole time we passed together we never ceased talking moment they had set me so thoroughly at ease that my tongue spoke as fast as my eyes though not exactly same things some minutes indeed when i was left alone with either conversation became little embarrassed but neither them was absent long enough allow time for explaining cause arrived at toune myself well dried we breakfasted together after which it was necessary settle important business preparing dinner young ladies cooked kissing from time time farmer s children while poor scullion looked on grumbling provisions had been sent for from town there was everything necessary for good dinner but unhappily they had forgotten wine this forgetfulness was by no means astonishing girls who seldom drank any but i was sorry for omission as i had reckoned on its help thinking it might add my confidence they were sorry likewise perhaps from same motive though i have no reason say this for their lively charming gayety was innocence itself besides there were two them what could they expect from me they went everywhere about neighborhood seek for wine but none could be procured so pure sober are peasants those parts as they were expressing their concern i begged them not give themselves any uneasiness on my account for while with them i had no occasion for wine intoxicate me this was only gallantry i ventured at during whole day i believe sly rogues saw well enough that i said nothing but truth we dined kitchen two friends were seated on benches one on each side long table their guest at end between them on three legged stool what dinner how charming remembrance while we can enjoy at so small expense such pure such true delights why should we be solicitous for others never did those petite soupes so celebrated paris equal this i do not only say for real pleasure gayety but even for sensuality after dinner we were economical instead drinking coffee we had reserved at breakfast we kept it for afternoon collation with cream some cake they had brought with them keep our appetites play we went into orchard meaning finish our dessert with cherries i got into tree throwing them down bunches from which they returned stones through branches one time mademoiselle galley holding out her apron drawing back her head stood so fair i took such good aim that i dropped bunch into her bosom on her laughing i said myself why are not my lips cherries how gladly would i throw them there likewise thus day passed with greatest freedom yet with utmost decency not single equivocal word not one attempt at double meaning pleasantry yet this delicacy was not affected we only performed parts our hearts dictated short my modesty some will say my folly was such that greatest familiarity that escaped me was once kissing hand mademoiselle galley it is true attending circumstances helped stamp value on this trifling favor we were alone i was embarrassed her eyes were fixed on ground my lips instead uttering words were pressed on her hand which she drew gently back after salute without any appearance displeasure i know not what i should have said her but her friend entered at that moment i thought her ugly at length they bethought themselves that they must return town before night even now we had but just time reach it by daylight we hastened our departure same order we came had i pleased myself i should certainly have reversed this order for glance mademoiselle galley had reached my heart but i dared not mention it proposal could not reasonably come from her on way we expressed our sorrow that day was over but far from complaining shortness its duration we were conscious having prolonged it by every possible amusement i quitted them nearly same spot where i had taken them up with what regret did we part with what pleasure did we form projects renew our meeting delightful hours which we passed innocently together yet were worth ages familiarity sweet remembrance those days cost those amiable girls nothing tender union which reigned among us equalled more lively pleasures with which it could not have existed we loved each other without shame or mystery wished continue our reciprocal affection there is species enjoyment connected with innocence manners which is superior any other because it has no interval for myself remembrance such day touches me nearer delights me more returns with greater rapture my heart than any other pleasure i ever tasted i hardly knew what i wished with those charming girls i do not say that had arrangement been my power i should have divided my heart between them i certainly felt some degree preference though i should have been happy have had mademoiselle de g for mistress i think by choice i should have liked her better as confidante be that as it may i felt on leaving them as though i could not live without either who would have thought that i should never see them more that here our ephemeral amours must end those who read this will not fail laugh at my gallantries remark that after very promising preliminaries my most forward adventures concluded by kiss hand yet be not mistaken reader your estimate my enjoyments i have perhaps tasted more real pleasure my amours which concluded by kiss hand than you will ever have yours which at least begin there venture who had gone bed late night before came soon after me i did not now see him with my usual satisfaction took care not inform him how i had passed day ladies had spoken him slightingly appeared discontented at finding me such bad hands this hurt him my esteem besides whatever diverted my ideas from them was at this time disagreeable however he soon brought me back him myself by speaking situation my affairs which was too critical last for though i spent very little my slender finances were almost exhausted i was without resource no news madam de warens not knowing what would become me feeling cruel pang at heart see friend mademoiselle galley reduced beggary i now learned from venture that he had spoken me judge major would take me next day dine with him that he was man who by means his friends might render me essential service other respects he was desirable acquaintance being man wit letters agreeable conversation one who possessed talents loved them others after this discourse mingling most serious concerns with most trifling frivolity he showed me pretty couplet which came from paris on air one mouret s operas which was then playing monsieur simon judge major was so pleased with this couplet that he determined make another answer it on same air he had desired venture write one he wished me make third that as he expressed it they might see couplets start up next day like incidents comic romance night not being able sleep i composed couplet as my first essay poetry it was passable better or at least composed with more taste than it would have been preceding night subject being tenderness which my heart was now entirely disposed morning i showed my performance venture who being pleased with couplet put it his pocket without informing me whether he had made his we dined with m simon who treated us very politely conversation was agreeable indeed it could not be otherwise between two men natural good sense improved by reading for me i acted my proper part which was listen without attempting join conversation neither them mentioned couplet nor do i know that it ever passed for mine m simon appeared satisfied with my behavior indeed it was almost all he saw me at this interview we had often met at madam de warens but he had never paid much attention me it is from this dinner therefore that i date our acquaintance which though no use regard object i then had view was afterwards productive advantages which make me recollect it with pleasure i should be wrong not give some account this person since from his office magistrate reputation wit on which he piqued himself no idea could be formed it judge major simon certainly was not two feet high his legs spare straight tolerably long would have added something his stature had they been vertical but they stood direction open pair compasses his body was not only short but thin being every respect most inconceivable smallness when naked he must have appeared like grasshopper his head was common size which appertained well formed face noble look tolerably fine eyes short it appeared borrowed head stuck on miserable stump he might very well have dispensed with dress for his large wig alone covered him from head foot he had two voices perfectly different which intermingled perpetually his conversation forming at first diverting but afterwards very disagreeable contrast one grave sonorous was if i may hazard expression voice his head other clear sharp piercing voice his body when he paid particular attention spoke leisurely so as preserve his breath he could continue his deep tone but if he was least animated or attempted lively accent his voice sounded like whistling key it was with utmost difficulty that he could return bass with figure i have just described which is by no means overcharged m simon was gallant ever entertaining ladies with soft tales carrying decoration his person even foppery willing make use every advantage he during morning gave audience bed for when handsome head was discovered on pillow no one could have imagined what belonged it this circumstance gave birth scenes which i am certain are yet remembered by all annecy one morning when he expected give audience bed or rather on bed having on handsome night cap ornamented with rose colored ribbon countryman arriving knocked at door maid happened be out judge therefore hearing knock repeated cried come as he spoke rather loud it was his shrill tone man entered looked about endeavoring discover whence female voice proceeded at length seeing handsome head dress set off with ribbons was about leave room making supposed lady hundred apologies m simon rage screamed more countryman yet more confirmed his opinion conceiving himself be insulted began railing his turn saying that apparently she was nothing better than common streetwalker that judge major should be ashamed setting such ill examples enraged magistrate having no other weapon than jordan under his bed was just going throw it at poor fellow s head as his servant returned this dwarf ill used by nature as his person was recompensed by possessing understanding naturally agreeable which he had been careful cultivate though he was esteemed good lawyer he did not like his profession delighting more finer parts literature which he studied with success above all he possessed that superficial brilliancy art pleasing conversation even with ladies he knew by heart number little stories which he perfectly well knew how make most relating with air secrecy as anecdote yesterday what happened sixty years before he understood music could sing agreeably short for magistrate he had many pleasing talents by flattering ladies annecy he became fashionable among them appearing continually their train he even pretended favors at which they were much amused madam d epigny used say greatest favor he could aspire was kiss lady on her knees as he was well read spoke fluently his conversation was both amusing instructive when i afterwards took taste for study i cultivated his acquaintance found my account it when at chambery i frequently went from thence see him his praises increased my emulation which he added some good advice respecting prosecution my studies which i found useful unhappily this weakly body contained very feeling soul some years after he was chagrined by i know not what unlucky affair but it cost him his life this was really unfortunate for he was good little man whom at first acquaintance one laughed at but afterwards loved though our situations life were very little connected with each other as i received some useful lessons from him i thought gratitude demanded that i should dedicate few sentences his memory as soon as i found myself at liberty i ran into street where mademoiselle galley lived flattering myself that i should see someone go or out or at least open window but i was mistaken not even cat appeared house remaining as close all time as if it had been uninhabited street was small lonely any one loitering about was consequently more likely be noticed from time time people passed out neighborhood i was much embarrassed thinking my person might be known cause that brought me there conjectured this idea tortured me for i have ever preferred honor happiness those i love my own pleasures at length weary playing spanish lover having no guitar i determined write mademoiselle de g i should have preferred writing her friend but did not dare take that liberty as it appeared more proper begin with her whom i owed acquaintance with whom i was most familiar having written my letter i took it mademoiselle giraud as young ladies had agreed at parting they having furnished me with this expedient mademoiselle giraud was quilter sometimes worked at madam galley s which procured her free admission house i must confess i was not thoroughly satisfied with this messenger but was cautious starting difficulties fearing that if i objected her no other might be named it was impossible intimate that she had inclination me herself i even felt humiliated that she should think i could imagine her same sex as those young ladies word i accepted her agency rather than none availed myself it at all events at very first word giraud discovered me i must own this was not difficult matter for if sending letter young girls had not spoken sufficiently plain my foolish embarrassed air would have betrayed me it will easily be supposed that employment gave her little satisfaction she undertook it however performed it faithfully next morning i ran her house found answer ready for me how did i hurry away that i might have opportunity read kiss it alone though this need not been told but plan adopted by mademoiselle giraud which i found more delicacy moderation than i had expected should she had sense enough conclude that her thirty seven years hare s eyes daubed nose shrill voice black skin stood no chance against two elegant young girls all height bloom beauty she resolved therefore nether betray nor assist them choosing rather lose me entirely than entertain me for them as merceret had not heard from her mistress for some time she thought returning fribourg persuasions giraud determined her nay more she intimated it was proper someone should conduct her her father s proposed me as i happened be agreeable little merceret she approved idea same day they mentioned it me as fixed point finding nothing displeasing manner they had disposed me i consented thinking it could not be above week s journey at most but giraud who had arranged whole affair thought otherwise it was necessary avow state my finances conclusion was that merceret should defray my expenses but retrench on one hand what was expended on other i advised that her little baggage should be sent on before that we should proceed by easy journeys on foot i am sorry have so many girls love with me but as there is nothing be very vain success these amours i think i may tell truth without scruple merceret younger less artful than giraud never made me so many advances but she imitated my manners my actions repeated my words showed me all those little attentions i ought have had for her being very timorous she took great care that we should both sleep same chamber circumstance that usually produces some consequences between lad twenty girl twenty five for once however it went no further my simplicity being such that though merceret was by no means disagreeable girl idea gallantry never entered my head even if it had i was too great novice have profited by it i could not imagine how two young persons could bring themselves sleep together thinking that such familiarity must require age preparation if poor merceret paid my expenses hopes any return she was terribly cheated for we arrived at fribourg exactly as we had quitted annecy i passed through geneva without visiting any one while going over bridges i found myself so affected that i could scarcely proceed never could i see walls that city never could i enter it without feeling my heart sink from excess tenderness at same time that image liberty elevated my soul ideas equality union gentleness manners touched me even tears inspired me with lively regret at having forfeited all these advantages what error was i but yet how natural i imagined i saw all this my native country because i bore it my heart it was necessary pass through nion could i do this without seeing my good father had i resolved on doing so i must afterwards have died with regret i left merceret at inn ventured his house how wrong was i fear him on seeing me his soul gave way parental tenderness with which it was filled what tears were mingled with our embraces he thought i was returned him i related my history informed him my resolution he opposed it feebly mentioning dangers which i exposed myself telling me shortest follies were best but did not attempt keep me by force which particular i think he acted right but it is certain he did not do everything his power detain me even by fair means whether after step i had taken he thought i ought not return or was puzzled at my age know what do with me i have since found that he conceived very unjust opinion my travelling companion my step mother good woman little coaxingly put on appearance wishing me stay supper i did not however comply but told them i proposed remaining longer with them on my return leaving as deposit my little packet that had come by water would have been incumbrance had i taken it with me i continued my journey next morning well satisfied that i had seen my father had taken courage do my duty we arrived without any accident at fribourg towards conclusion journey politeness mademoiselle merceret rather diminished after our arrival she treated me even with coldness her father who was not best circumstances did not show me much attention i was obliged lodge at alehouse i went see them next morning received invitation dine there which i accepted we separated without tears at night i returned my paltry lodging departed second day after my arrival almost without knowing whither go this was circumstance my life which providence offered me precisely what was necessary make my days pass happily merceret was good girl neither witty handsome nor ugly not very lively but tolerably rational except while under influence some little humors which usually evaporated tears without any violent outbreak temper she had real inclination for me i might have married her without difficulty followed her father s business my taste for music would have made me love her i should have settled at fribourg small town not pretty but inhabited by very worthy people i should certainly have missed great pleasures but should have lived peace my last hour i must know best what i should have gained by such step i did not return nion but lausanne wishing gratify myself with view that beautiful lake which is seen there its utmost extent greater part my secret motives have not been so reasonable distant expectation has rarely strength enough influence my actions uncertainty future ever making me regard projects whose execution requires length time as deceitful lures i give visionary scenes hope as well as others provided they cost nothing but if attended with any trouble i have done with them smallest most trifling pleasure that is conveniently within my reach tempts me more than all joys paradise i must except however those pleasures which are necessarily followed by pain i only love those enjoyments which are unadulterated which can never be case where we are conscious they must be followed by repentance it was necessary i should arrive at some place nearest was best for having lost my way on road i found myself evening at moudon where i spent all that remained my little stock except ten creuzers which served purchase my next day s dinner arriving evening at lausanne i went into ale house without penny my pocket pay for my lodging or knowing what would become me i found myself extremely hungry setting therefore good face on matter i ordered supper made my meal went bed without thought slept with great composure morning having breakfasted reckoned with my host i offered leave my waistcoat pledge for seven batz which was amount my expenses honest man refused this saying thank heaven he had never stripped any one would not now begin for seven batz adding i should keep my waistcoat pay him when i could i was affected with this unexpected kindness but felt it less than i ought have done or have since experienced on remembrance it i did not fail sending him his money with thanks by one i could depend on fifteen years after passing lausanne on my return from italy i felt sensible regret at having forgotten name landlord house i wished see him should have felt real pleasure recalling his memory that worthy action services which doubtless have been much more important but rendered with ostentation have not appeared me so worthy gratitude as simple unaffected humanity this honest man as i approached lausanne i thought my distress means extricating myself without appearing want my step mother i compared myself this walking pilgrimage my friend venture on his arrival at annecy was so warmed with idea that without recollecting that i had neither his gentility nor his talents i determined act part little venture at lausanne teach music which i did not understand say i came from paris where i had never been consequence this noble project as there was no company where i could introduce myself without expense not choosing venture among professional people i inquired for some little inn where i could lodge cheap was directed one named perrotet who took boarders this perrotet who was one best men world received me very kindly after having heard my feigned story profession promised speak me endeavored procure me scholars saying he should not expect any money till i had earned it his price for board though moderate itself was great deal me he advised me therefore begin with half board which consisted good soup only for dinner but plentiful supper at night i closed with this proposition poor perrotet trusted me with great cheerfulness sparing meantime no trouble be useful me having found so many good people my youth why do i find so few my age is their race extinct no but i do not seek them same situation i did formerly among commonality where violent passions predominate only at intervals where nature speaks her genuine sentiments more elevated stations they are entirely smothered under mask sentiment only interest or vanity is heard having written my father from lausanne he sent my packet some excellent advice which i should have profited better i have already observed that i have moments inconceivable delirium which i am entirely out myself adventure i am about relate is instance this comprehend how completely my brain was turned what degree i had venturised if i may be allowed expression many extravagances i ran into at same time should be considered behold me then singing master without knowing how note common song for if five or six months passed with le maitre had improved me they could not be supposed sufficient qualify me for such undertaking besides being taught by master was enough as i have before observed make me learn ill being parisian from geneva catholic protestant country i thought i should change my name with my religion country still approaching as near as possible great model i had view he called himself venture de villeneuve i changed by anagram name rousseau into that vaussore calling myself monsieur vaussore de villeneuve venture was good composer though he had not said so without knowing anything art i boasted my skill every one this was not all being presented monsieur de freytorens professor law who loved music who gave concerts at his house nothing would do but i must give him proof my talents accordingly i set about composing piece for his concerts as boldly as if i had really understood science i had constancy labor fortnight at this curious business copy it fair write out different parts distribute them with as much assurance as if they had been masterpieces harmony short what will hardly be believed though strictly true i tacked very pretty minuet end it that was commonly played about streets which many may remember from these words so well known at that time quel caprice quelle injustice quoi ta clarice trahirait tes feux c venture had taught me this air with bass set other words by help which i had retained it thus at end my composition i put this minuet bass suppressing words uttering it for my own as confidently as if i had been speaking inhabitants moon they assembled perform my piece i explain each movement taste execution references his part i was fully occupied they were five or six minutes preparing which were for me so many ages at length everything is adjusted myself conspicuous situation fine roll paper my hand gravely preparing beat time i gave four or five strokes with my paper attending with take care they begin no never since french operas existed was there such confused discord minuet however presently put all company good humor hardly was it begun before i heard bursts laughter from all parts every one congratulated me on my pretty taste for music declaring this minuet would make me spoken that i merited loudest praise it is not necessary describe my uneasiness or own how much i deserved it next day one musicians named lutold came see me was kind enough congratulate me on my success profound conviction my folly shame regret state despair which i was reduced with impossibility concealing cruel agitation my heart made me open it him giving therefore loose my tears not content with owning my ignorance i told all conjuring him secrecy he kept his word as every one will suppose same evening all lausanne knew who i was but what is remarkable no one seemed know not even good perrotet who notwithstanding what had happened continued lodge board me i led melancholy life here consequences such essay had not rendered lausanne very agreeable residence scholars did not present themselves crowds not single female not person city i had only two or three great dunces as stupid as i was ignorant who fatigued me death my hands were not likely edify much at length i was sent for house where little serpent girl amused herself by showing me parcel music that i could not read note which she had malice sing before her master teach him how it should be executed for i was so unable read air at first sight that charming concert i have just described i could not possibly follow execution moment or know whether they played truly what lay before them i myself had composed midst so many humiliating circumstances i had pleasing consolation from time time receiving letters from my two charming friends i have ever found utmost consolatory virtue fair when disgrace nothing softens my affliction more than be sensible that amiable woman is interested for me this correspondence ceased soon after was never renewed indeed it was my own fault for changing situations i neglected sending my address forced by necessity think perpetually myself i soon forgot them it is long time since i mentioned madam de warens but it should not be supposed i had forgotten her never was she moment absent from my thoughts i anxiously wished find her not merely because she was necessary my subsistence but because she was infinitely more necessary my heart my attachment her though lively tender as it really was did not prevent my loving others but then it was not same manner all equally claimed my tenderness for their charms but it was those charms alone i loved my passion would not have survived them while madam de warens might have become old or ugly without my loving her less tenderly my heart had entirely transmitted herself homage it first paid her beauty whatever change she might experience while she remained herself my sentiments could not change i was sensible how much gratitude i owed her but truth i never thought it whether she served me or not it would ever have been same thing i loved her neither from duty interest nor convenience i loved her because i was born love her during my attachment another i own this affection was some measure deranged i did not think so frequently her but still with same pleasure never love or otherwise did i think her without feeling that i could expect no true happiness life while state separation though so long time i had received no news from madam de warens i never imagined i had entirely lost her or that she could have forgotten me i said myself she will know sooner or later that i am wandering about will find some means inform me her situation i am certain i shall find her meantime it was pleasure live her native country walk streets where she had walked before houses that she had lived yet all this was work conjecture for one my foolish peculiarities was not daring inquire after her or even pronounce her name without most absolute necessity it seemed speaking her that i declared all i felt that my lips revealed secrets my heart some degree injured object my affection i believe fear was likewise mingled with this idea i dreaded hear ill her her management had been much spoken some little her conduct other respects fearing therefore that something might be said which i did not wish hear i preferred being silent on subject as my scholars did not take up much my time town where she was born was not above four leagues from lausanne i made it walk three or four days during which time most pleasant emotion never left me view lake geneva its admirable banks had ever my idea particular attraction which i cannot describe not arising merely from beauty prospect but something else i know not why more interesting which affects softens me every time i have approached vaudois country i have experienced impression composed remembrance madam de warens who was born there my father who lived there miss vulson who had been my first love several pleasant journeys i had made there my childhood mingled with some nameless charm more powerfully attractive than all rest when that ardent desire for life happiness tranquility which ever follows me for which i was born inflames my mind tis ever country vaud near lake those charming plains that imagination leads me orchard on banks that lake no other is absolutely necessary firm friend amiable woman cow little boat nor could i enjoy perfect happiness on earth without these concomitants i laugh at simplicity with which i have several times gone into that country for sole purpose seeking this imaginary happiness when i was ever surprised find inhabitants particularly women quite different disposition what i sought how strange did this appear me country people who inhabit it were never my idea formed for each other walking along these beautiful banks on my way vevay i gave myself up soft melancholy my heart rushed with ardor into thousand innocent felicities melting tenderness i sighed wept like child how often stopping weep more at my ease seated on large stone did i amuse myself with seeing my tears drop into water on my arrival at vevay i lodged at key during two days i remained there without any acquaintance conceived love for that city which has followed me through all my travels was finally cause that i fixed on this spot novel i afterwards wrote for residence my hero heroines i would say any one who has taste feeling go vevay visit surrounding country examine prospects go on lake then say whether nature has not designed this country for julia clara st preux but do not seek them there i now return my story giving myself out for catholic i followed without mystery or scruple religion i had embraced on sunday if weather was fine i went hear mass at assans place two leagues distant from lausanne generally company with other catholics particularly parisian embroiderer whose name i have forgotten not such parisian as myself but real native paris arch parisian from his maker yet honest as peasant he loved his country so well that he would not doubt my being his countryman for fear he should not have so much occasion speak it lieutenant governor m de crouzas had gardener who was likewise from paris but not so complaisant he thought glory his country concerned when any one claimed that honor who was not really entitled it he put questions me therefore with air tone as if certain detect me falsehood once smiling malignantly asked what was remarkable marcheneuf it may be supposed i asked question but i have since passed twenty years at paris certainly know that city yet was same question repeated at this day i should be equally embarrassed answer it from this embarrassment it might be concluded i had never been there thus even when we meet with truths we are subject build our opinions on circumstances which may easily deceive us i formed no ideas while at lausanne that were worth recollecting nor can i say exactly how long i remained there i only know that not finding sufficient subsist on i went from thence neuchatel where i passed winter here i succeeded better i got some scholars saved enough pay my good friend perrotet who had faithfully sent my baggage though at that time i was considerably his debt by continuing teach music i insensibly gained some knowledge it life i led was sufficiently agreeable any reasonable man might have been satisfied but my unsettled heart demanded something more on sundays or whenever i had leisure i wandered sighing thoughtful about adjoining woods when once out city never returned before night one day being at boudry i went dine at public house where i saw man with long beard dressed violet colored grecian habit with fur cap whose air manner were rather noble this person found some difficulty making himself understood speaking only unintelligible jargon which bore more resemblance italian than any other language i understood almost all he said i was only person present who could do so for he was obliged make his request known landlord others about him by signs on my speaking few words italian which he perfectly understood he got up embraced me with rapture connection was soon formed from that moment i became his interpreter his dinner was excellent mine rather worse than indifferent he gave me invitation dine with him which i accepted without much ceremony drinking chatting soon rendered us familiar by end repast we had all disposition world become inseparable companions he informed me he was greek prelate archimandrite jerusalem that he had undertaken make gathering europe for reestablishment holy sepulchre showed me some very fine patents from czarina emperor several other sovereigns he was tolerably content with what he had collected hitherto though he had experienced inconceivable difficulties germany for not understanding word german latin or french he had been obliged have recourse his greek turkish lingua franca which did not procure him much country he was travelling through his proposal therefore me was that i should accompany him quality secretary interpreter spite my violet colored coat which accorded well enough with proposed employment he guessed from my meagre appearance that i should easily be gained he was not mistaken bargain was soon made i demanded nothing he promised liberally thus without any security or knowledge person i was about serve i gave myself up entirely his conduct next day behold me on expedition jerusalem we began our expedition unsuccessfully by canton fribourg episcopal dignity would not suffer him play beggar or solicit help from private individuals but we presented his commission senate who gave him trifling sum from thence we went berne where we lodged at falcon then good inn frequented by respectable company public table being well supplied numerously attended i had fared indifferently so long that i was glad make myself amends therefore took care profit by present occasion my lord archimandrite was himself excellent companion loved good cheer was gay spoke well for those who understood him knew perfectly well how make most his grecian erudition one day at dessert while cracking nuts he cut his finger pretty deeply as it bled freely showed it company saying with laugh mirate signori questo sangue pelasgo at berne i was not useless him nor was my performance so bad as i had feared i certainly spoke better with more confidence than i could have done for myself matters were not conducted here with same simplicity as at fribourg long frequent conferences were necessary with premiers state examination his titles was not work day at length everything being adjusted he was admitted audience by senate i entered with him as interpreter was ordered speak i expected nothing less for it never entered my mind that after such long frequent conferences with members it was necessary address assembly collectively as if nothing had been said judge my embarrassment man so bashful speak not only public but before whole senate berne speak impromptu without single moment for recollection it was enough annihilate me i was not even intimidated i described distinctly clearly commission archimandrite extolled piety those princes who had contributed heighten that their excellencies by emulation added that less could not be expected from their well known munificence then endeavoring prove that this good work was equally interesting all christians without distinction sect concluded by promising benediction heaven all those who took part it i will not say that my discourse was cause our success but it was certainly well received on our quitting archimandrite was gratified by very genteel present which some very handsome compliments were added on understanding his secretary these i had agreeable office interpreting but could not take courage render them literally this was only time my life that i spoke public before sovereign only time perhaps that i spoke boldly well what difference disposition same person three years ago having been see my old friend m roguin at yverdon i received deputation thank me for some books i had presented library that city swiss are great speakers these gentlemen accordingly made me long harangue which i thought myself obliged honor answer but so embarrassed myself attempt that my head became confused i stopped short was laughed at though naturally timid i have sometimes acted with confidence my youth but never my advanced age more i have seen world less i have been able adapt its manners on leaving berne we went soleurre archimandrite designing re enter germany return through hungary or poland his own country this would have been prodigious tour but as contents his purse rather increased than diminished during his journey he was no haste return for me who was almost as much pleased on horseback as on foot i would have desired no better than have travelled thus during my whole life but it was pre ordained that my journey should soon end first thing we did after our arrival at soleurre was pay our respects french ambassador there unfortunately for my bishop this chanced be marquis de bonac who had been ambassador at porte was acquainted with every particular relative holy sepulchre archimandrite had audience that lasted about quarter hour which i was not admitted as ambassador spoke french italian at least as well as myself on my grecian s retiring i was prepared follow him but was detained it was now my turn having called myself parisian as such i was under jurisdiction his excellency he therefore asked me who i was exhorting me tell truth this i promised do but entreated private audience which was immediately granted ambassador took me his closet shut door there throwing myself at his feet i kept my word nor should i have said less had i promised nothing for continual wish unbosom myself puts my heart perpetually upon my lips after having disclosed myself without reserve musician lutold there was no occasion attempt acting mysterious with marquis de bonac who was so well pleased with my little history ingenuousness with which i had related it that he led me ambassadress presented me with abridgment my recital madam de bonac received me kindly saying i must not be suffered follow that greek monk it was accordingly resolved that i should remain at their hotel till something better could be done for me i wished bid adieu my poor archimandrite for whom i had conceived attachment but was not permitted they sent him word that i was be detained there quarter hour after i saw my little bundle arrive m de la martiniere secretary embassy had manner care me while following him chamber appropriated my use he said this apartment was occupied under count de luc by celebrated man same name as yourself it is your power succeed him every respect cause it be said hereafter rousseau first rousseau second this similarity which i did not then expect would have been less flattering my wishes could i have foreseen at what price i should one day purchase distinction what m de la martiniere had said excited my curiosity i read works person whose chamber i occupied on strength compliment that had been paid me imagining i had taste for poetry made my first essay cantata praise madam de bonac this inclination was not permanent though from time time i have composed tolerable verses i think it is good exercise teach elegant turns expression write well prose but could never find attractions enough french poetry give entirely it m de la martiniere wished see my style asked me write detail i had before made ambassador accordingly i wrote him long letter which i have since been informed was preserved by m de marianne who had long been attached marquis de bonac has since succeeded m de martiniere as secretary embassy m de courtellies experience i began acquire tended moderate my romantic projects for example i did not fall love with madam de bonac but also felt i did not stand much chance succeeding service her husband m de la martiniere was already only place that could have satisfied my ambition m de marianne expectancy thus my utmost hopes could only aspire office under secretary which did not infinitely tempt me this was reason that when consulted on situation i should like be placed i expressed great desire go paris ambassador readily gave idea which at least tended disembarrass him me m de merveilleux interpreting secretary embassy said that his friend m godard swiss colonel service france wanted person be with his nephew who had entered very young into service made no doubt that i should suit him on this idea so lightly formed my departure was determined i who saw long journey perform with paris at end it was enraptured with project they gave me several letters hundred livres defray expenses my journey accompanied with some good advice thus equipped i departed i was fortnight making journey which i may reckon among happiest days my life i was young perfect health with plenty money most brilliant hopes add this i was on foot alone it may appear strange i should mention latter circumstance as advantageous if my peculiarity temper is not already familiar reader i was continually occupied with variety pleasing chimeras never did warmth my imagination produce more magnificent ones when offered empty place carriage or any person accosted me on road how vexed was i see that fortune overthrown whose edifice while walking i had taken such pains rear for once my ideas were all martial i was going live with military man nay become one for it was concluded i should begin with being cadet i already fancied myself regimentals with fine white feather nodding on my hat my heart was inflamed by noble idea i had some smattering geometry fortification my uncle was engineer i was manner soldier by inheritance my short sight indeed presented some little obstacle but did not by any means discourage me as i reckoned supply that defect by coolness intrepidity i had read too that marshal schomberg was remarkably shortsighted why might not marshal rousseau be same my imagination was so warm by these follies that it presented nothing but troops ramparts gabions batteries myself midst fire smoke eyeglass hand commanding with utmost tranquility notwithstanding when country presented delightful prospect when i saw charming groves rivulets pleasing sight made me sigh with regret feel midst all this glory that my heart was not formed for such havoc soon without knowing how i found my thoughts wandering among my dear sheep folds renouncing forever labor mars how much did paris disappoint idea i had formed it exterior decorations i had seen at turin beauty streets symmetry regularity houses contributed this disappointment since i concluded that paris must be infinitely superior i had figured myself splendid city beautiful as large most commanding aspect whose streets were ranges magnificent palaces composed marble gold on entering faubourg st marceau i saw nothing but dirty stinking streets filthy black houses air slovenliness poverty beggars carters butchers cries tisane old hats this struck me so forcibly that all i have since seen real magnificence paris could never erase this first impression which has ever given me particular disgust residing that capital i may say whole time i remained there afterwards was employed seeking resources which might enable me live at distance from it this is consequence too lively imagination which exaggerates even beyond voice fame ever expects more than is told i have heard paris so flatteringly described that i pictured it like ancient babylon which perhaps had i seen i might have found equally faulty unlike that idea account had conveyed same thing happened at opera house which i hastened day after my arrival i was sensible same deficiency at versailles some time after on viewing sea i am convinced this would ever be consequence too flattering description any object for it is impossible for man difficult even for nature herself surpass riches my imagination by reception i met with from all those whom my letters were addressed i thought my fortune was certainly made person who received me least kindly was m de surbeck whom i had warmest recommendation he had retired from service lived philosophically at bagneux where i waited on him several times without his offering me even glass water i was better received by madam de merveilleux sister law interpreter by his nephew who was officer guards mother son not only received me kindly but offered me use their table which favor i frequently accepted during my stay at paris madam de merveilleux appeared have been handsome her hair was fine black which according old mode she wore curled on temples she still retained what do not perish with set features beauties amiable mind she appeared satisfied with mine did all she could render me service but no one seconded her endeavors i was presently undeceived great interest they had seemed take my affairs i must however do french nation justice say they do not so exhaust themselves with protestations as some have represented that those they make are usually sincere but they have manner appearing interested your affairs which is more deceiving than words gross compliments swiss can only impose upon fools manners french are more seducing at same time so simple that you are persuaded they do not express all they mean do for you order that you may be more agreeably surprised i will say more they are not false their protestations being naturally zealous oblige humane benevolent even whatever may be said contrary more sincere than any other nation but they are too flighty effect they feel sentiments they profess for you but that sentiment flies off as instantaneously as it was formed speaking you their whole attention is employed on you alone when absent you are forgotten nothing is permanent their hearts all is work moment thus i was greatly flattered but received little service colonel godard for whose nephew i was recommended proved be avaricious old wretch who on seeing my distress though he was immensely rich wished have my services for nothing meaning place me with his nephew rather as valet without wages than tutor he represented that as i was be continually engaged with him i should be excused from duty might live on my cadet s allowance that is say on pay soldier hardly would he consent give me uniform thinking clothing army might serve madam de merveilleux provoked at his proposals persuaded me not accept them her son was same opinion something else was be thought on but no situation was procured meantime i began be necessitated for hundred livres with which i had commenced my journey could not last much longer happily i received small remittance from ambassador which was very serviceable nor do i think he would have abandoned me had i possessed more patience but languishing waiting soliciting are me impossible i was disheartened displeased thus all my brilliant expectations came once more nothing i had not all this time forgotten my dear madam de warens but how was i find her where should i seek her madam de merveilleux who knew my story assisted me search but for long time unavailingly at length she informed me that madam de warens had set out from paris about two months before but it was not known whether for savoy or turin that some conjectured she was gone switzerland nothing further was necessary fix my determination follow her certain that wherever she might be i stood more chance finding her at those places than i could possibly do at paris before my departure i exercised my new poetical talent epistle colonel godard whom i ridiculed utmost my abilities i showed this scribble madam de merveilleux who instead discouraging me as she ought have done laughed heartily at my sarcasms as well as her son who i believe did not like m godard indeed it must be confessed he was man not calculated obtain affection i was tempted send him my verses they encouraged me it accordingly i made them up parcel directed him there being no post then at paris by which i could conveniently send this i put it my pocket sent it him from auxerre as i passed through that place i laugh even yet sometimes at grimaces i fancy he made on reading this panegyric where he was certainly drawn life it began thus tu croyois vieux penard qu une folle manie d elever ton neveu m inspireroit l envie this little piece which it is true was but indifferently written did not want for salt announced turn for satire it is notwithstanding only satirical writing that ever came from my pen i have too little hatred my heart take advantage such talent but i believe it may be judged from those controversies which from time time i have been engaged my own defence that had i been vindictive disposition my adversaries would rarely have had laughter on their side what i most regret is not having kept journal my travels being conscious that number interesting details have slipped my memory for never did i exist so completely never live so thoroughly never was so much myself if i dare use expression as those journeys made on foot walking animates enlivens my spirits i can hardly think when state inactivity my body must be exercised make my judgment active view fine country succession agreeable prospects free air good appetite health i gained by walking freedom inns distance from everything that can make me recollect dependence my situation conspire free my soul give boldness my thoughts throwing me manner into immensity beings where i combine choose appropriate them my fancy without constraint or fear i dispose all nature as i please my heart wandering from object object approximates unites with those that please it is surrounded by charming images becomes intoxicated with delicious sensations if attempting render these permanent i am amused describing myself what glow coloring what energy expression do i give them it has been said that all these are be found my works though written decline life oh had those my early youth been seen those made during my travels composed but never written why did i not write them will be asked why should i have written them i may answer why deprive myself actual charm my enjoyments inform others what i enjoyed what me were readers public or all world while i was mounting empyrean besides did i carry pens paper ink with me had i recollected all these not thought would have occurred worth preserving i do not foresee when i shall have ideas they come when they please not when i call for them either they avoid me altogether or rushing crowds overwhelm me with their force number ten volumes day would not suffice barely enumerate my thoughts how then should i find time write them stopping i thought nothing but hearty dinner on departing nothing but charming walk i felt that new paradise awaited me at door eagerly leaped forward enjoy it never did i experience this so feelingly as perambulation i am now describing on coming paris i had confined myself ideas which related situation i expected occupy there i had rushed into career i was about run should have completed it with tolerable eclat but it was not that my heart adhered some real beings obscured my imagined ones colonel godard his nephew could not keep pace with hero my disposition thank heaven i was soon delivered from all these obstacles could enter at pleasure into wilderness chimeras for that alone remained before me i wandered it so completely that i several times lost my way but this was no misfortune i would not have shortened it for feeling with regret as i approached lyons that i must again return material world i should have been glad never have arrived there one day among others having purposely gone out my way take nearer view spot that appeared delightful i was so charmed with it wandered round it so often that at length i completely lost myself after several hours useless walking weary fainting with hunger thirst i entered peasant s hut which had not indeed very promising appearance but was only one i could discover near me i thought it was here as at geneva or switzerland where inhabitants living at ease have it their power exercise hospitality i entreated countryman give me some dinner offering pay for it on which he presented me with some skimmed milk coarse barley bread saying it was all he had i drank milk with pleasure ate bread chaff all but it was not very restorative man sinking with fatigue countryman who watched me narrowly judged truth my story by my appetite presently after having said that he plainly saw i was honest good natured young man did not come betray him opened little trap door by side his kitchen went down returned moment after with good brown loaf pure wheat remains well flavored ham bottle wine sight which rejoiced my heart more than all rest he then prepared good thick omelet i made such dinner as none but walking traveller ever enjoyed when i again offered pay his inquietude fears returned he not only would have no money but refused it with most evident emotion what made this scene more amusing i could not imagine motive his fear at length he pronounced tremblingly those terrible words commissioners cellar rats which he explained by giving me understand that he concealed his wine because excise his bread on account tax imposed on it adding he should be undone man if it was suspected he was not almost perishing with want what he said me on this subject which i had not smallest idea made impression on my mind that can never be effaced sowing seeds that inextinguishable hatred which has since grown up my heart against vexations these unhappy people suffer against their oppressors this man though easy circumstances dare not eat bread gained by sweat his brow could only escape destruction by exhibiting outward appearance misery i left his cottage with as much indignation as concern deploring fate those beautiful countries where nature has been prodigal her gifts only that they may become prey barbarous exactors incident which i have just related is only one i have distinct remembrance during this journey i recollect indeed that on approaching lyons i wished prolong it by going see banks lignon for among romances i had read with my father astrea was not forgotten returned more frequently my thoughts than any other stopping for some refreshment while chatting with my hostess i inquired way forez was informed that country was excellent place for mechanics as there were many forges much iron work done there this eulogium instantly calmed my romantic curiosity for i felt no inclination seek dianas sylvanders among generation blacksmiths good woman who encouraged me with this piece information certainly thought i was journeyman locksmith i had some view going lyons on my arrival i went chasattes see mademoiselle du chatelet friend madam de warens for whom i had brought letter when i came there with m le maitre so that it was acquaintance already formed mademoiselle du chatelet informed me her friend had passed through lyons but could not tell whether she had gone on piedmont being uncertain at her departure whether it would not be necessary stop savoy but if i choose she would immediately write for information thought my best plan would be remain at lyons till she received it i accepted this offer but did not tell mademoiselle du chatelet how much i was pressed for answer that my exhausted purse would not permit me wait long it was not appearance coolness that withheld me on contrary i was very kindly received treated on footing equality this took from me resolution explaining my circumstances for i could not bear descend from companion miserable beggar i seem have retained very connecting remembrance that part my life contained this book yet i think i remember about same period another journey lyons particulars which i cannot recollect where i found myself much straitened confused remembrance extremities which i was reduced does not contribute recall idea agreeably had i been like many others had i possessed talent borrowing running debt at every ale house i came i might have fared better but that my incapacity equalled my repugnance demonstrate prevalence both it will be sufficient say that though i have passed almost my whole life indifferent circumstances frequently have been near wanting bread i was never once asked for money by creditor without having it my power pay it instantly i could never bear contract clamorous debts have ever preferred suffering owing being reduced pass my nights streets may certainly be called suffering this was several times case at lyons having preferred buying bread with few pence i had remaining bestowing them on lodging as i was convinced there was less danger dying for want sleep than hunger what is astonishing while this unhappy situation i took no care for future was neither uneasy nor melancholy but patiently waited answer mademoiselle du chatelet s letter lying open air stretched on earth or on bench slept as soundly as if reposing on bed roses i remember particularly have passed most delightful night at some distance from city road which had rhone or soane i cannot recollect which on one side range raised gardens with terraces on other it had been very hot day evening was delightful dew moistened fading grass no wind was stirring air was fresh without chillness setting sun had tinged clouds with beautiful crimson which was again reflected by water trees that bordered terrace were filled with nightingales who were continually answering each other s songs i walked along kind ecstasy giving up my heart senses enjoyment so many delights sighing only from regret enjoying them alone absorbed this pleasing reverie i lengthened my walk till it grew very late without perceiving i was tired at length however i discovered it threw myself on step kind niche or false door terrace wall how charming was couch trees formed stately canopy nightingale sat directly over me with his soft notes lulled me rest how pleasing my repose my awaking more so it was broad day on opening my eyes i saw water verdure admirable landscape before me i arose shook off remains drowsiness finding i was hungry retook way city resolving with inexpressible gayety spend two pieces six francs i had yet remaining good breakfast i found myself so cheerful that i went all way singing i even remember i sang cantata batistin s called baths thomery which i knew by heart may blessing light on good batistin his good cantata which procured me better breakfast than i had expected still better dinner which i did not expect at all midst my singing i heard some one behind me turning round perceived antonine who followed after seemed listen with pleasure my song at length accosting me he asked if i understood music i answered little but manner have it understood i knew great deal as he continued questioning me related part my story he asked me if i had ever copied music i replied often which was true i had learned most by copying well continued he come with me i can employ you for few days during which time you shall want for nothing provided you consent not quit my room i acquiesced very willingly followed him this antonine was called m rotichon he loved music understood it sang some little concerts with his friends thus far all was innocent right but apparently this taste had become furor part which he was obliged conceal he conducted me into chamber where i found great quantity music he gave me some copy particularly cantata he had heard me singing which he was shortly sing himself i remained here three or four days copying all time i did not eat for never my life was i so hungry or better fed m rolichon brought my provisions himself from kitchen it appeared that these good priests lived well at least if every one fared as i did my life i never took such pleasure eating it must be owned this good cheer came very opportunely for i was almost exhausted i worked as heartily as i ate which is saying great deal tis true i was not as correct as diligent for some days after meeting m rolichon street he informed me there were so many omissions repetitions transpositions parts i had copied that they could not be performed it must be owned that choosing profession music i hit on that i was least calculated for yet my voice was good i copied neatly but fatigue long works bewilders me so much that i spend more time altering scratching out than pricking down if i do not employ strictest attention comparing several parts they are sure fail execution thus through endeavoring do well my performance was very faulty for aiming at expedition i did all amiss this did not prevent m rolichon from treating me well last giving me half crown at my departure which i certainly did not deserve which completely set me up for few days after i received news from madam de warens who was at chambery with money defray expenses my journey her which i performed with rapture since then my finances have frequently been very low but never at such ebb as reduce me fasting i mark this period with heart fully alive bounty providence as last my life which i sustained poverty hunger i remained at lyons seven or eight days wait for some little commissions with which madam de warens had charged mademoiselle du chatelet who during this interval i visited more assiduously than before having pleasure talking with her her friend being no longer disturbed by cruel remembrance my situation or painful endeavors conceal it mademoiselle du chatelet was neither young nor handsome but did not want for elegance she was easy obliging while her understanding gave price her familiarity she had taste for that kind moral observation which leads knowledge mankind from her originated that study myself she was fond works le sage particularly gil blas which she lent me recommended my perusal i read this performance with pleasure but my judgment was not yet ripe enough relish that sort reading i liked romances which abounded with high flown sentiments thus did i pass my time at grate mademoiselle du chatelet with as much profit as pleasure it is certain that interesting sensible conversation deserving woman is more proper form understanding young man than all pedantic philosophy books i got acquainted at chasattes with some other boarders their friends among rest with young person fourteen called mademoiselle serre whom i did not much notice at that time though i was love with her eight or nine years afterwards with great reason for she was most charming girl i was fully occupied with idea seeing madam de warens this gave some respite my chimeras for finding happiness real objects i was less inclined seek it nonentities i had not only found her but also by her means near her agreeable situation having sent me word that she had procured one that would suit me by which i should not be obliged quit her i exhausted all my conjectures guessing what this occupation could be but i must have possessed art divination have hit it on right i had money sufficient make my journey agreeable mademoiselle du chatelet persuaded me hire horse but this i could not consent i was certainly right for by so doing i should have lost pleasure last pedestrian expedition i ever made for i cannot give that name those excursions i have frequently taken about my own neighborhood while i lived at motiers it is very singular that my imagination never rises so high as when my situation is least agreeable or cheerful when everything smiles around me i am least amused my heart cannot confine itself realities cannot embellish but must create real objects strike me as they really are my imagination can only decorate ideal ones if i would paint spring it must be winter if describe beautiful landscape it must be while surrounded with walls i have said hundred times that were i confined bastille i could draw most enchanting picture liberty on my departure from lyons i saw nothing but agreeable future content i now with reason enjoyed was as great as my discontent had been at leaving paris notwithstanding i had not during this journey any those delightful reveries i then enjoyed my mind was serene that was all i drew near excellent friend i was going see my heart overflowing with tenderness enjoying advance but without intoxication pleasure living near her i had always expected this it was as if nothing new had happened meantime i was anxious about employment madam de warens had procured me as if that alone had been material my ideas were calm peaceable not ravishing celestial every object struck my sight its natural form i observed surrounding landscape remarked trees houses springs deliberated on cross roads was fearful losing myself yet did not do so word i was no longer empyrean but precisely where i found myself or sometimes perhaps at end my journey never farther i am recounting my travels as i was making them loath arrive at conclusion my heart beat with joy as i approached my dear madam de warens but i went no faster on that account i love walk at my ease stop at leisure strolling life is necessary me travelling on foot fine country with fine weather having agreeable object terminate my journey is manner living all others most suited my taste it is already understood what i mean by fine country never can flat one though ever so beautiful appear such my eyes i must have torrents fir trees black woods mountains climb or descend rugged roads with precipices on either side alarm me i experienced this pleasure its utmost extent as i approached chambery not far from mountain which is called pas de l echelle above main road which is hewn through rock small river runs rushes into fearful chasms which it appears have been millions ages forming road has been hedged by parapet prevent accidents which enabled me contemplate whole descent gain vertigoes at pleasure for great part my amusement these steep rocks is they cause giddiness swimming my head which i am particularly fond provided i am safety leaning therefore over parapet i remained whole hours catching from time time glance froth blue water whose rushing caught my ear mingled with cries ravens other birds prey that flew from rock rock bush bush at six hundred feet below me places where slope was tolerably regular clear enough from bushes let stones roll freely i went considerable way gather them bringing those i could but just carry which i piled on parapet then threw down one after other being transported at seeing them roll rebound fly into thousand pieces before they reached bottom precipice near chambery i enjoyed equal pleasing spectacle though different kind road passing near foot most charming cascade i ever saw water which is very rapid shoots from top excessively steep mountain falling at such distance from its base that you may walk between cascade rock without any inconvenience but if not particularly careful it is easy be deceived as i was for water falling from such immense height separates descends rain as fine as dust on approaching too near this cloud without perceiving it you may be wet through instant at length i arrived at madam de warens she was not alone intendant general was with her without speaking word me she caught my hand presenting me him with that natural grace which charmed all hearts said this sir is poor young man i mentioned deign protect him as long as he deserves it i shall feel no concern for remainder his life then added addressing herself me child you now belong king thank monsieur intendant who furnishes you with means existence i stared without answering without knowing what think all this rising ambition almost turned my head i was already prepared act intendant myself my fortune however was not so brilliant as i had imagined but it was sufficient maintain me which as i was situated was capital acquisition i shall now explain nature my employment king victor amadeus judging by event preceding wars situation ancient patrimony his fathers that he should not long be able maintain it wished drain it beforehand resolving therefore tax nobility he ordered general survey whole country order that it might be rendered more equal productive this scheme which was begun under father was completed by son two or three hundred men part surveyors who were called geometricians part writers who were called secretaries were employed this work among those latter description madam de warens had got me appointed this post without being very lucrative furnished means living eligibly that country misfortune was this employment could not be any great duration but it put me train procure something better as by this means she hoped insure particular protection intendant who might find me some more settled occupation before this was concluded i entered on my new employment few days after my arrival as there was no great difficulty business soon understood it thus after four or five years unsettled life folly suffering since my departure from geneva i began for first time gain my bread with credit these long details my early youth must have appeared trifling i am sorry for it though born man variety instances i was long child am so yet many particulars i did not promise public great personage i promised describe myself as i am know me my advanced age it was necessary have known me my youth as general objects that are present make less impression on me than bare remembrance them my ideas being all from recollection first traits which were engraven on my mind have distinctly remained those which have since been imprinted there have rather combined with former than effaced them there is certain yet varied succession affections ideas which continue regulate those that follow them this progression must be known order judge rightly those they have influenced i have studied develop first causes better show concatenation effects i would be able by some means render my soul transparent eyes reader for this purpose endeavor show it every possible point view give him every insight act such manner that not motion should escape him as by this means he may form judgment principles that produce them did i take upon myself decide say reader such is my character he might think that if i did not endeavor deceive him i at least deceived myself but recounting simply all that has happened me all my actions thoughts feelings i cannot lead him into error unless i do it wilfully which by this means i could not easily effect since it is his province compare elements judge being they compose thus result must be his work if he is then deceived error will be his own it is not sufficient for this purpose that my recitals should be merely faithful they must also be minute it is not for me judge importance facts i ought declare them simply as they are leave estimate that is be formed them him i have adhered this principle hitherto with most scrupulous exactitude shall not depart from it continuation but impressions age are less lively than those youth i began by delineating latter should i recollect rest with same precision reader may perhaps become weary impatient but i shall not be dissatisfied with my labor i have but one thing apprehend this undertaking i do not dread saying too much or advancing falsities but i am fearful not saying enough or concealing truths book v it was i believe 1732 that i arrived at chambery as already related began my employment registering land for king i was almost twenty one my mind well enough formed for my age with respect sense but very deficient point judgment needing every instruction from those into whose hands i fell make me conduct myself with propriety for few years experience had not been able cure me radically my romantic ideas notwithstanding ills i had sustained i knew as little world or mankind as if i had never purchased instruction i slept at home that is at house madam de warens but it was not as at annecy here were no gardens no brook no landscape house was dark dismal my apartment most gloomy whole prospect dead wall alley instead street confined air bad light small rooms iron bars rats rotten floor assemblage circumstances that do not constitute very agreeable habitation but i was same house with my best friend incessantly near her at my desk or chamber so that i could not perceive gloominess my own or have time think it it may appear whimsical that she should reside at chambery on purpose live this disagreeable house but it was trait contrivance which i ought not pass over silence she had no great inclination for journey turin fearing that after recent revolutions agitation which court yet was she should not be very favorably received there but her affairs seemed demand her presence as she feared being forgotten or ill treated particularly as count de saint laurent intendent general finances was not her interest he had old house chambery ill built standing so disagreeable situation that it was always untenanted she hired settled this house plan that succeeded much better than journey turin would have done for her pension was not suppressed count de saint laurent was ever after one her best friends her household was much on old footing her faithful claude anet still remained with her he was as i have before mentioned peasant moutru who his childhood had gathered herbs jura for purpose making swiss tea she had taken him into her service for his knowledge drugs finding it convenient have herbalist among her domestics passionately fond study plants he became real botanist had he not died young might have acquired as much fame that science as he deserved for being honest man serious even gravity older than myself he was me kind tutor commanding respect preserving me from number follies for i dared not forget myself before him he commanded it likewise from his mistress who knew his understanding uprightness inviolable attachment herself returned it claude anet was uncommon temper i never encountered similar disposition he was slow deliberate circumspect his conduct cold his manner laconic sententious his discourse yet impetuosity his passions which though careful conceal preyed upon him inwardly urged him only folly he ever committed that folly indeed was terrible it was poisoning himself this tragic scene passed soon after my arrival opened my eyes intimacy that subsisted between claude anet his mistress for had not information come from her i should never have suspected it yet surely if attachment fidelity zeal could merit such recompense it was due him what further proves him worthy such distinction he never once abused her confidence they seldom disputed their disagreements ever ended amicably one indeed was not so fortunate his mistress passion said something affronting which not being able digest he consulted only with despair finding bottle laudanum at hand drank it off then went peaceably bed expecting awake no more madam de warens herself was uneasy agitated wandering about house happily finding phial empty guessed rest her screams while flying his assistance alarmed me she confessed all implored my help was fortunate enough after repeated efforts make him throw up laudanum witness this scene i could not but wonder at my stupidity never having suspected connection but claude anet was so discreet that more penetrating observer might have been deceived their reconciliation affected me added respect esteem i before felt for him from this time i became some measure his pupil nor did i find myself worse for his instruction i could not learn without pain that she lived greater intimacy with another than with myself it was situation i had not even thought but which was very natural it hurt me see another possession it nevertheless instead feeling any aversion person who had this advantage over me i found attachment i felt for her actually extend him i desired her happiness above all things since he was concerned her plan felicity i was content he should be happy likewise meantime he perfectly entered into views his mistress conceived sincere friendship for me without affecting authority his situation might have entitled him he naturally possessed that which his superior judgment gave him over mine i dared do nothing he disproved but he was sure disapprove only what merited disapprobation thus we lived union which rendered us mutually happy which death alone could dissolve one proof excellence this amiable woman s character is that all those who loved her loved each other even jealousy rivalship submitting more powerful sentiment with which she inspired them i never saw any those who surrounded her entertain least ill will among themselves let reader pause moment on this encomium if he can recollect any other woman who deserves it let him attach himself her if he would obtain happiness from my arrival at chambery my departure for paris 1741 included interval eight or nine years during which time i have few adventures relate my life being as simple as it was agreeable this uniformity was precisely what was most wanting complete formation my character which continual troubles had prevented from acquiring any degree stability it was during this pleasing interval that my unconnected unfinished education gained consistence made me what i have unalterably remained amid storms with which i have since been surrounded progress was slow almost imperceptible attended by few memorable circumstances yet it deserves be followed investigated at first i was wholly occupied with my business constraint desk left little opportunity for other thoughts small portion time i was at liberty was passed with my dear madam de warens not having leisure read i felt no inclination for it but when my business by daily repetition became familiar my mind was less occupied study again became necessary as my desires were ever irritated by any difficulty that opposed indulgence them might once more have become passion as at my master s had not other inclinations interposed diverted it though our occupation did not demand very profound skill arithmetic it sometimes required enough puzzle me conquer this difficulty i purchased books which treated on that science learned well for i now studied alone practical arithmetic extends further than is usually supposed if you would attain exact precision there are operations extreme length which i have sometimes seen good geometricians lose themselves reflection assisted by practice gives clear ideas enables you devise shorter methods these inventions flatter our self complacency while their exactitude satisfies our understanding renders study pleasant which is itself heavy unentertaining at length i became so expert as not be puzzled by any question that was solvable by arithmetical calculation even now while everything i formerly knew fades daily on my memory this acquirement great measure remains through interval thirty years few days ago journey i made davenport being with my host at arithmetical lesson given his children i did with pleasure without errors most complicated work while setting down my figures methought i was still at chambery still my days happiness how far had i look back for them colored plans our geometricians had given me taste for drawing accordingly i bought colors began by attempting flowers landscapes it was unfortunate that i had not talents for this art for my inclination was much disposed it while surrounded with crayons pencils colors i could have passed whole months without wishing leave them this amusement engaged me so much that they were obliged force me from it thus it is with every inclination i give into it continues augment till at length it becomes so powerful that i lose sight everything except favorite amusement years have not been able cure me that fault nay have not even diminished it for while i am writing this behold me like old dotard infatuated with another me useless study which i do not understand which even those who have devoted their youthful days acquisition are constrained abandon at age i am beginning with it at that time study i am now speaking would have been well placed opportunity was good i had some temptation profit by it for satisfaction i saw eyes anet when he came home loaded with new discovered plants set me two or three times on point going herbalize with him i am almost certain that had i gone once i should have been caught perhaps at this day might have been excellent botanist for i know no study more congenial my natural inclination than that plants life i have led for these ten years past country being little more than continual herbalizing though i must confess without object without improvement but at time i am now speaking i had no inclination for botany nay i even despised was disgusted at idea considering it only as fit study for apothecary madam de warens was fond it merely for this purpose seeking none but common plants use her medical preparations thus botany chemistry anatomy were confounded my idea under general denomination medicine served furnish me with pleasant sarcasms whole day which procured me from time time box on ear applied by madam de warens besides this very contrary taste grew up with me by degrees absorbed all others this was music i was certainly born for that science i loved it from my infancy it was only inclination i have constantly adhered but it is astonishing that what nature seemed have designed me for should have cost so much pains learn that i should acquire it so slowly that after whole life spent practice this art i could never attain sing with any certainty at sight what rendered study music more agreeable me at that time was being able practise it with madam de warens other respects our tastes were widely different this was point coincidence which i loved avail myself she had no more objection this than myself i knew at that time almost as much it as she did after two or three efforts we could make shift decipher air sometimes when i saw her busy at her furnace i have said here now is charming duet which seems made for very purpose spoiling your drugs her answer would be if you make me burn them i ll make you eat them thus disputing i drew her harpsichord furnace was presently forgotten extract juniper or wormwood calcined which i cannot recollect without transport these scenes usually ended by her smearing my face with remains them it may easily be conjectured that i had plenty employment fill up my leisure hours one amusement however found room that was well worth all rest illustration 0162 we lived such confined dungeon that it was necessary sometimes breathe open air anet therefore engaged madam de warens hire garden suburbs both for this purpose convenience rearing plants etc this garden was added summer house which was furnished customary manner we sometimes dined i frequently slept there insensibly i became attached this little retreat decorated it with books prints spending part my time ornamenting it during absence madam de warens that i might surprise her more agreeably on her return sometimes i quitted this dear friend that i might enjoy uninterrupted pleasure thinking on her this was caprice i can neither excuse nor fully explain i only know this really was case therefore i avow it i remember madam de luxembourg told me one day raillery man who used leave his mistress that he might enjoy satisfaction writing her i answered i could have been this man i might have added that i had done very same i did not however find it necessary leave madam de warens that i might love her more ardently for i was ever as perfectly free with her as when alone advantage i never enjoyed with any other person man or woman however i might be attached them but she was so often surrounded by company who were far from pleasing me that spite weariness drove me this asylum where i could indulge idea without danger being interrupted by impertinence thus my time being divided between business pleasure instruction my life passed most absolute serenity europe was not equally tranquil france emperor had mutually declared war king sardinia had entered into quarrel french army had filed off into piedmont awe milanese our division passed through chambery among others regiment champaigne whose colonel was duke de la trimouille whom i was presented he promised many things but doubtless never more thought me our little garden was exactly at end suburb by which troops entered so that i could fully satisfy my curiosity seeing them pass i became as anxious for success war as if it had nearly concerned me till now i had never troubled myself about politics for first time i began reading gazettes but with so much partiality on side france that my heart beat with rapture on its most trifling advantages i was as much afflicted on reverse fortune as if i had been particularly concerned had this folly been transient i should not perhaps have mentioned it but it took such root my heart without any reasonable cause that when i afterwards acted anti despot proud republican at paris spite myself i felt secret predilection for nation i declared servile for that government i affected oppose pleasantest all was that ashamed inclination so contrary my professed maxims i dared not own it any one but rallied french on their defeats while my heart was more wounded than their own i am certainly first man that living with people who treated him well whom he almost adored put on even their own country borrowed air despising them yet my original inclination is so powerful constant disinterested invincible that even since my quitting that kingdom since its government magistrates authors have outvied each other rancor against me since it has become fashionable load me with injustice abuse i have not been able get rid this folly but notwithstanding their ill treatment love them spite myself i long sought cause this partiality but was never able find any except occasion that gave it birth rising taste for literature attached me french books their authors their country at very moment french troops were passing chambery i was reading brantome s celebrated captains my head was full clissons bayards lautrecs colignys montmorenceys trimouille i loved their descendants as heirs their merit courage each regiment that passed by methought i saw those famous black bands who had formerly done so many noble exploits piedmont fine i applied these all ideas i had gathered from books my reading continued which still drawn from same nation nourished my affection for that country till at length it became blind passion which nothing could overcome i have had occasion remark several times course my travels that this impression was not peculiar me for france but was more or less active every country for that part nation who were fond literature cultivated learning it was this consideration that balanced my mind general hatred which conceited air french is so apt inspire their romances more than their men attract women all countries celebrated dramatic pieces france create fondness youth for their theaters reputation which that paris particular has acquired draws it crowds strangers who return enthusiasts their own country short excellence their literature captivates senses unfortunate war just ended i have seen their authors philosophers maintain glory france so tarnished by its warriors i was therefore ardent frenchman this rendered me politician i attended public square amid throng news mongers arrival post sillier than ass fable was very uneasy know whose packsaddle i should next have honor carry for it was then supposed we should belong france that savoy would be exchanged for milan i must confess however that i experienced some uneasiness for had this war terminated unfortunately for allies pension madam de warens would have been dangerous situation nevertheless i had great confidence my good friends french for once spite surprise m de broglio my confidence was not ill founded thanks king sardinia whom i had never thought while we were fighting italy they were singing france operas rameau began make noise there once more raise credit his theoretic works which from their obscurity were within compass very few understandings by chance i heard his treatise on harmony had no rest till i purchased it by another chance i fell sick my illness was inflammatory short violent but my convalescence was tedious for i was unable go abroad for whole month during this time i eagerly ran over my treatise on harmony but it was so long so diffuse so badly disposed that i found it would require considerable time unravel it accordingly i suspended my inclination recreated my sight with music cantatas bernier were what i principally exercised myself with these were never out my mind i learned four or five by heart among rest sleeping cupids which i have never seen since that time though i still retain it almost entirely as well as cupid stung by bee very pretty cantata by clerambault which i learned about same time complete me there arrived young organist from valdoste called abbe palais good musician agreeable companion who performed very well on harpsichord i got acquainted with him we soon became inseparable he had been brought up by italian monk who was capital organist he explained me his principles music which i compared with rameau my head was filled with accompaniments concords harmony but as it was necessary accustom ear all this i proposed madam de warens having little concert once month which she consented behold me then so full this concert that night or day i could think nothing else it actually employed great part my time select music assemble musicians look instruments write out several parts madam de warens sang father cato whom i have before mentioned shall have occasion speak again sang likewise dancing master named roche his son played on violin canavas piedmontese musician who was employed like myself survey has since married at paris played on violoncello abbe palais performed on harpsichord i had honor conduct whole it may be supposed all this was charming i cannot say it equalled my concert at monsieur de tretoren s but certainly it was not far behind it this little concert given by madam de warens new convert who lived it was expressed on king s charity made whole tribe devotees murmur but was very agreeable amusement several worthy people at head whom it would not be easily surmised that i should place monk yet though monk man considerable merit even very amiable disposition whose subsequent misfortunes gave me most lively concern whose idea attached that my happy days is yet dear my memory i speak father cato cordelier who conjunction with count d ortan had caused music poor le maitre be seized at lyons which action was far from being brightest trait his history he was bachelor sorbonne had lived long paris among great world was particularly caressed by marquis d antremont then ambassador from sardinia he was tall well made full faced with very fine eyes black hair which formed natural curls on each side his forehead his manner was at once noble open modest he presented himself with ease good manners having neither hypocritical nor impudent behavior monk or forward assurance fashionable coxcomb but manners well bred man who without blushing for his habit set value on himself ever felt his proper situation when good company though father cato was not deeply studied for doctor he was much so for man world not being compelled show his talents he brought them forward so advantageously that they appeared greater than they really were having lived much world he had rather attached himself agreeable acquirements than solid learning had sense made verses spoke well sang better aided his good voice by playing on organ harpsichord so many pleasing qualities were not necessary make his company sought after accordingly it was very much so but this did not make him neglect duties his function he was chosen spite his jealous competitors definitor his province or according them one greatest pillars their order father cato became acquainted with madam de warens at marquis antremont s he had heard her concerts wished assist at them by his company rendered our meetings truly agreeable we were soon attached each other by our mutual taste for music which both was most lively passion with this difference that he was really musician myself bungler sometimes assisted by canavas abbe palais we had music his apartment or on holidays at his organ frequently dined with him for what was very astonishing monk he was generous profuse loved good cheer without least tincture greediness after our concerts he always used stay supper these evenings passed with greatest gayety good humor we conversed with utmost freedom sang duets i was perfectly at my ease had sallies wit merriment father cato was charming madam de warens adorable abbe palais with his rough voice was butt company pleasing moments sportive youth how long since have ye fled as i shall have no more occasion speak poor father cato i will here conclude few words his melancholy history his brother monks jealous or rather exasperated discover him merit elegance manners which favored nothing monastic stupidity conceived most violent hatred him because he was not as despicable as themselves chiefs therefore combined against this worthy man set on envious rabble monks who otherwise would not have dared hazard attack he received thousand indignities they degraded him from his office took away apartment which he had furnished with elegant simplicity at length banished him i know not whither short these wretches overwhelmed him with so many evils that his honest proud soul sank under pressure after having been delight most amiable societies he died grief on wretched bed hid some cell or dungeon lamented by all worthy people his acquaintance who could find no fault him except his being monk accustomed this manner life for some time i became so entirely attached music that i could think nothing else i went my business with disgust necessary confinement assiduity appeared insupportable punishment which i at length wished relinquish that i might give myself up without reserve my favorite amusement it will be readily believed that this folly met with some opposition give up creditable employment fixed salary run after uncertain scholars was too giddy plan be approved by madam de warens even supposing my future success should prove as great as i flattered myself it was fixing very humble limits my ambition think reducing myself for life condition music master she who formed for me brightest projects no longer trusted implicitly judgment m d aubonne seeing with concern that i was so seriously occupied with talent which she thought frivolous frequently repeated me that provincial proverb which does not hold quite so good paris qui biens chante et biens dance fait un metier qui peu avance he who can sweetly sing featly dance his interests right little shall advance on other hand she saw me hurried away by this irresistible passion my taste for music having become furor it was much be feared that my employment suffering by my distraction might draw on me discharge which would be worse than voluntary resignation i represented her that this employment could not last long that it was necessary i should have some permanent means subsistence that it would be much better complete by practice acquisition that art which my inclination led me than make fresh essays which possibly might not succeed since by this means having passed age most proper for improvement i might be left without single resource for gaining livelihood short i extorted her consent more by importunity caresses than by any satisfactory reasons proud my success i immediately ran thank m coccelli director general survey as though i had performed most heroic action quitted my employment without cause reason or pretext with as much pleasure as i had accepted it two years before this step ridiculous as it may appear procured me kind consideration which i found extremely useful some supposed i had resources which i did not possess others seeing me totally given up music judged my abilities by sacrifice i had made concluded that with such passion for art i must possess it superior degree nation blind men those with one eye are kings i passed here for excellent master because all rest were very bad ones possessing taste singing being favored by my age figure i soon procured more scholars than were sufficient compensate for losses my secretary s pay it is certain that had it been reasonable consider pleasure my situation only it was impossible pass more speedily from one extreme other at our measuring i was confined eight hours day most unentertaining employment with yet more disagreeable company shut up melancholy counting house empoisoned by smell respiration number clowns major part whom were ill combed very dirty what with attention bad air constraint weariness i was sometimes so far overcome as occasion vertigo instead this behold me admitted into fashionable world sought after first houses everywhere received with air satisfaction amiable gay young ladies awaiting my arrival welcoming me with pleasure i see nothing but charming objects smell nothing but roses orange flowers singing chatting laughter amusements perpetually succeed each other it must be allowed that reckoning all these advantages no hesitation was necessary choice fact i was so content with mine that i never once repented it nor do i even now when free from irrational motives that influenced me at that time i weigh scale reason every action my life this is perhaps only time that listening inclination i was not deceived my expectations easy access obliging temper free humor this country rendered commerce with world agreeable inclination i then felt for it proves me that if i have dislike for society it is more their fault than mine it is pity savoyards are not rich though perhaps it would be still greater pity if they were so for altogether they are best most sociable people that i know if there is little city world where pleasures life are experienced agreeable friendly commerce it is at chambery gentry province who assemble there have only sufficient wealth live not enough spoil them they cannot give way ambition but follow through necessity counsel cyneas devoting their youth military employment returning home grow old peace arrangement over which honor reason equally preside women are handsome yet do not stand need beauty since they possess all those qualifications which enhance its value even supply want it it is remarkable that being obliged by my profession see number young girls i do not recollect one at chambery but what was charming it will be said i was disposed find them so perhaps there may be some truth surmise i cannot remember my young scholars without pleasure why naming most amiable cannot i recall them myself also that happy age which our moments pleasing as innocent were passed with such happiness together first was mademoiselle de mallarede my neighbor sister pupil monsieur gaime she was fine clear brunette lively graceful without giddiness thin as girls that age usually are but her bright eyes fine shape easy air rendered her sufficiently pleasing with that degree plumpness which would have given heightening her charms i went there mornings when she was usually her dishabille her hair carelessly turned up on my arrival ornamented with flower which was taken off at my departure for her hair be dressed there is nothing i fear so much as pretty woman elegant dishabille i should dread them hundred times less full dress mademoiselle de menthon whom i attended afternoon was ever so she made equally pleasing but quite different impression on me her hair was flaxen her person delicate she was very timid extremely fair had clear voice capable just modulation but which she had not courage employ its full extent she had mark scald on her bosom which scanty piece blue chenille did not entirely cover this scar sometimes drew my attention though not absolutely on its own account mademoiselle des challes another my neighbors was woman grown tall well formed jolly very pleasing though not beauty might be quoted for her gracefulness equal temper good humor her sister madam de charly handsomest woman chambery did not learn music but i taught her daughter who was yet young but whose growing beauty promised equal her mother s if she had not unfortunately been little red haired i had likewise among my scholars little french lady whose name i have forgotten but who merits place my list preferences she had adopted slow drawling tone nuns which voice she would utter some very keen things which did not least appear correspond with her manner but she was indolent could not generally take pains show her wit that being favor she did not grant every one after month or two negligent attendance this was expedient she devised make me more assiduous for i could not easily persuade myself be so when with my scholars i was fond enough teaching but could not bear idea being obliged attend at particular hour constraint subjection every shape are me insupportable alone sufficient make me hate even pleasure itself i had some scholars likewise among tradespeople among others one who was indirect cause change relationship which as i have promised declare all i must relate its place she was daughter grocer was called mademoiselle de larnage perfect model for grecian statue whom i should quote for handsomest girl i have ever seen if true beauty could exist without life or soul her indolence reserve insensibility were inconceivable it was equally impossible please or make her angry i am convinced that had any one formed design upon her virtue he might have succeeded not through her inclination but from her stupidity her mother who would run no risk this did not leave her single moment having her taught sing providing young master she had hoped enliven her but it all proved ineffectual while master was admiring daughter mother was admiring master but this was equally lost labor madam de larnage added her natural vivacity that portion sprightliness which should have belonged daughter she was little ugly lively trollop with small twinkling ferret eyes marked with smallpox on my arrival morning i always found my coffee cream ready mother never failed welcome me with kiss on lips which i would willingly have returned daughter see how she would have received it all this was done with such air carelessness simplicity that even when m de larnage was present her kisses caresses were not omitted he was good quiet fellow true original his daughter nor did his wife endeavor deceive him because there was absolutely no occasion for it i received all these caresses with my usual stupidity taking them only for marks pure friendship though they were sometimes troublesome for lively madam lard was displeased if during day i passed shop without calling it became necessary therefore when i had no time spare go out my way through another street well knowing it was not so easy quit her house as enter it madam lard thought so much me that i could not avoid thinking something her her attentions affected me greatly i spoke them madam de warens without supposing any mystery matter but had there been one i should equally have divulged it for have kept secret any kind from her would have been impossible my heart lay as open madam de warens as heaven she did not understand matter quite so simply as i had done but saw advances where i only discovered friendship she concluded that madam lard would make point not leaving me as great fool as she found me some way or other contrive make herself understood but exclusive consideration that it was not just that another should undertake instruction her pupil she had motives more worthy her wishing guard me against snares which my youth inexperience exposed me meantime more dangerous temptation offered which i likewise escaped but which proved her that such succession dangers required every preservative she could possibly apply countess menthon mother one my scholars was woman great wit reckoned possess at least equal share mischief having as was reported caused number quarrels among others one that terminated fatally for house d antremont madam de warens had seen enough her know her character for having very innocently pleased some person whom madam de menthon had pretensions she found her guilty crime this preference though madam de warens had neither sought after nor accepted it from that moment endeavored play her rival number ill turns none which succeeded i shall relate one most whimsical by way specimen they were together country with several gentlemen neighborhood among rest lover question madam de menthon took opportunity say one these gentlemen that madam de warens was prude that she dressed ill particularly that she covered her neck like tradeswoman o for that matter replied person she was speaking who was fond joke she has good reason for i know she is marked with great ugly rat on her bosom so naturally that it even appears be running hatred as well as love renders its votaries credulous madam de menthon resolved make use this discovery one day while madam de warens was at cards with this lady s ungrateful favorite she contrived passing behind her rival almost overset chair she sat on at same instant very dexterously displaced her handkerchief but instead this hideous rat gentleman beheld far different object which it was not more easy forget than obtain sight which by no means answered intentions lady i was not calculated engross attention madam de menthon who loved be surrounded by brilliant company notwithstanding she bestowed some attention on me not for sake my person which she certainly did not regard but for reputation wit which i had acquired which might have rendered me convenient her predominant inclination she had very lively passion for ridicule loved write songs lampoons on those who displeased her had she found me possessed sufficient talents aid fabrication her verses complaisance enough do so we should presently have turned chambery upside down these libels would have been traced their source madam de menthon would have saved herself by sacrificing me i should have been cooped up prison perhaps for rest my life as recompense for having figured away as apollo ladies fortunately nothing this kind happened madam de menthon made me stay for dinner two or three days chat with me soon found i was too dull for her purpose i felt this myself was humiliated at discovery envying talents my friend venture though i should rather have been obliged my stupidity for keeping me out reach danger i remained therefore madam de menthon s daughter s singing master nothing more but i lived happily was ever well received at chambery which was thousand times more desirable than passing for wit with her for serpent with everybody else however this might be madam de warens conceived it necessary guard me from perils youth by treating me as man this she immediately set about but most extraordinary manner that any woman similar circumstances ever devised i all at once observed that her manner was graver her discourse more moral than usual playful gayety with which she used intermingle her instructions suddenly succeeded uniformity manner neither familiar nor severe but which seemed prepare me for some explanation after having vainly racked my brain for reason this change i mentioned it her this she had expected immediately proposed walk our garden next day accordingly we went there next morning she had contrived that we should remain alone whole day which she employed preparing me for those favors she meant bestow not as another woman would have done by toying folly but by discourses full sentiment reason rather tending instruct than seduce which spoke more my heart than my senses meantime however excellent purpose these discourses might be though far enough from coldness or melancholy i did not listen them with all attention they merited nor fix them my memory as i should have done at any other time that air preparation which she had adopted gave me degree inquietude while she spoke spite myself i was thoughtful absent attending less what she said than curious know what she aimed at no sooner had i comprehended her design which i could not easily do than novelty idea which during all years i had passed with her had never once entered my imagination took such entire possession me that i was no longer capable minding what she said i only thought her i heard her no longer thinking render young minds attentive reason by proposing some highly interesting object as result it is error instructors frequently run into one which i have not avoided my umilius young pupil struck with object presented him is occupied only with that leaping lightly over your preliminary discourses lights at once on point which his idea you lead him too tediously render him attentive he must be prevented from seeing whole your design this particular madam de warens did not act with sufficient precaution by singularity which adhered her systematic disposition she took vain precaution proposing conditions but moment i knew purchase i no longer even heard them but immediately consented everything i doubt whether there is man on whole earth who would have been sincere or courageous enough dispute terms or one single woman who would have pardoned such dispute by continuation same whimsicality she attached number gravest formalities acquisition her favors gave me eight days think them which i assured her i had no need though that assurance was far from truth for complete this assemblage singularities i was very glad have this intermission so much had novelty these ideas struck me such disorder did i feel mine that it required time arrange them it will be supposed that these eight days appeared me as many ages on contrary i should have been very glad had time been lengthened i find it difficult describe state i found myself it was strange chaos fear impatience dreading what i desired studying some civil pretext evade my happiness let warmth my constitution be remembered my age my heart intoxicated with love let my tender attachment her be supposed which far from having diminished had daily gained additional strength let it be considered that i was only happy when with her that my heart was full not only her bounty her amiable disposition but her shape her person herself word conceive me united her by every affinity that could possibly render her dear nor let it be supposed that being ten or twelve years older than myself she began grow old woman or was so my opinion from time first sight her had made such impression on me she had really altered very little my mind not at all me she was ever charming was still thought so by everyone she had got something jollier but had same fine eyes same clear complexion same features same beautiful light hair sane gayety even same voice whose youthful silvery sound made so lively impression on my heart that even this day i cannot hear young woman s voice that is at all harmonious without emotion it will be seen that more advanced age bare idea some trifling favors i had expect from person i loved inflamed me so far that i could not support with any degree patience time necessary traverse short space that separated us how then by what miracle when flower my youth had i so little impatience for happiness i had never tasted but idea how could i see moment advancing with more pain than pleasure why instead transports that should have intoxicated me with their deliciousness did i experience only fears repugnance i have no doubt that if i could have avoided this happiness with any degree decency i should have relinquished it with all my heart i have promised number extravagancies history my attachment her this certainly is one that no idea could be formed reader already disgusted supposes that being situation i have before described with claude anet she was already degraded my opinion by this participation her favors that sentiment disesteem weakened those she had before inspired me with but he is mistaken tis true that this participation gave me cruel uneasiness as well from very natural sentiment delicacy as because it appeared unworthy both her myself but as my sentiments for her they were still same i can solemnly aver that i never loved her more tenderly than when i felt so little propensity avail myself her condescension i was too well acquainted with chastity her heart iciness her constitution suppose moment that gratification senses had any influence over her i was well convinced that her only motive was guard me from dangers which appeared otherwise inevitable by this extraordinary favor which she did not consider same light that women usually do as will presently be explained habit living long time innocently together far from weakening first sentiments i felt for her had contributed strengthen them giving more lively more tender but at same time less sensual turn my affection having ever accustomed myself call her mama as formerly observed enjoying familiarity son it became natural consider myself as such i am inclined think this was true reason that insensibility with person i so tenderly loved for i can perfectly recollect that my emotions on first seeing her though not more lively were more voluptuous at annecy i was intoxicated at chambery i possessed my reason i always loved her as passionately as possible but i now loved her more for herself less on my own account or at least i rather sought for happiness than pleasure her company she was more me than sister mother friend or even than mistress for this very reason she was not mistress word i loved her too much desire her this day more dreaded than hoped for at length arrived i have before observed that i promised everything that was required me i kept my word my heart confirmed my engagements without desiring fruits though at length i obtained them was i happy no i felt i know not what invincible sadness which empoisoned my happiness it seemed that i had committed incest two or three times pressing her eagerly my arms i deluged her bosom with my tears on her part as she had never sought pleasure she had not stings remorse i repeat it all her failings were effect her errors never her passions she was well born her heart was pure her manners noble her desires regular virtuous her taste delicate she seemed formed for that elegant purity manners which she ever loved but never practised because instead listening dictates her heart she followed those her reason which led her astray for when once corrupted by false principles it will ever run counter its natural sentiments unhappily she piqued herself on philosophy morals she drew from thence clouded genuine purity her heart m tavel her first lover was also her instructor this philosophy principles he instilled into her mind were such as tended seduce her finding her cold impregnable on side her passions firmly attached her husband her duty he attacked her by sophisms endeavoring prove that list duties she thought so sacred was but sort catechism fit only for children that kind infidelity she thought so terrible was itself absolutely indifferent that all morality conjugal faith consisted opinion contentment husbands being only reasonable rule duty wives consequently that concealed infidelities doing no injury could be no crime word he persuaded her that sin consisted only scandal that woman being really virtuous who took care appear so thus deceiver obtained his end subverting reason girl whose heart he found it impossible corrupt received his punishment devouring jealousy being persuaded she would treat him as he had prevailed on her treat her husband i don t know whether he was mistaken this respect minister perret passed for his successor all i know is that coldness temperament which it might have been supposed would have kept her from embracing this system end prevented her from renouncing it she could not conceive how so much importance should be given what seemed have none for her nor could she honor with name virtue abstinence which would have cost her little she did not therefore give this false principle on her own account but for sake others that from another maxim almost as false as former but more consonant generosity her disposition she was persuaded that nothing could attach man so truly any woman as unbounded freedom though she was only susceptible friendship this friendship was so tender that she made use every means which depended on her secure objects it which is very extraordinary almost always succeeded for she was so truly amiable that increase intimacy was sure discover additional reasons love respect her another thing worthy remark is that after her first folly she only favored unfortunate lovers more brilliant station lost their labor with her but man who at first attracted her pity must have possessed very few good qualities if end he did not obtain her affection even when she made unworthy choice far from proceeding from base inclinations which were strangers her noble heart it was effect disposition too generous humane compassionate sensible which she did not always govern with sufficient discernment if some false principles misled her how many admirable ones did she not possess which never forsook her by how many virtues did she atone for her failings if we can call by that name errors which senses had so little share man who one particular deceived her so completely had given her excellent instructions thousand others her passions being far from turbulent permitted her follow dictates she ever acted wisely when her sophisms did not intervene her designs were laudable even her failings false principles might lead her do ill but she never did anything which she conceived be wrong she abhorred lying duplicity was just equitable humane disinterested true her word her friends those duties which she conceived be such incapable hatred or revenge not even conceiving there was merit pardoning fine return those qualities which were less excusable though she did not properly value she never made vile commerce her favors she lavished but never sold them though continually reduced expedients for subsistence i dare assert that if socrates could esteem aspasia he would have respected madam de warens i am well aware that ascribing sensibility heart with coldness temperament same person i shall generally with great appearance reason be accused contradiction perhaps nature sported or blundered this combination ought not have existed i only know it did exist all those who know madam de warens great number whom are yet living have had opportunities knowing this was fact i dare even aver she had but one pleasure world which was serving those she loved let every one argue on point as he pleases gravely prove that this cannot be my business is declare truth not enforce belief it i became acquainted with particulars i have just related those conversations which succeeded our union alone rendered it delicious she was right when she concluded her complaisance would be useful me i derived great advantages from it point useful instruction hitherto she had used me as child she now began treat me as man entertain me with accounts herself everything she said was so interesting i was so sensibly touched with it that reasoning with myself i applied these confidential relations my own improvement received more instruction from them than from her teaching when we truly feel that heart speaks our own opens receive its instructions nor can all pompous morality pedagogue have half effect that is produced by tender affectionate artless conversation sensible woman on him who loves her intimacy which i lived with madam de warens having placed me more advantageously her opinion than formerly she began think notwithstanding my awkward manner that i deserved cultivation for polite world that if i could one day show myself there eligible situation i should soon be able make my way consequence this idea she set about forming not only my judgment but my address endeavoring render me amiable as well as estimable if it is true that success this world is consistent with strict virtue which for my part i do not believe i am certain there is no other road than that she had taken wished point out me for madam de warens knew mankind understood exquisitely well art treating all ranks without falsehood without imprudence neither deceiving nor provoking them but this art was rather her disposition than her precepts she knew better how practise than explain it i was all world least calculated become master such attainment accordingly means employed for this purpose were nearly lost labor as well as pains she took procure me fencing dancing master though very well made i could never learn dance minuet for being plagued with corns i had acquired habit walking on my heels which roche dancing master could never break me it was still worse at fencing school where after three months practice i made but very little progress could never attempt fencing with any but my master my wrist was not supple enough nor my arm sufficiently firm retain foil whenever he chose make it fly out my hand add this i had mortal aversion both art itself person who undertook teach it me nor should i ever have imagined that anyone could have been so proud science sending men out world bring this vast genius within compass my comprehension he explained himself by comparisons drawn from music which he understood nothing he found striking analogies between hit quarte or tierce with intervals music which bears those names when he made feint he cried out take care this diesis because anciently they called diesis feint when he had made foil fly from my hand he would add with sneer that this was pause word i never my life saw more insupportable pedant i made therefore but little progress my exercises which i presently quitted from pure disgust but i succeeded better art thousand times more value namely that being content with my situation not desiring one more brilliant for which i began be persuaded that nature had not designed me given up endeavor rendering madam de warens happy i was ever best pleased when her company notwithstanding my fondness for music began grudge time i employed giving lessons my scholars i am ignorant whether anet perceived full extent our union but i am inclined think he was no stranger it he was young man great penetration still greater discretion who never belied his sentiments but did not always speak them without giving me least hint that he was acquainted with our intimacy he appeared by his conduct be so nor did this moderation proceed from baseness soul but having entered entirely into principles his mistress he could not reasonably disapprove natural consequences them though as young as herself he was so grave thoughtful that he looked on us as two children who required indulgence we regarded him as respectable man whose esteem we had preserve it was not until after she was unfaithful anet that i learned strength her attachment him she was fully sensible that i only thought felt or lived for her she let me see therefore how much she loved anet that i might love him likewise dwell less on her friendship than on her esteem for him because this was sentiment that i could most fully partake how often has she affected our hearts made us embrace with tears by assuring us that we were both necessary her happiness let not women read this with ill natured smile with temperament she possessed this necessity was not equivocal it was only that heart thus there was established among us three union without example perhaps on face earth all our wishes our cares our very hearts were for each other absolutely confined this little circle habit living together living exclusively from rest world became so strong that if at our repasts one three was wanting or fourth person came everything seemed deranged notwithstanding our particular attachments even our tete tete were less agreeable than our reunion what banished every species constraint from our little community was lively reciprocal confidence dulness or insipidity could find no place among us because we were always fully employed madam de warens always projecting always busy left us no time for idleness though indeed we had each sufficient employment on our own account it is my maxim that idleness is as much pest society as solitude nothing more contracts mind or engenders more tales mischief gossiping lies than for people be eternally shut up same apartment together reduced from want employment necessity incessant chat when every one is busy unless you have really something say you may continue silent but if you have nothing do you must absolutely speak continually this my mind is most burdensome most dangerous constraint i will go further maintain that render company harmless as well as agreeable it is necessary not only that they should have something do but something that requires degree attention knitting for instance is absolutely as bad as doing nothing you must take as much pains amuse woman whose fingers are thus employed as if she sat with her arms crossed but let her embroider it is different matter she is then so far busied that few intervals silence may be borne with what is most disgusting ridiculous during these intermissions conversation is see perhaps dozen over grown fellows get up sit down again walk backwards forwards turn on their heels play with chimney ornaments rack their brains maintain inexhaustible chain words what charming occupation such people wherever they go must be troublesome both others themselves when i was at motiers i used employ myself making laces with my neighbors were i again mix with world i would always carry cup ball my pocket i should sometimes play with it whole day that i might not be constrained speak when i had nothing discourse about i am persuaded that if every one would do same mankind would be less mischievous their company would become more rational my opinion vast deal more agreeable word let wits laugh if they please but i maintain that only practical lesson morality within reach present age is that cup ball at chambery they did not give us trouble studying expedients avoid weariness when by ourselves for troop important visitors gave us too much by their company feel any when alone annoyance they formerly gave me had not diminished all difference was that i now found less opportunity abandon myself my dissatisfaction poor madam de warens had not lost her old predilection for schemes systems on contrary more she felt pressure her domestic necessities more she endeavored extricate herself from them by visionary projects proportion decrease her present resources she contrived enlarge idea those future increase years only strengthened this folly as she lost her relish for pleasures world youth she replaced it by additional fondness for secrets projects her house was never clear quacks contrivers new manufactures alchemists projects all kinds all descriptions whose discourses began by distribution millions concluded by giving you understand that they were want crown piece no one went from her empty handed what astonished me most was how she could so long support such profusion without exhausting source or wearying her creditors her principal project at time i am now speaking was that establishing royal physical garden at chambery with demonstrator attached it it will be unnecessary add for whom this office was designed situation this city midst alps was extremely favorable botany as madam de warens was always for helping out one project with another college pharmacy was be added which really would have been very useful foundation so poor country where apothecaries are almost only medical practitioners retreat chief physician grossi chambery on demise king victor seemed favor this idea or perhaps first suggest it however this may be by flattery attention she set about managing grossi who fact was not very manageable being most caustic brutal for man who had any pretensions quality gentleman that ever i knew reader may judge for himself by two or three traits character which i shall add by way specimen he assisted one day at consultation with some other doctors among rest young gentleman from annecy who was physician ordinary sick person this young man being but indifferently taught for doctor was bold enough differ opinion from m grossi who only answered him by asking him when he should return which way he meant take what conveyance he should make use other having satisfied grossi these particulars asked him if there was anything he could serve him nothing nothing answered he only i shall place myself at window your way that i may have pleasure seeing ass ride on horseback his avarice equalled his

devotions who proposed him same employment not knowing how refuse he knelt down with frightful grimace but had hardly recited two ave marias when not being able contain himself any longer he rose hastily snatched his hat cane without speaking word was making toward door count picon ran after him crying monsieur grossi monsieur grossi stop there s most excellent ortolan on spit for you monsieur le count replied other turning his head though you should give me roasted angel i would not stay such was m grossi whom madam de warens undertook succeeded civilizing though his time was very much occupied he accustomed himself come frequently her house conceived friendship for anet seemed think him intelligent spoke him with esteem what would not have been expected such brute affected treat him with respect wishing efface impressions past for though anet was no longer on footing domestic it was known that he had been one nothing less than countenance example chief physician was necessary set example respect which would not otherwise have been paid him thus claude anet with black coat well dressed wig grave decent behavior circumspect conduct tolerable knowledge medical botanical matters might reasonably have hoped fill with universal satisfaction place public demonstrator had proposed establishment taken place grossi highly approved plan only waited opportunity propose it administration whenever return peace should permit them think useful institutions enable them spare necessary pecuniary supplies but this project whose execution would probably have plunged me into botanical studies for which i am inclined think nature designed me failed through one those unexpected strokes which frequently overthrow best concerted plans i was destined become example human misery it might be said that providence who called me by degrees these extraordinary trials disconcerted every opportunity that could prevent my encountering them excursion which anet made top mountain seek for genipi scarce plant that grows only on alps which monsieur grossi had occasion for unfortunately he heated himself so much that he was seized with pleurisy which genipi could not relieve though said be specific that disorder notwithstanding all art grossi who certainly was very skillful all care his good mistress myself he died fifth day his disorder most cruel agonies during his illness he had no exhortations but mine bestowed with such transports grief zeal that had he been state understand them they must have been some consolation him thus i lost firmest friend i ever had man estimable extraordinary whom nature supplied defects education who though state servitude possessed all virtues necessary form great man which perhaps he would have shown himself been acknowledged had he lived fill situation he seemed so perfectly adapted next day i spoke him madam de warens with most sincere lively affection when suddenly midst our conversation vile ungrateful thought occurred that i should inherit his wardrobe particularly handsome black coat which i thought very becoming as i thought this i consequently uttered it for when with her think speak was same thing nothing could have made her feel more forcibly loss she had sustained than this unworthy odious observation disinterestedness greatness soul being qualities that poor anet had eminently possessed generous madam de warens turned from me without any reply burst into tears dear precious tears your reprehension was fully felt ye ran into my very heart washing from thence even smallest traces such despicable unworthy sentiments never return this loss caused madam de warens as much inconvenience as sorrow since from this moment her affairs were still more deranged anet was extremely exact kept everything order his vigilance was universally feared this set some bounds that profusion they were too apt run into even madam de warens avoid his censure kept her dissipation within bounds his attachment was not sufficient she wished preserve his esteem avoid just remonstrances he sometimes took liberty make her by representing that she squandered property others as well as her own i thought as he did nay i even sometimes expressed myself same effect but had not equal ascendancy over her my advice did not make same impression on his decease i was obliged occupy his place for which i had as little inclination as abilities therefore filled it ill i was not sufficiently careful so very timid that though i frequently found fault myself i saw ill management without taking courage oppose it besides though i acquired equal share respect i had not same authority i saw disorder that prevailed trembled at it sometimes complained but was never attended i was too young lively have any pretensions exercise reason when i would have acted reformer madam de warens calling me her little mentor with two or three playful slaps on cheek reduced me my natural thoughtlessness notwithstanding idea certain distress which her ill regulated expenses sooner or later must necessarily plunge her made stronger impression on me since i had become inspector her household had better opportunity calculating inequality that subsisted between her income her expenses i even date from this period beginning that inclination avarice which i have ever since been sensible i was never foolishly prodigal except by intervals but till then i was never concerned whether i had much or little money i now began pay more attention this circumstance taking care my purse becoming mean from laudable motive for i only sought insure madam de warens some resources against that catastrophe which i dreaded approach i feared her creditors would seize her pension or that it might be discontinued she reduced want when i foolishly imagined that trifle i could save might be essential service her but accomplish this it was necessary i should conceal what i meant make reserve for it would have been awkward circumstance while she was perpetually driven expedients have her know that i hoarded money accordingly i sought out some hiding place where i laid up few louis resolving augment this stock from time time till convenient opportunity lay it at her feet but i was so incautious choice my repositories that she always discovered them convince me that she did so changed louis i had concealed for larger sum different pieces coin ashamed these discoveries i brought back common purse my little treasure which she never failed lay out clothes or other things for my use such as silver hilted sword watch etc being convinced that i should never succeed accumulating money that what i could save would furnish but very slender resource against misfortune i dreaded made me wish place myself such situation that i might be enabled provide for her whenever she might chance be reduced want unhappily seeking these resources on side my inclinations i foolishly determined consider music as my principal dependence ideas harmony rising my brain i imagined that if placed proper situation profit by them i should acquire celebrity presently become modern orpheus whose mystic sounds would attract all riches peru as i began read music tolerably well question was how i should learn composition difficulty lay meeting with good master for with assistance my rameau alone i despaired ever being able accomplish it since departure m le maitre there was nobody savoy who understood anything principles harmony i am now about relate another those inconsequences which my life is full which have so frequently carried me directly from my designs even when i thought myself immediately within reach them venture had spoken me very high terms abbe blanchard who had taught him composition deserving man possessed great talents who was music master cathedral at besancon is now that capacity at chapel versailles i therefore determined go besancon take some lessons from abbe blanchard idea appeared so rational me that i soon made madam de warens same opinion who immediately set about preparations for my journey same style profusion with which all her plans were executed thus this project for preventing bankruptcy repairing future waste dissipation began by causing her expend eight hundred livres her ruin being accelerated that i might be put condition prevent it foolish as this conduct may appear illusion was complete on my part even on hers for i was persuaded i should labor for her emolument she thought she was highly promoting mine i expected find venture still at annecy promised myself obtain recommendatory letter from him abbe blanchard but he had left that place i was obliged content myself room it with mass four parts his composition which he had left with me with this slender recommendation i set out for besancon by way geneva where i saw my relations through nion where i saw my father who received me his usual manner promised forward my portmanteau which as i travelled on horseback came after me i arrived at besancon was kindly received by abbe blanchard who promised me his instruction offered his services any other particular we had just set about our music when i received letter from my father informing me that my portmanteau had been seized confiscated at rousses french barrier on side switzerland alarmed at news i employed acquaintance i had formed at besancon learn motive this confiscation being certain there was nothing contraband among my baggage i could not conceive on what pretext it could have been seized on at length however i learned rights story which as it is very curious one must not be omitted i became acquainted at chambery with very worthy old man from lyons named monsieur duvivier who had been employed at visa under regency for want other business now assisted at survey he had lived polite world possessed talents was good humored understood music as we both wrote same chamber we preferred each other s acquaintance that unlicked cubs that surrounded us he had some correspondents at paris who furnished him with those little nothings those daily novelties which circulate one knows not why die one cares not when without any one thinking them longer than they are heard as i sometimes took him dine with madam de warens he some measure treated me with respect wishing render himself agreeable endeavored make me fond these trifles for which i naturally had such distaste that i never my life read any them unhappily one these cursed papers happened be waistcoat pocket new suit which i had only worn two or three times prevent its being seized by commissioners customs this paper contained insipid jansenist parody on that beautiful scene racine s mithridates i had not read ten lines it but by forgetfulness left it my pocket this caused all my necessaries be confiscated commissioners at head inventory my portmanteau set most pompous verbal process which it was taken for granted that this most terrible writing came from geneva for sole purpose being printed distributed france then ran into holy invectives against enemies god church praised pious vigilance those who had prevented execution these most infernal machinations they doubtless found also that my spirits smelt heresy for on strength this dreadful paper they were all seized from that time i never received any account my unfortunate portmanteau revenue officers whom i applied for this purpose required so many instructions informations certificates memorials etc etc that lost thousand times perplexing labyrinth i was glad abandon them entirely i feel real regret for not having preserved this verbal process from office rousses for it was piece calculated hold distinguished rank collection which is accompany this work loss my necessities immediately brought me back chambery without having learned anything abbe blanchard reasoning with myself on events this journey seeing that misfortunes attended all my enterprises i resolved attach myself entirely madam de warens share her fortune distress myself no longer about future events which i could not regulate she received me as if i had brought back treasures replaced by degrees my little wardrobe though this misfortune fell heavy enough on us both it was forgotten almost as suddenly as it arrived though this mischance had rather dampened my musical ardor i did not leave off studying my rameau by repeated efforts was at length able understand it make some little attempts at composition success which encouraged me proceed count de bellegarde son marquis antremont had returned from dresden after death king augustus having long resided at paris he was fond music particularly that rameau his brother count nangis played on violin countess la tour their sister sung tolerably this rendered music fashion at chambery kind public concert was established there direction which was at first designed for me but they soon discovered i was not competent undertaking it was otherwise arranged notwithstanding this i continued writing number little pieces my own way among others cantata which gained great approbation it could not indeed be called finished piece but airs were written style novelty produced good effect which was not expected from me these gentlemen could not believe that reading music so indifferently it was possible i should compose any that was passable made no doubt that i had taken myself credit some other person s labors monsieur de nangis wishing be assured this called on me one morning with cantata clerambault s which he had transposed as he said suit his voice which another bass was necessary transposition having rendered that clerambault impracticable i answered it required considerable labor could not be done on spot being convinced i only sought excuse he pressed me write at least bass recitative i did so not well doubtless because attempt anything with success i must have both time freedom but i did it at least according rule he being present could not doubt but i understood elements composition i did not therefore lose my scholars though it hurt my pride that there should be concert at chambery which i was not necessary about this time peace being concluded french army repassed alps several officers came visit madam de warens among others count de lautrec colonel regiment orleans since plenipotentiary geneva afterwards marshal france whom she presented me on her recommendation he appeared interest himself greatly my behalf promising great deal which he never remembered till last year his life when i no longer stood need his assistance young marquis sennecterre whose father was then ambassador at turin passed through chambery at same time dined one day at m de menthon s when i happened be among guests after dinner discourse turned on music which marquis understood extremely well opera jephtha was then new he mentioned this piece it was brought him he made me tremble by proposing execute it between us he opened book at that celebrated double chorus la terra l enfer le ciel meme tout tremble devant le seigneur earth hell heaven itself tremble before lord he said how many parts will you take i will do these six i had not yet been accustomed this trait french vivacity though acquainted with divisions could not comprehend how one man could undertake perform six or even two parts at same time nothing has cost me more trouble music than skip lightly from one part another have eye at once on whole division by manner which i evaded this trial he must have been inclined believe i did not understand music perhaps it was satisfy himself this particular that he proposed my noting song for mademoiselle de menthon such manner that i could not avoid it he sang this song i wrote from his voice without giving him much trouble repeat it when finished he read my performance said which was very true that it was very correctly noted he had observed my embarrassment now seemed enhance merit this little success reality i then understood music very well only wanted that quickness at first sight which i possess no one particular which is only be acquired this art by long constant practice be that as it may i was fully sensible his kindness endeavoring efface from minds others even from my own embarrassment i had experienced on this occasion twelve or fifteen years afterwards meeting this gentleman at several houses paris i was tempted make him recollect this anecdote show him i still remembered it but he had lost his sight since that time i feared give him pain by recalling his memory how useful it formerly had been him was therefore silent on that subject i now touch on moment that binds my past existence present some friendships that period prolonged present time being very dear me have frequently made me regret that happy obscurity when those who called themselves my friends were really so loved me for myself through pure good will not from vanity being acquainted with conspicuous character perhaps for secret purpose finding more occasions injure him from this time i date my first acquaintance with my old friend gauffecourt who notwithstanding every effort disunite us has still remained so still remained so no alas i have just lost him but his affection terminated only with his life death alone could put period our friendship monsieur de gauffecourt was one most amiable men that ever existed it was impossible see him without affection or live with him without feeling sincere attachment my life i never saw features more expressive goodness serenity or that marked more feeling more understanding or inspired greater confidence however reserved one might be it was impossible even at first sight avoid being as free with him as if he had been acquaintance twenty years for myself who find so much difficulty be at ease among new faces i was familiar with him moment his manner accent conversation perfectly suited his features sound his voice was clear full musical it was agreeable expressive bass which satisfied ear sounded full upon heart it was impossible possess more equal pleasing vivacity or more real unaffected gracefulness more natural talents or cultivated with greater taste join all these good qualities affectionate heart but loving rather too diffusively bestowing his favors with too little caution serving his friends with zeal or rather making himself friend every one he could serve yet contriving very dexterously manage his own affairs while warmly pursuing interests others gauffecourt was son clock maker would have been clock maker himself had not his person desert called him superior situation he became acquainted with m de la closure french resident at geneva who conceived friendship for him procured him some connections at paris which were useful through whose influence he obtained privilege furnishing salts valais which was worth twenty thousand livres year this very amply satisfied his wishes with respect fortune but with regard women he was more difficult he had provide for his own happiness did what he supposed most conducive it what renders his character most remarkable does him greatest honor is that though connected with all conditions he was universally esteemed sought after without being envied or hated by any one i really believe he passed through life without single enemy happy man he went every year baths aix where best company from neighboring countries resorted being on terms friendship with all nobility savoy came from aix chambery see young count de bellegarde his father marquis antremont it was here madam de warens introduced me him this acquaintance which appeared at that time end nothing after many years had elapsed was renewed on occasion which i should relate when it became real friendship i apprehend i am sufficiently authorized speaking man whom i was so firmly attached but i had no personal interest what concerned him he was so truly amiable born with so many natural good qualities that for honor human nature i should think it necessary preserve his memory this man estimable as he certainly was had like other mortals some failings as will be seen hereafter perhaps had it not been so he would have been less amiable since render him as interesting as possible it was necessary he should sometimes act such manner as require small portion indulgence another connection same time that is not yet extinguished continues flatter me with idea temporal happiness which it is so difficult obliterate from human heart is monsieur de conzie savoyard gentleman then young amiable who had fancy learn music or rather be acquainted with person who taught it with great understanding taste for polite acquirements m de conzie possessed mildness disposition which rendered him extremely attractive my temper being somewhat similar when it found counterpart our friendship was soon formed seeds literature philosophy which began ferment my brain only waited for culture emulation spring up found him exactly what was wanting render them prolific m de conzie had no great inclination music even this was useful me for hours destined for lessons were passed anyhow rather than musically we breakfasted chatted read new publications but not word music correspondence between voltaire prince royal prussia then made noise world these celebrated men were frequently subject our conversation one whom recently seated on throne already indicated what he would prove himself hereafter while other as much disgraced as he is now admired made us sincerely lament misfortunes that seemed pursue him which are so frequently appendage superior talents prince prussia had not been happy his youth it appeared that voltaire was formed never be so interest we took both parties extended all that concerned them nothing that voltaire wrote escaped us inclination i felt for these performances inspired me with desire write elegantly caused me endeavor imitate colorings that author with whom i was so much enchanted some time after his philosophical letters though certainly not his best work greatly augmented my fondness for study it was rising inclination which from that time has never been extinguished but moment was not yet arrived when i should give into it entirely my rambling disposition rather contracted than eradicated being kept alive by our manner living at madam de warens which was too unsettled for one my solitary temper crowd strangers who daily swarmed about her from all parts certainty i was that these people sought only dupe her each his particular mode rendered home disagreeable since i had succeeded anet confidence his mistress i had strictly examined her circumstances saw their evil tendency with horror i had remonstrated hundred times prayed argued conjured but all no purpose i had thrown myself at her feet strongly represented catastrophe that threatened her had earnestly entreated that she would reform her expenses begin with myself representing that it was better suffer something while she was yet young than by multiplying her debts creditors expose her old age vexation misery sensible sincerity my zeal she was frequently affected would then make finest promises world but only let artful schemer arrive instant all her good resolutions were forgotten after thousand proofs inefficacy my remonstrances what remained but turn away my eyes from ruin i could not prevent fly myself from door i could not guard i made therefore little journeys geneva lyons which diverted my mind some measure from this secret uneasiness though it increased cause by these additional expenses i can truly aver that i should have acquiesed with pleasure every retrenchment had madam de warens really profited by it but being persuaded that what i might refuse myself would be distributed among set interested villains i took advantage her easiness partake with them like dog returning from shambles carried off portion that morsel which i could not protect pretences were not wanting for all these journeys even madam de warens would alone have supplied me with more than were necessary having plenty connections negotiations affairs commissions which she wished have executed by some trusty hand these cases she usually applied me i was always willing go consequently found occasions enough furnish out rambling kind life these excursions procured me some good connections which have since been agreeable or useful me among others i met at lyons with m perrichon whose friendship i accuse myself with not having sufficiently cultivated considering kindness he had for me that good parisot which i shall speak its place at grenoble that madam deybens madam la presidente de bardonanche woman great understanding who would have entertained friendship for me had it been my power have seen her oftener at geneva that m de closure french resident who often spoke me my mother remembrance whom neither death nor time had erased from his heart likewise those two barillots father who was very amiable good companion one most worthy men i ever met calling me his grandson during troubles republic these two citizens took contrary sides son siding with people father with magistrates when they took up arms 1737 i was at geneva saw father son quit same house armed one going townhouse other his quarters almost certain meet face face course two hours prepared give or receive death from each other this unnatural sight made so lively impression on me that i solemnly vowed never interfere any civil war nor assist deciding our internal dispute by arms either personally or by my influence should i ever enter into my rights as citizen i can bring proofs having kept this oath on very delicate occasion it will be confessed at least i should suppose so that this moderation was some worth but i had not yet arrived at that fermentation patriotism which first sight geneva arms has since excited my heart as may be conjectured by very grave fact that will not tell my advantage which i forgot put its proper place but which ought not be omitted my uncle bernard died at carolina where he had been employed some years building charles town which he had formed plan my poor cousin too died prussian service thus my aunt lost nearly at same period her son husband these losses reanimated some measure her affection for nearest relative she had remaining which was myself when i went geneva i reckoned her house my home amused myself with rummaging turning over books papers my uncle had left among them i found some curious ones some letters which they certainly little thought my aunt who set no store by these dusty papers would willingly have given whole me but i contented myself with two or three books with notes written by minister bernard my grandfather among rest posthumous works rohault quarto margins which were full excellent commentaries which gave me inclination mathematics this book remained among those madam de warens i have since lamented that i did not preserve it these i added five or six memorials manuscript printed one composed by famous micheli ducret man considerable talents being both learned enlightened but too much perhaps inclined sedition for which he was cruelly treated by magistrates geneva lately died fortress arberg where he had been confined many years for being as it was said concerned conspiracy berne this memorial was judicious critique on extensive but ridiculous plan fortification which had been adopted at geneva though censured by every person judgment art who was unacquainted with secret motives council execution this magnificent enterprise monsieur de micheli who had been excluded from committee fortification for having condemned this plan thought that as citizen member two hundred he might give his advice at large therefore did so this memorial which he was imprudent enough have printed though he never published it having only those copies struck off which were meant for two hundred which were all intercepted at post house by order senate grand council geneva december 1728 pronounced this paper highly disrespectful councils injurious committee fortification i found this memorial among my uncle s papers with answer he had been ordered make it took both this was soon after i had left my place at survey i yet remained on good terms with counsellor de coccelli who had management it some time after director custom house entreated me stand godfather his child with madam coccelli who was be godmother proud being placed on such terms equality with counsellor i wished assume importance show myself worthy that honor full this idea i thought i could do nothing better than show him micheli s memorial which was really scarce piece would prove i was connected with people consequence geneva who were intrusted with secrets state yet by kind reserve which i should find it difficult account for i did not show him my uncle s answer perhaps because it was manuscript nothing less than print was worthy approach counsellor he understood however so well importance this paper which i had folly put into his hands that i could never after get it into my possession being convinced that every effort for that purpose would be ineffectual i made merit my forbearance transforming theft into present i made no doubt that this writing more curious however than useful answered his purpose at court turin where probably he took care be reimbursed some way or other for expense which acquisition it might be supposed have cost him happily all future contingencies least probable is that ever king sardina should besiege geneva but as that event is not absolutely impossible i shall ever reproach my foolish vanity with having been means pointing out greatest defects that city its most ancient enemy i passed two or three years this manner between music study projects journeys floating incessantly from one object another wishing fix though i knew not on what but insensibly inclining towards study i was acquainted with men letters i had heard them speak literature sometimes mingled conversation yet rather adopted jargon books than knowledge they contained my excursions geneva i frequently called on my good old friend monsieur simon who greatly promoted my rising emulation by fresh news from republic letters extracted from baillet or colomies i frequently saw too at chambery dominican professor physic good kind friar whose name i have forgotten who often made little chemical experiments which greatly amused me imitation him i attempted make some sympathetic ink having for that purpose more than half filled bottle with quicklime orpiment water effervescence immediately became extremely violent i ran unstop bottle but had not time effect it for during attempt it burst my face like bomb i swallowed so much orpiment lime that it nearly cost me my life i remained blind for six weeks by event this experiment learned meddle no more with experimental chemistry while elements were unknown me this adventure happened very unluckily for my health which for some time past had been visibly on decline this was rather extraordinary as i was guilty no kind excess nor could it have been expected from my make for my chest being well formed rather capacious seemed give my lungs full liberty play yet i was short breathed felt very sensible oppression sighed involuntarily had palpitations heart spitting blood accompanied with lingering fever which i have never since entirely overcome how is it possible fall into such state flower one s age without any inward decay or without having done anything destroy health it is sometimes said sword wears scabbard this was truly case with me violence my passions both kept me alive hastened my dissolution what passions will be asked mere nothings most trivial objects nature but which affected me as forcibly as if acquisition helen or throne universe were at stake my senses for instance were at ease with one woman but my heart never was necessities love consumed me very bosom happiness i had tender respected lovely friend but i sighed for mistress my prolific fancy painted her as such gave her thousand forms for had i conceived that my endearments had been lavished on madam de warens they would not have been less tender though infinitely more tranquil but is it possible for man taste their utmost extent delights love i cannot tell but i am persuaded my frail existence would have sunk under weight them i was therefore dying for love without object this state perhaps is all others most dangerous i was likewise uneasy tormented at bad state poor madam de warens circumstances imprudence her conduct which could not fail bring them short time total ruin my tortured imagination which ever paints misfortunes extremity continually beheld this its utmost excess all horror its consequences i already saw myself forced by want quit her whom i had consecrated my future life without whom i could not hope for happiness thus was my soul continually agitated hopes fears devoured me alternately music was passion less turbulent but not less consuming from ardor with which i attached myself it by obstinate study obscure books rameau by invincible resolution charge my memory with rules it could not contain by continual application by long immense compilations which i frequently passed whole nights copying but why dwell on these particularly while every folly that took possession my wandering brain most transient ideas single day journey concert supper walk novel read play see things world least premeditated my pleasures or occupation became for me most violent passions which by their ridiculous impetuosity conveyed most serious torments even imaginary misfortunes cleveland read with avidity frequent interruption have i am persuaded disordered me more than my own there was genevese named bagueret who had been employed under peter great court russia one most worthless senseless fellows i ever met with full projects as foolish as himself which were rain down millions on those who took part them this man having come chambery on account some suit depending before senate immediately got acquainted with madam de warens with great reason on his side since for those imaginary treasures that cost him nothing which he bestowed with utmost prodigality he gained exchange unfortunate crown pieces one by one out her pocket i did not like him he plainly perceived this for with me it is not very difficult discovery nor did he spare any sort meanness gain my good will among other things proposed teaching me play at chess which game he understood something i made attempt though almost against my inclination after several efforts having learned moves my progress was so rapid that before end first sitting i gave him rook which beginning he had given me nothing more was necessary behold me fascinated with chess i buy board with rest apparatus shutting myself up my chamber pass whole days nights studying all varieties game being determined by playing alone without end or relaxation drive them into my head right or wrong after incredible efforts during two or three months passed this curious employment i go coffee house thin sallow almost stupid i seat myself again attack m bagueret he beats me once twice twenty times so many combinations were fermenting my head my imagination was so stupefied that all appeared confusion i tried exercise myself with philidor s or stamina s book instructions but i was still equally perplexed after having exhausted myself with fatigue was further seek than ever whether i abandoned my chess for time or resolved surmount every difficulty by unremitted practice it was same thing i could never advance one step beyond improvement first sitting nay i am convinced that had i studied it thousand ages i should have ended by being able give bagueret rook nothing more it will be said my time was well employed not little it passed this occupation nor did i quit my first essay till unable persist it for on leaving my apartment i had appearance corpse had i continued this course much longer i should certainly have been one any one will allow that it would have been extraordinary especially ardor youth that such head should suffer body enjoy continued health alteration mine had effect on my temper moderating ardor my chimerical fancies for as i grew weaker they became more tranquil i even lost some measure my rage for travelling i was not seized with heaviness but melancholy vapors succeeded passions languor became sorrow i wept sighed without cause felt my life ebbing away before i had enjoyed it i only trembled think situation which i should leave my dear madam de warens i can truly say that quitting her leaving her these melancholy circumstances was my only concern at length i fell quite ill was nursed by her as never mother nursed child care she took me was real utility her affairs since it diverted her mind from schemes kept projectors at distance how pleasing would death have been at that time when if i had not tasted many pleasures life i had felt but few its misfortunes my tranquil soul would have taken her flight without having experienced those cruel ideas injustice mankind which embitters both life death i should have enjoyed sweet consolation that i still survived dearer part myself situation i then was it could hardly be called death had i been divested my uneasiness on her account it would have appeared but gentle sleep yet even these disquietudes had such affectionate tender turn that their bitterness was tempered by pleasing sensibility i said her you are depository my whole being act so that i may be happy two or three times when my disorder was most violent i crept her apartment give her my advice respecting her future conduct i dare affirm these admonitions were both wise equitable which interest i took her future concerns was strongly marked as if tears had been both nourishment medicine i found myself better for those i shed with her while seated on her bed side holding her hands between mine hours crept insensibly away these nocturnal discourses i returned my chamber better than i had quitted it being content calmed by promises she made hopes with which she had inspired me i slept on them with my heart at peace fully resigned dispensations providence god grant that after having had so many reasons hate life after being agitated with so many storms after it has even become burden that death which must terminate all may be no more terrible than it would have been at that moment by inconceivable care vigilance she saved my life i am convinced she alone could have done this i have little faith skill physicians but depend greatly on assistance real friends am persuaded that being easy those particulars on which our happiness depends is more salutary than any other application if there is sensation life peculiarly delightful we experienced it being restored each other our mutual attachment did not increase for that was impossible but it became i know not how more exquisitely tender fresh softness being added its former simplicity i became manner her work we got into habit though without design being continually with each other enjoying some measure our whole existence together feeling reciprocally that we were not only necessary but entirely sufficient for each other s happiness accustomed think no subject foreign ourselves our happiness all our desires were confined that pleasing singular union which perhaps had no equal which is not as i have before observed love but sentiment inexpressibly more intimate neither depending on senses age nor figure but assemblage every endearing sensation that composes our rational existence which can cease only with our being how was it that this delightful crisis did not secure our mutual felicity for remainder her life mine i have consoling conviction that it was not my fault nay i am persuaded she did not wilfully destroy it invincible peculiarity my disposition was doomed soon regain its empire but this fatal return was not suddenly accomplished there was thank heaven short but precious interval that did not conclude by my fault which i cannot reproach myself with having employed amiss though recovered from my dangerous illness i did not regain my strength my stomach was weak some remains fever kept me languishing condition only inclination i was sensible was end my days near one so truly dear me confirm her those good resolutions she had formed convince her what consisted real charms happy life as far as depended on me render hers so but i foresaw that gloomy melancholy house continual solitude our tete tetes would at length become too dull monotonous remedy presented itself madam de warens had prescribed milk for me insisted that i should take it country i consented provided she would accompany me nothing more was necessary gain her compliance whither we should go was all that remained be determined on our garden which i have before mentioned was not properly country being surrounded by houses other gardens possessing none those attractions so desirable rural retreat besides after death anet we had given up this place from economical principles feeling no longer desire rear plants other views making us not regret loss that little retreat improving distaste i found she began imbibe for town i proposed abandon it entirely settle ourselves agreeable solitude some small house distant enough from city avoid perpetual intrusion her hangers on she followed my advice this plan which her good angel mine suggested might fully have secured our happiness tranquility till death had divided us but this was not state we were appointed madam de warens was destined endure all sorrows indigence poverty after having passed former part her life abundance that she might learn quit it with less regret myself by assemblage misfortunes all kinds was become striking example those who inspired with love justice public good trusting too implicitly their own innocence shall openly dare assert truth mankind unsupported by cabals or without having previously formed parties protect them unhappy fear furnished some objections our plan she did not dare quit her ill contrived house for fear displeasing proprietor your proposed retirement is charming said she much my taste but we are necessitated remain here for on quitting this dungeon i hazard losing very means life when these fail us woods we must again return seek them city that we may have least possible cause for being reduced this necessity let us not leave this house entirely but pay small pension count saint laurent that he may continue mine let us seek some little habitation far enough from town be at peace yet near enough return when it may appear convenient this mode was finally adopted after some small search we fixed at charmettes on estate belonging m de conzie at very small distance from chambery but as retired solitary as if it had been hundred leagues off spot we had concluded on was valley between two tolerably high hills which ran north south at bottom among trees pebbles ran rivulet above declivity on either side were scattered number houses forming

higher up hill meadows for cattle short all that could be thought necessary for country retirement we proposed establish best my remembrance we took possession it toward latter end summer 1736 i was delighted on going sleep there oh said i this dear friend embracing her with tears tenderness delight this is abode happiness innocence if we do not find them here together it will be vain seek them elsewhere book vi hoc erat votis modus agri non ita magnus hortus ubi et tecto vicinus aqua fons et paulum sylvae super his foret i cannot add auctius acque di melius fecere but no matter former is enough for my purpose i had no occasion have any property there it was sufficient that i enjoyed it for i have long since both said felt that proprietor possessor are two very different people even leaving husbands lovers out question at this moment began short happiness my life those peaceful rapid moments which have given me right say i have lived precious ever regretted moments ah recommence your delightful course pass more slowly through my memory if possible than you actually did your fugitive succession how shall i prolong according my inclination this recital at once so pleasing simple how shall i continue relate same occurrences without wearying my readers with repetition any more than i was satiated with enjoyment again if all this consisted facts actions or words i could somehow or other convey idea it but how shall i describe what was neither said nor done nor even thought but enjoyed felt without being able particularize any other object my happiness than bare idea i rose with sun was happy i walked was happy i saw madam de warens was happy i quitted her still was happy whether i rambled through woods over hills or strolled along valley read was idle worked garden or gathered fruits happiness continually accompanied me it was fixed on no particular object it was within me nor could i depart from it single moment nothing that passed during that charming epocha nothing that i did said or thought has escaped my memory time that preceded or followed it i only recollect by intervals unequally confused but here i remember all as distinctly as if it existed at this moment imagination which my youth was perpetually anticipating future but now takes retrograde course makes some amends by these charming recollections for deprivation hope which i have lost forever i no longer see anything future that can tempt my wishes it is recollection past alone that can flatter me remembrance period i am now describing is so true lively that it sometimes makes me happy even spite my misfortunes these recollections i shall relate one example which may give some idea their force precision first day we went sleep at charmettes way being up hill madam de warens rather heavy she was carried chair while i followed on foot fearing chairmen would be fatigued she got out about half way designing walk rest it as we passed along she saw something blue hedge said there s some periwinkle flower yet i had never seen any before nor did i stop examine this my sight is too short distinguish plants on ground i only cast look at this as i passed interval near thirty years had elapsed before i saw any more periwinkle at least before i observed it when being at cressier 1764 with my friend m du peyrou we went up small mountain on summit which there is level spot called with reason belle vue i was then beginning herbalize walking looking among bushes i exclaimed with rapture ah there s some periwinkle du peyrou who perceived my transport was ignorant cause but will some day be informed i hope on reading this reader may judge by this impression made by so small incident what effect must have been produced by every occurrence that time meantime air country did not restore my health i was languishing became more so i could not endure milk was obliged discontinue use it water was at this time fashionable remedy for every complaint accordingly i entered on course it so indiscreetly that it almost released me not only from my illness but also from my life water i drank was rather hard difficult pass as water from mountains generally is short i managed so well that course two months i totally ruined my stomach which until that time had been very good no longer digesting anything properly had no reason expect cure at this time accident happened as singular itself as its subsequent consequences which can only terminate with my existence one morning being no worse than usual while putting up leaf small table i felt sudden almost inconceivable revolution throughout my whole frame i know not how describe it better than as kind tempest which suddenly rose my blood spread moment over every part my body my arteries began beating so violently that i not only felt their motion but even heard it particularly that carotids attended by loud noise my ears which was three or rather four distinct kinds for instance first grave hollow buzzing then more distinct murmur like running water then extremely sharp hissing attended by beating i before mentioned whose throbs i could easily count without feeling my pulse or putting hand any part my body this internal tumult was so violent that it has injured my auricular organs rendered me from that time not entirely deaf but hard hearing my surprise fear may easily be conceived imagining it was stroke death i went bed physician being sent for trembling with apprehension i related my case judging it past all cure i believe doctor was same opinion however he performed his office running over long string causes effects beyond my comprehension after which consequence this sublime theory he set about anima vili experimental part his art but means he was pleased adopt order effect cure were so troublesome disgusting followed by so little effect that i soon discontinued it after some weeks finding i was neither better nor worse left my bed returned my usual method living but beating my arteries buzzing my ears has never quitted me moment during thirty years time which has elapsed since that time till now i had been great sleeper but total privation repose with other alarming symptoms which have accompanied it even this time persuaded me i had but short time live this idea tranquillized me for time i became less anxious about cure being persuaded i could not prolong life determined employ remainder it as usefully as possible this was practicable by particular indulgence nature which this melancholy state exempted me from sufferings which it might have been supposed i should have experienced i was incommoded by noise but felt no pain nor was it accompanied by any habitual inconvenience except nocturnal wakefulness at all times shortness breath which is not violent enough be called asthma but was troublesome when i attempted run or use any degree exertion this accident which seemed threaten dissolution my body only killed my passions i have reason thank heaven for happy effect produced by it on my soul i can truly say i only began live when i considered myself as entering grave for estimating at their real value those things i was quitting i began employ myself on nobler objects namely by anticipating those i hoped shortly have contemplation which i had hitherto too much neglected i had often made light religion but was never totally devoid it consequently it cost me less pain employ my thoughts on that subject which is generally thought melancholy though highly pleasing those who make it object hope consolation madam de warens therefore was more useful me on this occasion than all theologians world would have been she who brought everything into system had not failed do as much by religion this system was composed ideas that bore no affinity each other some were extremely good others very ridiculous being made up sentiments proceeding from her disposition prejudices derived from education men general make god like themselves virtuous make him good profligate make him wicked ill tempered bilious devotees see nothing but hell because they would willingly damn all mankind while loving gentle souls disbelieve it altogether one astonishments i could never overcome is see good fenelon speak it his telemachus as if he really gave credit it but i hope he lied that particular for however strict he might be regard truth bishop absolutely must lie sometimes madam de warens spoke truth with me that soul made up without gall who could not imagine revengeful ever angry god saw only clemency forgiveness where devotees bestowed inflexible justice eternal punishment she frequently said there would be no justice supreme being should he be strictly just us because not having bestowed what was necessary render us essentially good it would be requiring more than he had given most whimsical idea was that not believing hell she was firmly persuaded reality purgatory this arose from her not knowing what do with wicked being loathed damn them utterly nor yet caring place them with good till they had become so we must really allow that both this world next wicked are very troublesome company it is clearly seen that doctrine original sin redemption mankind is destroyed by this system consequently that basis christian dispensation as generally received is shaken that catholic faith cannot subsist with these principles madam de warens notwithstanding was good catholic or at least pretended be one certainly desired become such but it appeared her that scriptures were too literally harshly explained supposing that all we read everlasting torments were figurative threatenings death jesus christ example charity truly divine which should teach mankind love god each other word faithful religion she had embraced she acquiesced all its professions faith but on discussion each particular article it was plain she thought diametrically opposite that church whose doctrines she professed believe these cases she exhibited simplicity art frankness more eloquent than sophistry which frequently embarrassed her confessor for she disguised nothing from him i am good catholic she would say will ever remain so i adopt with all powers my soul decisions our holy mother church i am not mistress my faith but i am my will which i submit you without reserve i will endeavor believe all what can you require more had there been no christian morality established i am persuaded she would have lived as if regulated by its principles so perfectly did they seem accord with her disposition she did everything that was required she would have done same had there been no such requisition but all this morality was subordinate principles m tavel or rather she pretended see nothing religion that contradicted them thus she would have favored twenty lovers day without any idea crime her conscience being no more moved that particular than her passions i know that number devotees are not more scrupulous but difference is they are seduced by constitution she was blinded by her sophisms midst conversations most affecting i might say most edifying she would touch on this subject without any change air or manner without being sensible any contradiction her opinions so much was she persuaded that our restrictions on that head are merely political that any person sense might interpret apply or make exceptions them without any danger offending almighty though i was far enough from being same opinion this particular i confess i dared not combat hers indeed as i was situated it would have been putting myself rather awkward circumstances since i could only have sought establish my opinion for others myself being exception besides i entertained but little hopes making her alter hers which never had any great influence on her conduct at time i am speaking none but i have promised faithfully describe her principles i will perform my engagement i now return myself finding her all those ideas i had occasion for secure me from fears death its future consequences i drew confidence security from this source my attachment became warmer than ever i would willingly have transmitted her my whole existence which seemed ready abandon me from this redoubled attachment persuasion that i had but short time live profound security on my future state arose habitual even pleasing serenity which calming every passion that extends our hopes fears made me enjoy without inquietude or concern few days which i imagined remained for me what contributed render them still snore agreeable was endeavor encourage her rising taste for country by every amusement i could possibly devise wishing attach her her garden poultry pigeons cows i amused myself with them these little occupations which employed my time without injuring my tranquillity were more serviceable than milk diet or all remedies bestowed on my poor shattered machine even effecting utmost possible reestablishment it vintage gathering our fruit employed remainder year we became more more attached rustic life society our honest neighbors we saw approach winter with regret returned city as if going into exile me this return was particularly gloomy who never expected see return spring thought i took everlasting leave charmettes i did not quit it without kissing very earth trees casting back many wishful look as i went towards chambery having left my scholars for so long time lost my relish for amusements town i seldom went out conversing only with madam de warens monsieur salomon who had lately become our physician he was honest man good understanding great cartesian spoke tolerably well on system world his agreeable instructive conversations were more serviceable than his prescriptions i could never bear that foolish trivial mode conversation which is so generally adopted but useful instructive discourse has always given me great pleasure nor was i ever backward join it i was much pleased with that m salomon it appeared me that when his company i anticipated acquisition that sublime knowledge which my soul would enjoy when freed from its mortal fetters inclination i had for him extended subjects which he treated on i began look after books which might better enable me understand his discourse those which mingled devotion with science were most agreeable me particularly port royal s oratory i began read or rather devour them one fell into my hands written by father lami called entretiens sur les sciences which was kind introduction knowledge those books it treated i read it over hundred times resolved make this my guide short i found notwithstanding my ill state health that i was irresistibly drawn towards study though looking on each day as last my life read with as much avidity as if certain i was live forever i was assured that reading would injure me but on contrary i am rather inclined think it was serviceable not only my soul but also my body for this application which soon became delightful diverted my thoughts from my disorders i soon found myself much less affected by them it is certain however that nothing gave me absolute ease but having no longer any acute pain i became accustomed languishment wakefulness thinking instead acting short i looked on gradual slow decay my body as inevitably progressive only be terminated by death this opinion not only detached me from all vain cares life but delivered me from importunity medicine which hitherto i had been forced submit though contrary my inclination salomon convinced that his drugs were unavailing spared me disagreeable task taking them contented himself with amusing grief my poor madam de warens by some those harmless preparations which serve flatter hopes patient keep up credit doctor i discontinued strict regimen i had latterly observed resumed use wine lived every respect like man perfect health as far as my strength would permit only being careful run into no excess i even began go out visit my acquaintance particularly m de conzie whose conversation was extremely pleasing me whether it struck me as heroic study my last hour or that some hopes life yet lingered bottom my heart i cannot tell but apparent certainty death far from relaxing my inclination for improvement seemed animate it i hastened acquire knowledge for other world as if convinced i should only possess that portion i could carry with me i took liking shop bookseller whose name was bouchard which was frequented by some men letters as spring whose return i had never expected see again was approaching furnished myself with some books for charmettes case i should have happiness return there i had that happiness enjoyed it utmost extent rapture with which i saw trees put out their first bud is inexpressible return spring seemed me like rising from grave into paradise snow was hardly off ground when we left our dungeon returned charmettes enjoy first warblings nightingale i now thought no more dying it is really singular that from this time i never experienced any dangerous illness country i have suffered greatly but never kept my bed have often said those about me on finding myself worse than ordinary should you see me at point death carry me under shade oak i promise you i shall recover though weak i resumed my country occupations as far as my strength would permit conceived real grief at not being able manage our garden without help for i could not take five or six strokes with spade without being out breath overcome with perspiration when i stooped beating redoubled blood flew with such violence my head that i was instantly obliged stand upright being therefore confined less fatiguing employments i busied myself about dove house was so pleased with it that i sometimes passed several hours there without feeling moment s weariness pigeon is very timid difficult tame yet i inspired mine with so much confidence that they followed me everywhere letting me catch them at pleasure nor could i appear garden without having two or three on my arms or head instant notwithstanding pleasure i took them their company became so troublesome that i was obliged lessen familiarity i have ever taken great pleasure taming animals particularly those that are wild fearful it appeared delightful me inspire them with confidence which i took care never abuse wishing them love me freely i have already mentioned that i purchased some books i did not forget read them but manner more proper fatigue than instruct me i imagined that read book profitably it was necessary be acquainted with every branch knowledge it even mentioned far from thinking that author did not do this himself but drew assistance from other books as he might see occasion full this silly idea i was stopped every moment obliged run from one book another sometimes before i could reach tenth page what i was studying found it necessary turn over whole library i was so attached this ridiculous method that i lost prodigious deal time had bewildered my head such degree that i was hardly capable doing seeing or comprehending anything i fortunately perceived at length that i was wrong road which would entangle me inextricable labyrinth quitted it before i was irrevocably lost when person has any real taste for sciences first thing he perceives pursuit them is that connection by which they mutually attract assist enlighten each other that it is impossible attain one without assistance rest though human understanding cannot grasp all one must ever be regarded as principal object yet if rest are totally neglected favorite study is generally obscure i was convinced that my resolution improve was good useful itself but that it was necessary i should change my method i therefore had recourse encyclopaedia i began by distribution general mass human knowledge into its various branches but soon discovered that i must pursue contrary course that i must take each separately trace it that point where it united with rest thus i returned general synthetical method but returned thither with conviction that i was going right meditation supplied want knowledge very natural reflection gave strength my resolutions which was that whether i lived or died i had no time lose for having learned but little before age five twenty then resolving learn everything was engaging employ future time profitably i was ignorant at what point accident or death might put period my endeavors resolved at all events acquire with utmost expedition some idea every species knowledge as well try my natural disposition as judge for myself what most deserved cultivation execution my plan i experienced another advantage which i had never thought this was spending great deal time profitably nature certainly never meant me for study since attentive application fatigues me so much that i find it impossible employ myself half hour together intently on any one subject particularly while following another person s ideas for it has frequently happened that i have pursued my own for much longer period with success after reading few pages author with close application my understanding is bewildered should i obstinately continue i tire myself no purpose stupefaction seizes me i am no longer conscious what i read but succession various subjects one relieves me from fatigue other without finding respite necessary i can follow them with pleasure i took advantage this observation plan my studies taking care intermingle them such manner that i was never weary it is true that domestic rural concerns furnished many pleasing relaxations but as my eagerness for improvement increased i contrived find opportunities for my studies frequently employing myself about two things at same time without reflecting that both were consequently neglected relating so many trifling details which delight me but frequently tire my reader i make use caution suppress great number though perhaps he would have no idea this if i did not take care inform him it for example i recollect with pleasure all different methods i adopted for distribution my time such manner as produce utmost profit pleasure i may say that portion my life which i passed this retirement though continual ill health was that which i was least idle least wearied two or three months were thus employed discovering bent my genius meantime i enjoyed finest season year spot it rendered delightful charms life whose worth i was so highly sensible such society as free as it was charming if union so perfect extensive knowledge i purposed acquire can be called society it seemed me as if i already possessed improvements i was only pursuit or rather better since pleasure learning constituted great part my happiness i must pass over these particulars which were me height enjoyment but are too trivial bear repeating indeed true happiness is indescribable it is only be felt this consciousness felicity is proportionately more less able we are describe it because it does not absolutely result from concourse favorable incidents but is affection mind itself i am frequently guilty repetitions but should be infinitely more so did i repeat same thing as often as it recurs with pleasure my mind when at length my variable mode life was reduced more uniform course following was nearly distribution time which i adopted i rose every morning before sun passed through neighboring orchard into pleasant path which running by vineyard led towards chambery while walking i offered up my prayers not by vain motion lips but sincere elevation my heart great author delightful nature whose beauties were so charmingly spread out before me i never love pray chamber it seems me that walls all little workmanship man interposed between god myself i love contemplate him his works which elevate my soul raise my thoughts him my prayers were pure i can affirm it therefore worthy be heard i asked for myself her from whom my thoughts were never divided only innocent quiet life exempt from vice sorrow want i prayed that we might die death just partake their lot hereafter for rest it was rather admiration contemplation than request being satisfied that best means obtain what is necessary from giver every perfect good is rather deserve than solicit returning from my walk i lengthened way by taking roundabout path still contemplating with earnestness delight beautiful scenes with which i was surrounded those only objects that never fatigue either eye or heart as i approached our habitation i looked forward see if madam de warens was stirring when i perceived her shutters open i even ran with joy towards house if they were yet shut i went into garden wait their opening amusing myself meantime by retrospection what i had read preceding evening or gardening moment shutter drew back i hastened embrace her frequently half asleep this salute pure as it was affectionate even from its innocence possessed charm which senses can never bestow we usually breakfasted on milk coffee this was time day when we had most leisure when we chatted with greatest freedom these sittings which were usually pretty long have given me fondness for breakfasts i infinitely prefer those england or switzerland which are considered as meal at which all family assemble than those france where they breakfast alone their several apartments or more frequently have none at all after hour or two passed discourse i went my study till dinner beginning with some philosophical work such as logic port royal locke s essays mallebranche leibnitz descartes etc i soon found that these authors perpetually contradict each other formed chimerical project reconciling them which cost me much labor loss time bewildering my head without any profit at length renouncing this idea i adopted one infinitely more profitable which i attribute all progress i have since made notwithstanding defects my capacity for tis certain i had very little for study on reading each author i acquired habit following all his ideas without suffering my own or those any other writer interfere with them or entering into any dispute on their utility i said myself i will begin by laying up stock ideas true or false but clearly conceived till my understanding shall be sufficiently furnished enable me compare make choice those that are most estimable i am sensible this method is not without its inconveniences but it succeeded furnishing me with fund instruction having passed some years thinking after others without reflection almost without reasoning i found myself possessed sufficient materials set about thinking on my own account when journeys business deprived me opportunities consulting books i amused myself with recollecting comparing what i had read weighing every opinion on balance reason frequently judging my masters though it was late before i began exercise my judicial faculties i have not discovered that they had lost their vigor on publishing my own ideas have never been accused being servile disciple or swearing verba magistri from these studies i passed elements geometry for i never went further forcing my weak memory retain them by going same ground hundred hundred times over i did not admire euclid who rather seeks chain demonstration than connection ideas i preferred geometry father lama who from that time became one my favorite authors whose works i yet read with pleasure algebra followed father lama was still my guide when i made some progress i perused father reynaud s science calculation then his analysis demonstrated but i never went far enough thoroughly understand application algebra geometry i was not pleased with this method performing operations by rule without knowing what i was about resolving geometrical problems by help equations seemed like playing tune by turning round handle first time i found by calculation that square binocular figure was composed square each its parts double product one by other though convinced that my multiplication was right i could not be satisfied till i had made examined figure not but i admire algebra when applied abstract quantities but when used demonstrate dimensions i wished see operation unless explained by lines could not rightly comprehend it after this came latin it was my most painful study which i never made great progress i began by port royal s rudiments but without success i lost myself crowd rules studying last forgot all that preceded it study words is not calculated for man without memory it was principally endeavor make my memory more retentive that urged me obstinately persist this study which at length i was obliged relinquish as i understood enough read easy author by aid dictionary i followed that method found it succeed tolerably well i likewise applied myself translation not by writing but mentally by exercise perseverance attained read latin authors easily but have never been able speak or write that language which has frequently embarrassed me when i have found myself i know not by what means enrolled among men letters another inconvenience that arose from this manner learning is that i never understood prosody much less rules versification yet anxious understand harmony language both prose verse i have made many efforts obtain it but am convinced that without master it is almost impossible having learned composition hexameter which is easiest all verses i had patience measure out greater part virgil into feet quantity whenever i was dubious whether syllable was long or short immediately consulted my virgil it may easily be conceived that i ran into many errors consequence those licenses permitted by rules versification it is certain that if there is advantage studying alone there are also great inconveniences inconceivable labor as i have experienced more than any one at twelve i quitted my books if dinner was not ready paid my friends pigeons visit or worked garden till it was when i heard myself called ran very willingly with good appetite partake it for it is very remarkable that let me be ever so indisposed my appetite never fails we dined very agreeably chatting till madam de warens could eat two or three times week when it was fine we drank our coffee cool shady arbor behind house that i had decorated with hops which was very refreshing during heat we usually passed hour viewing our flowers vegetables or conversation relative our manner life which greatly increased pleasure it i had another little family at end garden these were several hives bees which i never failed visit once day was frequently accompanied by madam de warens i was greatly interested their labor amused myself seeing them return hives their little thighs so loaded with precious store that they could hardly walk at first curiosity made me indiscreet they stung me several times but afterwards we were so well acquainted that let me approach as near as i would they never molested me though hives were full bees ready swarm at these times i have been surrounded having them on my hands face without apprehending any danger all animals are distrustful man with reason but when once assured he does not mean injure them their confidence becomes so great that he must be worse than barbarian who abuses it after this i returned my books but my afternoon employment ought rather bear name recreation amusement than labor or study i have never been able bear application after dinner general any kind attention is painful me during heat day i employed myself tis true but without restraint or rule read without studying what i most attended at these times was history geography as these did not require intense application made as much progress them as my weak memory would permit i had inclination study father petau launched into gloom chronology but was disgusted at critical part which i found had neither bottom nor banks this made me prefer more exact measurement time by course celestial bodies i should even have contracted fondness for astronomy had i been possession instruments but was obliged content myself with some elements that art learned from books few rude observations made with telescope sufficient only give me general idea situation heavenly bodies for my short sight is insufficient distinguish stars without help glass i recollect adventure on this subject remembrance which has often diverted me i had bought celestial planisphere study constellations by having fixed it on frame when nights were fine sky clear i went into garden fixing frame on four sticks something higher than myself which i drove into ground turned planisphere downwards contrived light it by means candle which i put pail prevent wind from blowing it out then placed centre above mentioned four supporters this done i examined stars with my glass from time time referring my planisphere endeavored distinguish various constellations i think i have before observed that our garden was on terrace lay open road one night some country people passing very late saw me most grotesque habit busily employed these observations light which struck directly on planisphere proceeding from cause they could not divine candle being concealed by sides pail four stakes supporting large paper marked over with various uncouth figures with motion telescope which they saw turning backwards forwards gave whole air conjuration that struck them with horror amazement my figure was by no means calculated dispel their fears flapped hat put on over my nightcap short cloak about my shoulder which madam de warens had obliged me put on presented their idea image real sorcerer being near midnight they made no doubt but this was beginning some diabolical assembly having no curiosity pry further into these mysteries they fled with all possible speed awakened their neighbors described this most dreadful vision story spread so fast that next day whole neighborhood was informed that nocturnal assembly witches was held garden that belonged monsieur noiret i am ignorant what might have been consequence this rumor if one countrymen who had been witness my conjurations had not same day carried his complaint two jesuits who frequently came visit us who without knowing foundation story undeceived satisfied them these jesuits told us whole affair i acquainted them with cause it which altogether furnished us with hearty laugh however i resolved for future make my observations without light consult my planisphere house those who have read venetian magic letters from mountain may find that i long since had reputation being conjurer such was life i led at charmettes when i had no rural employments for they ever had preference those that did not exceed my strength i worked like peasant but my extreme weakness left me little except will besides as i have before observed i wished do two things at once therefore did neither well i obstinately persisted forcing my memory retain great deal by heart for that purpose i always carried some book with me which while at work i studied with inconceivable labor i was continually repeating something am really amazed that fatigue these vain continual efforts did not render me entirely stupid i must have learned relearned eclogues virgil twenty times over though at this time i cannot recollect single line them i have lost or spoiled great number books by custom i had carrying them with me into dove house garden orchard or vineyard when being busy about something else i laid my book at foot tree on hedge or first place that came hand frequently left them there finding them fortnight after perhaps rotted pieces or eaten by ants or snails this ardor for learning became so far madness that it rendered me almost stupid i was perpetually muttering some passage or other myself writings port royal those oratory being what i most read had made me half jansenist notwithstanding all my confidence their harsh theology sometimes alarmed me dread hell which till then i had never much apprehended by little little disturbed my security had not madam de warens tranquillized my soul would at length have been too much for me my confessor who was hers likewise contributed all his power keep up my hopes this was jesuit named father hemet good wise old man whose memory i shall ever hold veneration though jesuit he had simplicity child his manners less relaxed than gentle were precisely what was necessary balance melancholy impressions made on me by jansenism this good man his companion father coppier came frequently visit us at charmette though road was very rough tedious for men their age these visits were very comfortable me which may almighty return their souls for they were so old that i cannot suppose them yet living i sometimes went see them at chambery became acquainted at their convent had free access library remembrance that happy time is so connected with idea those jesuits that i love one on account other though i have ever thought their doctrines dangerous could never find myself disposition hate them cordially i should like know whether there ever passed such childish notions hearts other men as sometimes do mine midst my studies life as innocent as man could lead notwithstanding every persuasion contrary dread hell frequently tormented me i asked myself what state am i should i die at this instant must i be damned according my jansenists matter was indubitable but according my conscience it appeared quite contrary terrified floating this cruel uncertainty i had recourse most laughable expedient resolve my doubts for which i would willingly shut up any man as lunatic should i see him practise same folly one day meditating on this melancholy subject i exercised myself throwing stones at trunks trees with my usual dexterity that is say without hitting any them height this charming exercise it entered my mind make kind prognostic that might calm my inquietude i said i will throw this stone at tree facing me if i hit my mark i will consider it as sign salvation if i miss as token damnation while i said this i threw stone with trembling hand beating breast but so happily that it struck body tree which truly was not difficult matter for i had taken care choose one that was very large very near me from that moment i never doubted my salvation i know not on recollecting this trait whether i ought laugh or shudder at myself ye great geniuses who surely laugh at my folly congratulate yourselves on your superior wisdom but insult not my unhappiness for i swear you that i feel it most sensibly these troubles these alarms inseparable perhaps from devotion were only at intervals general i was tranquil impression made on my soul by idea approaching death was less that melancholy than peaceful languor which even had its pleasures i have found among my old papers kind congratulation exhortation which i made myself on dying at age when i had courage meet death with serenity without having experienced any great evils either body or mind how much justice was there thought preconception what i had suffer made me fear live it seemed that i dreaded fate which must attend my future days i have never been so near wisdom as during this period when i felt no great remorse for past nor tormenting fear for future reigning sentiment my soul being enjoyment present serious people usually possess lively sensuality which makes them highly enjoy those innocent pleasures that are allowed them worldlings i know not why impute this them as crime or rather i well know cause this imputation it is because they envy others enjoyment those simple pure delights which they have lost relish i had these inclinations found it charming gratify them security conscience my yet inexperienced heart gave all with calm happiness child or rather if i dare use expression with raptures angel for reality these pure delights are as serene as those paradise dinners on grass at montagnole suppers our arbor gathering fruits vintage social meeting with our neighbors all these were so many holidays which madam de warens took as much pleasure as myself solitary walks afforded yet purer pleasure because them our hearts expanded with greater freedom one particularly remains my memory it was on st louis day whose name madam de warens bore we set out together early unattended after having heard mass at break day chapel adjoining our house from carmelite who attended for that purpose as i proposed walking over hills opposite our dwelling which we had not yet visited we sent our provisions on before excursion being last whole day madam de warens though rather corpulent did not walk ill we rambled from hill hill wood wood sometimes sun but oftener shade resting from time time regardless how hours stole away speaking ourselves our union gentleness our fate offering up prayers for its duration which were never heard everything conspired augment our happiness it had rained for several days previous this there was no dust brooks were full rapid gentle breeze agitated leaves air was pure horizon free from clouds serenity reigned sky as our hearts our dinner was prepared at peasant s house shared with him his family whose benedictions we received these poor savoyards are worthiest people after dinner we regained shade while i was picking up bits dried sticks boil our coffee madam de warens amused herself with herbalizing among bushes with flowers i had gathered for her my way she made me remark their construction thousand natural beauties which greatly amused me which ought have given me taste for botany but time was not yet come my attention was arrested by too many other studies besides this idea struck me which diverted my thoughts from flowers plants situation my mind at that moment all that we had said or done that day every object that had struck me brought my remembrance kind waking dream i had at annecy seven or eight years before which i have given account its place similarity was so striking that it affected me even tears transport tenderness i embraced madam de warens my dearest friend said i this day has long since been promised me i can see nothing beyond it my happiness by your means is at its height may it never decrease may it continue as long as i am sensible its value then it can only finish with my life thus happily passed my days more happily as i perceived nothing that could disturb or bring them conclusion not that cause my former uneasiness had absolutely ceased but i saw it take another course which i directed with my utmost care useful objects that remedy might accompany evil madam de warens naturally loved country this taste did not cool while with me by little little she contracted fondness for rustic employments wished make most her land had that particular knowledge which she practised with pleasure not satisfied with what belonged house she hired first field then meadow transferring her enterprising humor objects agriculture instead remaining unemployed house was way becoming complete farmer i was not greatly pleased see this passion increase endeavored all i could oppose it for i was certain she would be deceived that her liberal extravagant disposition would infallibly carry her expenses beyond her profits however i consoled myself by thinking produce could not be useless would at least help her live all projects she could form this appeared least ruinous without regarding it therefore light she did as profitable scheme i considered it as perpetual employment which would keep her from more ruinous enterprises out reach impostors with this idea i ardently wished recover my health strength that i might superintend her affairs overlook her laborers or rather be principal one myself exercise this naturally obliged me take with relaxation it procured me from books study was serviceable my health winter following barillot returning from italy brought me some books among others bontempi la cartella per musica father banchieri these gave me taste for history music for theoretical researches that pleasing art barillot remained some time with us as i had been age some months i determined go geneva following spring demand my mother s inheritance or at least that part which belonged me till it could be ascertained what had become my brother this plan was executed as it had been resolved i went geneva my father met me there for he had occasionally visited geneva long time since without its being particularly noticed though decree that had been pronounced against him had never been reversed but being esteemed for his courage respected for his probity situation his affairs was pretended be forgotten or perhaps magistrates employed with great project that broke out some little time after were not willing alarm citizens by recalling their memory at improper time this instance their former partiality i apprehended that i should meet with difficulties on account having changed my religion but none occurred laws geneva being less harsh that particular than those berne where whoever changes his religion not only loses his freedom but his property my rights however were not disputed but i found my patrimony i know not how reduced very little though it was known almost certainty that my brother was dead yet as there was no legal proof i could not lay claim his share which i left without regret my father who enjoyed it as long as he lived no sooner were necessary formalities adjusted i had received my money some which i expended books than i flew with remainder madam de warens my heart beat with joy during journey moment which i gave money into her hands was me thousand times more delightful than that which gave it into mine she received this with simplicity common great souls who doing similar actions without effort see them without admiration indeed it was almost all expended for my use for it would have been employed same manner had it come from any other quarter my health was not yet re established i decayed visibly was pale as death reduced absolute skeleton beating my arteries was extreme my palpitations were frequent i was sensible continual oppression my weakness became at length so great that i could scarcely move or step without danger suffocation stoop without vertigoes or lift even smallest weight which reduced me most tormenting inaction for man so naturally stirring as myself it is certain my disorder was great measure hypochondriacal vapors is malady common people fortunate situations tears i frequently shed without reason lively alarms i felt on falling leaf or fluttering bird inequality humor calm most pleasing life lassitude which made me weary even happiness carried sensibility extravagance were instance this we are so little formed for felicity that when soul body do not suffer together they must necessarily endure separate inconveniences good state one being almost always injurious happiness other had all pleasure life courted me my weakened frame would not have permitted enjoyment them without my being able particularize real seat my complaint yet decline life after having encountered very serious real evils my body seemed regain its strength as if on purpose encounter additional misfortunes at moment i write this though infirm near sixty overwhelmed with every kind sorrow i feel more ability suffer than i ever possessed for enjoyment when very flower my age bosom real happiness complete me i had mingled little physiology among my other readings i set about studying anatomy considering multitude movement wonderful construction various parts that composed human machine my apprehensions were instantly increased i expected feel mine deranged twenty times day far from being surprised find myself dying was astonished that i yet existed i could not read description any malady without thinking it mine had i not been already indisposed i am certain i should have become so from this study finding every disease symptoms similar mine i fancied i had them all at length gained one more troublesome than any i yet suffered which i had thought myself delivered from this was violent inclination seek cure which it is very difficult suppress when once person begins reading physical books by searching reflecting comparing i became persuaded that foundation my complaint was polypus at heart doctor salomon appeared coincide with idea reasonably this opinion should have confirmed my former resolution considering myself past cure this however was not case on contrary i exerted every power my understanding search remedy for polypus resolving undertake this marvellous cure journey which anet had made montpelier see physical garden there visit monsieur sauvages demonstrator he had been informed that monsieur fizes had cured polypus similar that i fancied myself afflicted with madam de warens recollecting this circumstance mentioned it me nothing more was necessary inspire me with desire consult monsieur fizes hope recovery gave me courage strength undertake journey money from geneva furnished means madam de warens far from dissuading entreated me go behold me therefore without further ceremony set out for montpelier but it was not necessary go so far find cure i was search finding motion horse too fatiguing i had hired chaise at grenoble on entering moirans five or six other chaises arrived rank after mine greater part these were train new married lady called madam du colombier with her was madam de larnage not so young or handsome as former yet not less amiable bride was stop at romans but other lady was pursue her route as far as saint andiol near bridge du st esprit with my natural timidity it will not be conjectured that i was very ready at forming acquaintance with these fine ladies company that attended them but travelling same road lodging at same inns being obliged eat at same table acquaintance seemed unavoidable as any backwardness on my part would have got me character very unsociable being it was formed then even sooner than i desired for all this bustle was by no means convenient person ill health particularly one my humor curiosity renders these vixens extremely insinuating they accomplish their design becoming acquainted with man by endeavoring turn his brain this was precisely what happened me madam du colombier was too much surrounded by her young gallants have any opportunity paying much attention me besides it was not worthwhile as we were separate so short time but madam de larnage less attended than her young friend had provide herself for remainder journey behold me then attacked by madam de larnage adieu poor jean jacques or rather farewell fever vapors polypus all completely vanished when her presence ill state my health was first subject our conversation they saw i was indisposed knew i was going montpelier but my air manner certainly did not exhibit appearance libertine since it was clear by what followed they did not suspect i was going there for reason that carries many that road morning they sent inquire after my health invite me take chocolate with them when i made my appearance asked how i had passed night once according my praiseworthy custom speaking without thought i replied i did not know which answer naturally made them conclude i was fool but on questioning me further examination turned out so far my advantage that i rather rose their opinion i once heard madam du colombier say her friend he is amiable but not sufficiently acquainted with world these words were great encouragement assisted me rendering myself agreeable as we became more familiar it was natural give each other some little account whence we came who we were this embarrassed me greatly for i was sensible that good company among women spirit very name new convert would utterly undo me i know not by what whimsicality i resolved pass for englishman however consequence that determination i gave myself out for jacobite was readily believed they called me monsieur dudding which was name i assumed with my new character cursed marquis torignan who was one company invalid like myself both old ill tempered took it his head begin long conversation with me he spoke king james pretender old court st germain s i sat on thorns whole time for i was totally unacquainted with all these except what little i had picked up account earl hamilton from gazettes however i made such fortunate use little i did know as extricate myself from this dilemma happy not being questioned on english language which i did not know single word company were all very agreeable we looked forward moment separation with regret therefore made snails journeys we arrived one sunday at st marcelein s madam de larnage would go mass i accompanied her had nearly ruined all my affairs for by my modest reserved countenance during service she concluded me bigot conceived very indifferent opinion me as i learned from her own account two days after it required great deal gallantry on my part efface this ill impression or rather madam de larnage who was not easily disheartened determined risk first advances see how i should behave she made several but far from being presuming on my figure i thought she was making sport me full this ridiculous idea there was no folly i was not guilty madam de larnage persisted such caressing behavior that much wiser man than myself could hardly have taken it seriously more obvious her advances were more i was confirmed my mistake what increased my torment i found i was really love with her i frequently said myself sometimes her sighing ah why is not all this real then should i be most fortunate men i am inclined think my stupidity did but increase her resolution make her determined get better it we left madam du colombier at romans after which madam de larnage marquis de torignan myself continued our route slowly most agreeable manner marquis though indisposed rather ill humored was agreeable companion but was not best pleased at seeing lady bestow all her attentions on me while he passed unregarded for madam de larnage took so little care conceal her inclination that he perceived it sooner than i did his sarcasms must have given me that confidence i could not presume take from kindness lady if by surmise which no one but myself could have blundered on i had not imagined they perfectly understood each other were agreed turn my passion into ridicule this foolish idea completed my stupidity making me act most ridiculous part while had i listened feelings my heart i might have been performing one far more brilliant i am astonished that madam de larnage was not disgusted at my folly did not discard me with disdain but she plainly perceived there was more bashfulness than indifference my composition we arrived at valence dinner according our usual custom passed remainder day there we lodged out city at st james inn i shall never forget after dinner madam de larnage proposed walk she knew marquis was no walker consequently this was excellent plan for tete tete which she was predetermined make most while we were walking round city by side moats i entered on long history my complaint which she answered so tender accent frequently pressing my arm which she held her heart that it required all my stupidity not be convinced sincerity her attachment i have already observed that she was amiable love rendered her charming adding all loveliness youth she managed her advances with so much art that they were sufficient have seduced most insensible i was therefore very uneasy circumstances frequently on point making declaration but dread offending her still greater being laughed at ridiculed made table talk complimented on my enterprise by satirical marquis had such unconquerable power over me that though ashamed my ridiculous bashfulness i could not take courage surmount it i had ended history my complaints which i felt ridiculousness at this time not knowing how look or what say continued silent giving finest opportunity world for that ridicule i so much dreaded happily madam de larnage took more favorable resolution suddenly interrupted this silence by throwing her arms round my neck while at same instant her lips spoke too plainly on mine be any longer misunderstood this was reposing that confidence me want which has almost always prevented me from appearing myself for once i was at ease my heart eyes tongue spoke freely what i felt never did i make better reparation for my mistakes if this little conquest had cost madam de larnage some difficulties i have reason believe she did not regret them was i live hundred years i should never forget this charming woman i say charming for though neither young nor beautiful she was neither old nor ugly having nothing her appearance that could prevent her wit accomplishments from producing all their effects it was possible see her without falling love but those she favored could not fail adore her which proves my opinion that she was not generally so prodigal her favors it is true her inclination for me was so sudden lively that it scarce appears excusable though from short but charming interval i passed with her i have reason think her heart was more influenced than her passions our good intelligence did not escape penetration marquis not that he discontinued his usual raillery on contrary he treated me as sighing hopeless swain languishing under rigors his mistress not word smile or look escaped him by which i could imagine he suspected my happiness i should have thought him completely deceived had not madam de larnage who was more clear sighted than myself assured me contrary but he was well bred man it was impossible behave with more attention or greater civility than he constantly paid me notwithstanding his satirical sallies especially after my success which as he was unacquainted with my stupidity he perhaps gave me honor achieving it has already been seen that he was mistaken this particular but no matter i profited by his error for being conscious that laugh was on my side i took all his sallies good part sometimes parried them with tolerable success for proud reputation wit which madam de larnage had thought fit discover me i no longer appeared same man we were both country season plenty had everywhere excellent cheer thanks good cares marquis though i would willingly have relinquished this advantage have been more satisfied with situation our chambers but he always sent his footman on provide them whether his own accord or by order his master rogue always took care that marquis chamber should be close by madam de larnage s while mine was at further end house but that made no great difference or perhaps it rendered our rendezvous more charming this happiness lasted four or five days during which time i was intoxicated with delight which i tasted pure serene without any alloy advantage i could never boast before i may add it is owing madam de larnage that i did not go out world without having tasted real pleasure if sentiment i felt for her was not precisely love it was at least very tender return what she testified for me our meetings were so delightful that they possessed all sweets love without that kind delirium which affects brain even tends diminish our happiness i never experienced true love but once my life that was not with madam de larnage neither did i feel that affection for her which i had been sensible yet continued possess for madam de warens but for this very reason our tete tetes were hundred times more delightful when with madam de warens my felicity was always disturbed by secret sadness compunction heart which i found it impossible surmount instead being delighted at acquisition so much happiness i could not help reproaching myself for contributing render her i loved unworthy on contrary with madam de lamage i was proud my happiness gave it without repugnance while my triumph redoubled every other charm i do not recollect exactly where we quitted marquis who resided this country but i know we were alone on our arrival at montelimar where madam de larnage made her chambermaid get into my chaise accommodate me with seat hers it will easily be believed that travelling this manner was by no means displeasing me that i should be very much puzzled give any account country we passed through she had some business at montelimar which detained her there two or three days during this time she quitted me but one quarter hour for visit she could not avoid which embarrassed her with number invitations she had no inclination accept therefore excused herself by pleading some indisposition though she took care this should not prevent our walking together every day most charming country under finest sky imaginable oh these three days what reason have i regret them never did such happiness return again amours journey cannot be very durable it was necessary we should part i must confess it was almost time not that i was weary my happiness but i might as well have been we endeavored comfort each other for pain parting by forming plans for our reunion it was concluded that after staying five or six weeks at montpelier which would give madam de larnage time prepare for my reception such manner as prevent scandal i should return saint andiol spend winter under her direction she gave me ample instruction on what it was necessary i should know on what it would be proper say how i should conduct myself she spoke much earnestly on care my health conjured me consult skilful physicians be attentive exact following their prescriptions whatever they might happen be i believe her concern was sincere for she loved me gave proofs her affection less equivocal than prodigality her favors for judging by my mode travelling that i was not very affluent circumstances though not rich herself on our parting she would have had me share contents her purse which she had brought pretty well furnished from grenoble it was with great difficulty i could make her put up with denial word we parted my heart full her idea leaving hers if i am not mistaken firm attachment me while pursuing remainder my journey remembrance ran over everything that had passed from commencement it i was well satisfied at finding myself alone comfortable chaise where i could ruminate at ease on pleasures i had enjoyed those which awaited my return i only thought saint andiol life i was lead there i saw nothing but madam de larnage or what related her whole universe besides was nothing me even madam de warens was forgotten i set about combining all details by which madam de larnage had endeavored give me advance idea her house neighborhood her connections manner life finding everything charming she had daughter whom she had often described warmest terms maternal affection this daughter was fifteen lively charming amiable disposition madam de larnage promised me her friendship i had not forgotten that promise was curious know how mademoiselle de larnage would treat her mother s bon ami these were subjects my reveries from bridge st esprit remoulin i had been advised visit pont du gard hitherto i had seen none remaining monuments roman magnificence i expected find this worthy hands by which it was constructed for once reality surpassed my expectation this was only time my life it ever did so romans alone could have produced that effect view this noble sublime work struck me more forcibly from being midst desert where silence solitude render majestic edifice more striking admiration more lively for though called bridge it is nothing more than aqueduct one cannot help exclaiming what strength could have transported these enormous stones so far from any quarry what motive could have united labors so many millions men place that no one inhabited i remained here whole hours most ravishing contemplation returned pensive thoughtful my inn this reverie was by no means favorable madam de larnage she had taken care forewarn me against girls montpelier but not against pont du gard it is impossible provide for every contingency on my arrival at nismes i went see amphitheatre which is far more magnificent work than even pont du gard yet it made much less impression on me perhaps because my admiration had been already exhausted on former object or that situation latter midst city was less proper excite it this vast superb circus is surrounded by small dirty houses while yet smaller dirtier fill up area such manner that whole produces unequal confused effect which regret indignation stifle pleasure surprise amphitheatre at verona is vast deal smaller less beautiful than that at nismes but preserved with all possible care neatness by which means alone it made much stronger more agreeable impression on me french pay no regard these things respect no monument antiquity ever eager undertake they never finish nor preserve anything that is already finished their hands i was so much better had gained such appetite by exercise that i stopped whole day at pont du lunel for sake good entertainment company this being deservedly esteemed at that time best inn europe for those who kept it knowing how make its fortunate situation turn advantage took care provide both abundance variety it was really curious find lonely country house table every day furnished with sea fresh water fish excellent game choice wines served up with all attention care which are only be expected among great or opulent all this for thirty five sous each person but pont du lunel did not long remain on this footing for proprietor presuming too much on its reputation at length lost it entirely during this journey i really forgot my complaints but recollected them again on my arrival at montpelier my vapors were absolutely gone but every other complaint remained though custom had rendered them less troublesome they were still sufficient make any one who had been suddenly seized with them suppose himself attacked by some mortal disease effect they were rather alarming than painful made mind suffer more than body though it apparently threatened latter with destruction while my attention was called off by vivacity my passions i paid no attention my health but as my complaints were not altogether imaginary i thought them seriously when tumult had subsided recollecting salutary advice madam de larnage cause my journey i consulted most famous practitioners particularly monsieur fizes through superabundance precaution boarded at doctor s who was irishman named fitz morris this person boarded number young gentlemen who were studying physic what rendered his house very commodious for invalid he contented himself with moderate pension for provisions lodging etc took nothing his boarders for attendance as physician he even undertook execute orders m fizes endeavored re establish my health he certainly acquitted himself very well this employment as regimen indigestions were not be gained at his table though i am not much hurt at privations that kind objects comparison were so near that i could not help thinking with myself sometimes that m de torignan was much better provider than m fitz morris notwithstanding as there was no danger dying with hunger all youths were gay good humored i believe this manner living was really serviceable prevented my falling into those languors i had latterly been so subject i passed morning taking medicines particularly i know not what kind waters but believe they were those vals writing madam de larnage for correspondence was regularly kept up rousseau kindly undertook receive these letters for his good friend dudding at noon i took walk canourgue with some our young boarders who were all very good lads after this we assembled for dinner when this was over affair importance employed greater part us till night this was going little way out town take our afternoon s collation make up two or three parties at mall or mallet as i had neither strength nor skill i did not play myself but i betted on game interested for success my wager followed players their balls over rough stony roads procuring by this means both agreeable salutary exercise we took our afternoon s refreshment at inn out city i need not observe that these meetings were extremely merry but should not omit that they were equally innocent though girls house were very pretty m fitz morris who was great mall player himself was our president i must observe notwithstanding imputation wildness that is generally bestowed on students that i found more virtuous dispositions among these youths than could easily be found among equal number men they were rather noisy than fond wine more merry than libertine i accustomed myself so much this mode life it accorded so entirely with my humor that i should have been very well content with continuance it several my fellow boarders were irish from whom i endeavored learn some english words as precaution for saint andiol time now drew near for my departure every letter madam de larnage wrote she entreated me not delay it at length i prepared obey her i was convinced that physicians who understood nothing my disorder looked on my complaint as imaginary treated me accordingly with their waters whey this respect physicians philosophers differ widely from theologians admitting truth only what they can explain making their knowledge measure possibilities these gentlemen understood nothing my illness therefore concluded i could not be ill who would presume doubt profound skill physician i plainly saw they only meant amuse make me swallow my money judging their substitute at saint andiol would do me quite as much service be infinitely more agreeable i resolved give her preference full therefore this wise resolution i quitted montpelier i set off towards end november after stay six weeks or two months that city where i left dozen louis without either my health or understanding being better for it except from short course anatomy begun under m fitz morris which i was soon obliged abandon from horrid stench bodies he dissected which i found it impossible endure not thoroughly satisfied my own mind on rectitude this expedition as i advanced towards bridge st esprit which was equally road saint andiol chambery i began reflect on madam de warens remembrance whose letters though less frequent than those from madam de larnage awakened my heart remorse that passion had stifled first part my journey but which became so lively on my return that setting just estimate on love pleasure i found myself such situation mind that i could listen wholly voice reason besides continuing act part adventurer i might be less fortunate than i had been beginning for it was only necessary that all saint andiol there should be one person who had been england or who knew english or anything their language prove me impostor family madam de larnage might not be pleased with me would perhaps treat me unpolitely her daughter too made me uneasy for spite myself i thought more her than was necessary i trembled lest i should fall love with this girl that very fear had already half done business was i going return for mother s kindness seek ruin daughter sow dissension dishonor scandal hell itself her family very idea struck me with horror i took firmest resolution combat vanquish this unhappy attachment should i be so unfortunate as experience it but why expose myself this danger how miserable must situation be live with mother whom i should be weary sigh for daughter without daring make known my affection what necessity was there seek this situation expose myself misfortunes affronts remorse for sake pleasures whose greatest charm was already exhausted for i was sensible this attachment had lost its first vivacity with these thoughts were mingled reflections relative my situation duty that good generous friend who already loaded with debts would become more so from foolish expenses i was running into whom i was deceiving so unworthily this reproach at length became so keen that it triumphed over every temptation on approaching bridge st esprit i formed resolution burn my whole magazine letters from saint andiol continue my journey right forward chambery i executed this resolution courageously with some sighs i confess but with heart felt satisfaction which i enjoyed for first time my life saying i merit my own esteem know how prefer duty pleasure this was first real obligation i owed my books since these had taught me reflect compare after virtuous principles i had so lately adopted after all rules wisdom honor i had proposed myself felt so proud follow shame possessing so little stability contradicting so egregiously my own maxims triumphed over allurements pleasure perhaps after all pride had as much share my resolution as virtue but if this pride is not virtue itself its effects are so similar that we are pardonable deceiving ourselves one advantage resulting from good actions is that they elevate soul disposition attempting still better for such is human weakness that we must place among our good deeds abstinence from those crimes we are tempted commit no sooner was my resolution confirmed than i became another man or rather i became what i was before i had erred saw its true colors what intoxication moment had either concealed or disguised full worthy sentiments wise resolutions i continued my journey intending regulate my future conduct by laws virtue dedicate myself without reserve that best friends whom i vowed as much fidelity future as i felt real attachment sincerity this return virtue appeared promise better destiny but mine alas was fixed already begun even at very moment when my heart full good virtuous sentiments was contemplating only innocence happiness through life i touched on fatal period that was draw after it long chain my misfortunes my impatience arrive at chambery had made me use more diligence than i meant do i had sent letter from valence mentioning day hour i should arrive but i had gained half day on this calculation which time i passed at chaparillan that i might arrive exactly at time i mentioned i wished enjoy its full extent pleasure seeing her preferred deferring this happiness little that expectancy might increase value it this precaution had always succeeded hitherto my arrival had caused little holiday i expected no less this time these preparations so dear me would have been well worth trouble contriving them i arrived then exactly at hour while at considerable distance looked forward with expectancy seeing her on road meet me beating my heart increased as i drew near house at length i arrived quite out breath for i had left my chaise town i see no one garden at door or at windows i am seized with terror fearful that some accident has happened i enter all is quiet laborers are eating their luncheon kitchen far from observing any preparation servants seem surprised see me not knowing i was expected i go up stairs at length see her that dear friend so tenderly truly entirely beloved i instantly ran towards her threw myself at her feet ah child said she art thou returned then embracing me at same time have you had good journey how do you do this reception amused me for some moments i then asked whether she had received my letter she answered yes i should have thought not replied i information concluded there young man was with her at this time i recollected having seen him house before my departure but at present he seemed established there short he was so i found my place already supplied this young man came from country vaud his father named vintzenried was keeper prison or as he expressed himself captain castle chillon this son captain was journeyman peruke maker gained his living that capacity when he first presented himself madam de warens who received him kindly as she did all comers particularly those from her own country he was tall fair silly youth well enough made with unmeaning face mind same description speaking always like beau comedy mingling manners customs his former situation with long history his gallantry success naming according his account not above half marchionesses who had favored him pretending never have dressed head pretty woman without having likewise decorated her husband s vain foolish ignorant insolent such was worthy substitute taken my absence companion offered me on my return o if souls disengaged from their terrestrial bonds yet view from bosom eternal light what passes here below pardon dear respectable shade that i show no more favor your failings than my own but equally unveil both i ought will be just you as myself but how much less will you lose by this resolution than i shall how much do your amiable gentle disposition your inexhaustible goodness heart your frankness other amiable virtues compensate for your foibles if subversion reason alone can be called such you had errors but not vices your conduct was reprehensible but your heart was ever pure new comer had shown himself zealous exact all her little commissions which were ever numerous he diligently overlooked laborers as noisy insolent as i was quiet forbearing he was seen or rather heard at plough hay loft wood house stable farm yard at same instant he neglected gardening this labor being too peaceful moderate his chief pleasure was load or drive cart saw or cleave wood he was never seen without hatchet or pick axe his hand running knocking hallooing with all his might i know not how many men s labor he performed but he certainly made noise enough for ten or dozen at least all this bustle imposed on poor madam de warens she thought this young man treasure willing attach him herself employed means she imagined necessary for that purpose not forgetting what she most depended on surrender her person those who have thus far read this work should be able form some judgment my heart its sentiments were most constant sincere particularly those which had brought me back chambery what sudden complete overthrow was this my whole being but judge fully this reader must place himself for moment my situation i saw all future felicity i had promised myself vanish moment all charming ideas i had indulged so affectionately disappear entirely i who even from childhood had not been able consider my existence for moment as separate from hers for first time saw myself utterly alone this moment was dreadful those that succeeded it were ever gloomy i was yet young but pleasing sentiments enjoyment hope which enliven youth were extinguished from that hour my existence seemed half annihilated i contemplated advance melancholy remains insipid life if at any time image happiness glanced through my mind it was not that which appeared natural me i felt that even should i obtain it i must still be wretched i was so dull apprehension my confidence her was so great that notwithstanding familiar tone new comer which i looked on as effect easy disposition madam de warens which rendered her free with everyone i never should have suspected his real situation had not she herself informed me it but she hastened make this avowal with freedom calculated inflame me with resentment could my heart have turned that point speaking this connection as quite immaterial with respect herself she reproached me with negligence care family mentioned my frequent absence as though she had been haste supply my place ah said i my heart bursting with most poignant grief what do you dare inform me is this reward attachment like mine have you so many times preserved my life for sole purpose taking from me all that could render it desirable your infidelity will bring me grave but you will regret my loss she answered with tranquillity sufficient distract me that i talked like child that people did not die from such slight causes that our friendship need be no less sincere nor we any less intimate for that her tender attachment me could neither diminish nor end but with herself word she gave me understand that my happiness need not suffer any decrease from good fortune this new favorite never did purity truth force my attachment her appear more evident never did i feel sincerity honesty my soul more forcibly than at that moment i threw myself at her feet embracing her knees with torrents tears no madam replied i with most violent agitation i love you too much disgrace you thus far too truly share you regret that accompanied first acquisition your favors has continued increase with my affection i cannot preserve them by so violent augmentation it you shall ever have my adoration be worthy it me that is more necessary than all you can bestow it is you o my dearest friend that i resign my rights it is union our hearts that i sacrifice my pleasure rather would i perish thousand times than thus degrade her i love i preserved this resolution with constancy worthy i may say sentiment that gave it birth from this moment i saw this beloved woman but with eyes real son it should be remarked here that this resolve did not meet her private approbation as i too well perceived yet she never employed least art make me renounce it either by insinuating proposals caresses or any those means which women so well know how employ without exposing themselves violent censure which seldom fail succeed reduced seek fate independent hers not able devise one i passed other extreme placing my happiness so absolutely her that i became almost regardless myself ardent desire see her happy at any rate absorbed all my affections it was vain she endeavored separate her felicity from mine i felt i had part it spite every impediment thus those virtues whose seeds my heart begun spring up with my misfortunes they had been cultivated by study only waited fermentation adversity become prolific first fruit this disinterested disposition was put from my heart every sentiment hatred envy against him who had supplanted me i even sincerely wished attach myself this young man form educate him make him sensible his happiness if possible render him worthy it word do for him what anet had formerly done for me but similarity dispositions was wanting more insinuating enlightened than anet i possessed neither his coolness fortitude nor commanding strength character which i must have had order succeed neither did young man possess those qualities which anet found me such as gentleness gratitude above all knowledge want his instructions ardent desire render them useful all these were wanting person i wished improve saw me nothing but importunate chattering pedant while on contrary he admired his own importance house measuring services he thought he rendered by noise he made looking on his saws hatchets pick axes as infinitely more useful than all my old books perhaps this particular he might not be altogether blamable but he gave himself number airs sufficient make anyone die with laughter with peasants he assumed airs country gentleman presently he did as much with me at length with madam de warens herself his name vintzenried did not appear noble enough he therefore changed it that monsieur de courtilles by latter appellation he was known at chambery maurienne where he married at length this illustrious personage gave himself such airs consequence that he was everything house myself nothing when i had misfortune displease him he scolded madam de warens fear exposing her his brutality rendered me subservient all his whims so that every time he cleaved wood office which he performed with singular pride it was necessary i should be idle spectator admirer his prowess this lad was not however bad disposition he loved madam de warens indeed it was impossible do otherwise nor had he any aversion even me when he happened be out his airs would listen our admonitions frankly own he was fool yet notwithstanding these acknowledgements his follies continued same proportion his knowledge was so contracted his inclinations so mean that it was useless reason almost impossible be pleased with him not content with most charming woman he amused himself with old red haired toothless waiting maid whose unwelcome service madam de warens had patience endure though it was absolutely disgusting i soon perceived this new inclination was exasperated at it but i saw something else which affected me yet more made deeper impression on me than anything had hitherto done this was visible coldness behavior madam de warens towards me privation i had imposed on myself which she affected approve is one those affronts which women scarcely ever forgive take most sensible most philosophic female one least attached pleasure slighting her favors if within your reach will be found most unpardonable crime even though she may care nothing for man this rule is certainly without exception since sympathy so natural ardent was impaired her by abstinence founded only on virtue attachment esteem i no longer found with her that union hearts which constituted all happiness mine she seldom sought me but when we had occasion complain this new comer for when they were agreed i enjoyed but little her confidence at length was scarcely ever consulted her affairs she seemed pleased indeed with my company but had i passed whole days without seeing her she would hardly have missed me insensibly i found myself desolate alone that house where i had formerly been very soul where if i may so express myself i had enjoyed double life by degrees i accustomed myself disregard everything that passed even those who dwelt there avoid continual mortifications i shut myself up with my books or else wept sighed unnoticed woods this life soon became insupportable i felt that presence woman so dear me while estranged from her heart increased my unhappiness was persuaded that ceasing see her i should feel myself less cruelly separated i resolved therefore quit house mentioned it her she far from opposing my resolution approved it she had acquaintance at grenoble called madam de deybens whose husband was on terms friendship with monsieur malby chief provost lyons m deybens proposed my educating m malby s children i accepted this offer departed for lyons without causing almost without feeling least regret at separation bare idea which few months before would have given us both most excruciating torments i had almost as much knowledge as was necessary for tutor flattered myself that my method would be unexceptionable but year i passed at m malby s was sufficient undeceive me that particular natural gentleness my disposition seemed calculated for employment if hastiness had not been mingled with it while things went favorably i saw pains which i did not spare succeed i was angel but devil when they went contrary if my pupils did not understand me i was hasty when they showed any symptoms untoward disposition i was so provoked that i could have killed them which behavior was not likely render them either good or wise i had two under my care they were very different tempers st marie who was between eight nine years old had good person quick apprehension was giddy lively playful mischievous but his mischief was ever good humored younger one named condillac appeared stupid fretful was headstrong as mule seemed incapable instruction it may be supposed that between both i did not want employment yet with patience temper i might have succeeded but wanting both i did nothing worth mentioning my pupils profited very little i could only make use three means which are very weak often pernicious with children namely sentiment reasoning passion i sometimes exerted myself so much with st marie that i could not refrain from tears wished excite similar sensations him as if it was reasonable suppose child could be susceptible such emotions sometimes i exhausted myself reasoning as if persuaded he could comprehend me as he frequently formed very subtle arguments concluded he must be reasonable because he bid fair be so good logician little condillac was still more embarrassing for he neither understood answered nor was concerned at anything he was obstinacy beyond belief was never happier than when he had succeeded putting me rage then indeed he was philosopher i child i was conscious all my faults studied tempers my pupils became acquainted with them but where was use seeing evil without being able apply remedy my penetration was unavailing since it never prevented any mischief everything i undertook failed because all i did effect my designs was precisely what i ought not have done i was not more fortunate what had only reference myself than what concerned my pupils madam deybens recommending me her friend madam de malby had requested her form my manners endeavor give me air world she took some pains on this account wishing teach me how do honors house but i was so awkward bashful stupid that she found it necessary stop there this however did not prevent me from falling love with her according my usual custom i even behaved such manner that she could not avoid observing it but i never durst declare my passion as lady never seemed humor make advances i soon became weary my sighs ogling being convinced they answered no manner purpose i had quite lost my inclination for little thieveries while with madam de warens indeed as everything belonged me there was nothing steal besides elevated notions i had imbibed ought have rendered me future above such meanness generally speaking they certainly did so but this rather proceeded from my having learned conquer temptations than having succeeded rooting out propensity i should even now greatly dread stealing as my infancy were i yet subject same inclinations i had proof this at m malby s when though surrounded by number little things that i could easily have pilfered which appeared no temptation i took it into my head covert some white arbois wine some glasses which i had drank at table thought delicious it happened be rather thick as i fancied myself excellent finer wine i mentioned my skill this was accordingly trusted my care but attempting mend i spoiled it though sight only for it remained equally agreeable taste profiting by this opportunity i furnished myself from time time with few bottles drink my own apartment but unluckily i could never drink without eating difficulty lay therefore procuring bread it was impossible make reserve this article have it brought by footman was discovering myself insulting master house i could not bear purchase it myself how could fine gentleman with sword at his side enter baker s shop buy small loaf bread it was utterly impossible at length i recollected thoughtless saying great princess who on being informed that country people had no bread replied then let them eat pastry yet even this resource was attended with difficulty i sometimes went out alone for this very purpose running over whole city passing thirty pastry cook s shops without daring enter any one them first place it was necessary there should be only one person shop that person s physiognomy must be so encouraging as give me confidence pass threshold but when once dear little cake was procured i shut up my chamber with that bottle wine taken cautiously from bottom cupboard how much did i enjoy drinking my wine reading few pages novel for when i have no company i always wish read while eating it seems substitute for society i dispatch alternately page morsel tis indeed as if my book dined with me i was neither dissolute nor sottish never my whole life having been intoxicated with liquor my little thefts were not very indiscreet yet they were discovered bottles betrayed me though no notice was taken it i had no longer management cellar all this monsieur malby conducted himself with prudence politeness being really very deserving man who under manner as harsh as his employment concealed real gentleness disposition uncommon goodness heart he was judicious equitable what would not be expected from officer marechausse very humane sensible his indulgence i became greatly attached him which made my stay at lyons longer than it would otherwise have been but at length disgusted with employment which i was not calculated for situation great confinement consequently disagreeable me after year s trial during which time i spared no pains fulfill my engagement i determined quit my pupils being convinced i should never succeed educating them properly monsieur malby saw this as clearly as myself though i am inclined think he would never have dismissed me had i not spared him trouble which was excess condescension this particular that i certainly cannot justify what rendered my situation yet more insupportable was comparison i was continually drawing between life i now led that which i had quitted remembrance my dear charmettes my garden trees fountain orchard but above all company her who was born give life soul every other enjoyment on calling mind our pleasures innocent life i was seized with such oppressions heaviness heart as deprived me power performing anything as it should be hundred times was i tempted instantly set off on foot my dear madam de warens being persuaded that could i once more see her i should be content die that moment fine i could no longer resist tender emotions which recalled me back her whatever it might cost me i accused myself not having been sufficiently patient complaisant kind concluding i might yet live happily with her on terms tender friendship by showing more for her than i had hitherto done i formed finest projects world burned execute them left all renounced everything departed fled arriving all transports my early youth found myself once more at her feet alas i should have died there with joy had i found her reception her embrace or her heart one quarter what i had formerly found there which i yet found undiminished warmth fearful illusions transitory things how often dost thou torment us vain she received me with that excellence heart which could only die with her but i sought influence there which could never be recalled had hardly been half hour with her before i was once more convinced that my former happiness had vanished forever that i was same melancholy situation which i had been obliged fly from yet without being able accuse any person with my unhappiness for courtilles really was not blame appearing see my return with more pleasure than dissatisfaction but how could i bear be secondary person with her whom i had been everything who could never cease being such me how could i live alien that house where i had been child sight every object that had been witness my former happiness rendered comparison yet more distressing i should have suffered less any other habitation for this incessantly recalled such pleasing remembrances that it was irritating recollection my loss consumed with vain regrets given up most gloomy melancholy i resumed custom remaining alone except at meals shut up with my books i sought give some useful diversion my ideas feeling imminent danger want which i had so long dreaded i sought means prepare for receive it when madam de warens should have no other resource i had placed her household on footing not become worse but since my departure everything had been altered he who now managed her affairs was spendthrift wished make great appearance such as keeping good horse with elegant trappings loved appear gay eyes neighbors was perpetually undertaking something he did not understand her pension was taken up advance her rent was arrears debts every kind continued accumulate i could plainly foresee that her pension would be seized perhaps suppressed short i expected nothing but ruin misfortune moment appeared approach so rapidly that i already felt all its horrors my closet was my only amusement after tedious search for remedies for sufferings my mind i determined seek some against evil distressing circumstances which i daily expected would fall upon us returning my old chimeras behold me once more building castles air relieve this dear friend from cruel extremities into which i saw her ready fall i did not believe myself wise enough shine republic letters or stand any chance making fortune by that means new idea therefore inspired me with that confidence which mediocrity my talents could not impart ceasing teach music i had not abandoned thoughts it on contrary i had studied theory sufficiently consider myself well informed on subject when reflecting on trouble it had cost me read music great difficulty i yet experienced singing at sight i began think fault might as well arise from manner noting as from my own dulness being sensible it was art which most people find difficult understand by examining formation signs i was convinced they were frequently very ill devised i had before thought marking gamut by figures prevent trouble having lines draw on noting plainest air but had been stopped by difficulty octaves by distinction measure quantity this idea returned again my mind on careful revision it i found difficulties by no means insurmountable i pursued it successfully was at length able note any music whatever by figures with greatest exactitude simplicity from this moment i supposed my fortune made ardor sharing it with her whom i owed everything thought only going paris not doubting that on presenting my project academy it would be adopted with rapture i had brought some money from lyons i augmented this stock by sale my books course fortnight my resolution was both formed executed short full magnificent ideas it had inspired which were common me on every occasion i departed from savoy with my new system music as i had formerly done from turin with my heron fountain such have been errors faults my youth i have related history them with fidelity which my heart approves if my riper years were dignified with some virtues i should have related them with same frankness it was my intention have done this but i must forego this pleasing task stop here time which renders justice characters most men may withdraw veil should my memory reach posterity they may one day discover what i had say they will then understand why i am now silent book vii after two years silence patience notwithstanding my resolutions i again take up my pen reader suspend your judgment as reasons which force me such step these you can be no judge until you shall have read my book my peaceful youth has been seen pass away calmly agreeably without any great disappointments or remarkable prosperity this mediocrity was mostly owing my ardent yet feeble nature less prompt undertaking than easy discourage quitting repose for violent agitations but returning it from lassitude inclinations which placing me idle tranquil state for which alone i felt i was born at distance from paths great virtues still further from those great vices never permitted me arrive at anything great either good or bad what different account will i soon have give myself fate which for thirty years forced my inclinations for thirty others has seemed oppose them this continued opposition between my situation inclinations will appear have been source enormous faults unheard misfortunes every virtue except that fortitude which alone can do honor adversity history first part my life was written from memory is consequently full errors as i am obliged write second part from memory also errors it will probably be still more numerous agreeable remembrance finest portion my years passed with so much tranquillity innocence has left my heart thousand charming impressions which i love incessantly call my recollection it will soon appear how different from these those rest my life have been recall them my mind would be renew their bitterness far from increasing that my situation by these sorrowful reflections i repel them as much as possible this endeavor often succeed so well as be unable find them at will this facility forgetting my misfortunes is consolation which heaven has reserved me midst those which fate has one day accumulate upon my head my memory which presents me no objects but such as are agreeable is happy counterpoise my terrified imagination by which i foresee nothing but cruel futurity all papers i had collected aid my recollection guide me this undertaking are no longer my possession nor can i ever again hope regain them i have but one faithful guide on which i can depend this is chain sentiments by which succession my existence has been marked by these events which have been either cause or effect manner it i easily forget my misfortunes but i cannot forget my faults still less my virtuous sentiments remembrance these is too dear me ever suffer them be effaced from my mind i may omit facts transpose events fall into some errors dates but i cannot be deceived what i have felt nor that which from sentiment i have done relate this is chief end my present work real object my confessions is communicate exact knowledge what i interiorly am have been every situation my life i have promised history my mind write it faithfully i have no need other memoirs enter into my own heart as i have hitherto done will alone be sufficient there is however very happily interval six or seven years relative which i have exact references collection letters copied from originals hands m du peyrou this collection which concludes 1760 comprehends whole time my residence at hermitage my great quarrel with those who called themselves my friends that memorable epocha my life source all my other misfortunes with respect more recent original letters which may remain my possession are but few number instead transcribing them at end this collection too voluminous enable me deceive vigilance my arguses i will copy them into work whenever they appear furnish any explanation be this either for or against myself for i am not under least apprehension lest reader should forget i make my confession be induced believe i make my apology but he cannot expect i shall conceal truth when it testifies my favor second part it is likewise be remembered contains nothing common with first except truth nor has any other advantage over it but importance facts everything else it is inferior former i wrote first with pleasure with satisfaction at my ease at wootton or castle trie everything i had recollect was new enjoyment i returned my closet with increased pleasure without constraint gave that turn my descriptions which most flattered my imagination at present my head memory are become so weak as render me almost incapable every kind application my present undertaking is result constraint heart full sorrow i have nothing treat but misfortunes treacheries perfidies circumstances equally afflicting i would give world could i bury obscurity time every thing i have say which spite myself i am obliged relate i am at same time under necessity being mysterious subtle endeavoring impose descending things most foreign my nature ceiling under which i write has eyes walls my chamber have ears surrounded by spies by vigilant malevolent inspectors disturbed my attention diverted i hastily commit paper few broken sentences which i have scarcely time read still less correct i know that notwithstanding barriers which are multiplied around me my enemies are afraid truth should escape by some little opening what means can i take introduce it world this however i attempt with but few hopes success reader will judge whether or not such situation furnishes means agreeable descriptions or giving them seductive coloring i therefore inform such as may undertake read this work that nothing can secure them from weariness prosecution their task unless it be desire becoming more fully acquainted with man whom they already know sincere love justice truth my first part i brought down my narrative my departure with infinite regret for paris leaving my heart at charmettes there building my last castle air intending some day return feet mamma restored herself with treasures i should have acquired depending upon my system music as upon certain fortune i made some stay at lyons visit my acquaintance procure letters recommendation paris sell my books geometry which i had brought with me i was well received by all whom i knew m madam de malby seemed pleased see me again several times invited me dinner at their house i became acquainted with abbe de malby as i had already done with abbe de condillac both whom were on visit their brother abbe de malby gave me letters paris among others one m de pontenelle another comte de caylus these were very agreeable acquaintances especially first whose friendship for me his death only put period from whom our private conversations i received advice which i ought have more exactly followed i likewise saw m bordes with whom i had been long acquainted who had frequently obliged me with greatest cordiality most real pleasure he it was who enabled me sell my books he also gave me from himself good recommendations paris i again saw intendant for whose acquaintance i was indebted m bordes who introduced me duke de richelieu who was then passing through lyons m pallu presented me duke received me well invited me come see him at paris i did so several times although this great acquaintance which i shall frequently have occasion speak was never most trifling utility me i visited musician david who one my former journeys my distress had rendered me service he had either lent or given me cap pair stockings which i have never returned nor has he ever asked me for them although we have since that time frequently seen each other i however made him present something like equivalent i would say more upon this subject were what i have owned question but i have speak what i have done which unfortunately is far from being same thing i also saw noble generous perrichon not without feeling effects his accustomed munificence for he made me same present he had previously done elegant bernard by paying for my place diligence i visited surgeon parisot best most benevolent men as also his beloved godefroi who had lived with him ten years whose merit chiefly consisted her gentle manners goodness heart it was impossible see this woman without pleasure or leave her without regret nothing better shows inclinations man than nature his attachments unless he be deceived his choice or that she whom he attaches himself changes her character by extraordinary concurrence causes which is not absolutely impossible were this consequence be admitted without modification socrates must be judged by his wife xantippe dion by his friend calippus which would be most false iniquitous judgment ever made however let no injurious application be here made my wife she is weak more easily deceived than i at first imagined but by her pure excellent character she is worthy all my esteem those who had once seen gentle godefroi immediately knew good amiable parisot i was much obliged all these good people but i afterwards neglected them all not from ingratitude but from that invincible indolence which so often assumes its appearance remembrance their services has never been effaced from my mind nor impression they made from my heart but i could more easily have proved my gratitude than assiduously have shown them exterior that sentiment exactitude correspondence is what i never could observe moment i began relax shame embarrassment repairing my fault made me aggravate it i entirely desist from writing i have therefore been silent appeared forget them parisot perrichon took not least notice my negligence i ever found them same but twenty years afterwards it will be seen m bordes what degree self love wit can make him carry his vengeance when he feels himself neglected before i leave lyons i must not forget amiable person whom i again saw with more pleasure than ever who left my heart most tender remembrance this was mademoiselle serre whom i have spoken my first part i renewed my acquaintance with her whilst i was at m de malby s being this time more at leisure i saw her more frequently she made most sensible impressions on my heart i had some reason believe her own was not unfavorable my pretensions but she honored me with her confidence so far as remove from me all temptation allure her partiality she had no fortune this respect exactly resembled myself our situations were too similar permit us become united with views i then had i was far from thinking marriage she gave me understand that young merchant one m geneve seemed wish obtain her hand i saw him once or twice at her lodgings he appeared me be honest man this was his general character persuaded she would be happy with him i was desirous he should marry her which he afterwards did that i might not disturb their innocent love i hastened my departure offering up for happiness that charming woman prayers which here below were not long heard alas her time was very short for i afterwards heard she died second or third year after her marriage my mind during journey was wholly absorbed tender regret i felt since that time when these circumstances have been present my recollection have frequently done same that although sacrifices made virtue our duty may sometimes be painful we are well rewarded by agreeable remembrance they leave deeply engraven our hearts i this time saw paris as favorable point view as it had appeared me unfavorable one at my first journey not that my ideas its brilliancy arose from splendor my lodgings for consequence address given me by m bordes i resided at hotel st quentin rue des cordiers near sorbonne vile street miserable hotel wretched apartment but nevertheless house which several men merit such as gresset bordes abbe malby condillac several others whom unfortunately i found not one had taken up their quarters but i there met with m bonnefond man unacquainted with world lame litigious who affected be purist him i owe acquaintance m roguin at present oldest friend i have by whose means i became acquainted with diderot whom i shall soon have occasion say good deal i arrived at paris autumn 1741 with fifteen louis my purse with my comedy narcissus my musical project my pocket these composed my whole stock consequently i had not much time lose before i attempted turn latter some advantage i therefore immediately thought making use my recommendations young man who arrives at paris with tolerable figure announces himself by his talents is sure be well received this was my good fortune which procured me some pleasure without leading anything solid all persons whom i was recommended three only were useful me m damesin gentleman savoy at that time equerry i believe favorite princess carignan m de boze secretary academy inscriptions keeper medals king s cabinet father castel jesuit author clavecin oculaire ocular harpsichord all these recommendations except that m damesin were given me by abbe de malby m damesin provided me with that which was most needful by means two persons with whom he brought me acquainted one was m gase president mortier parliament bordeaux who played very well upon violin other abbe de leon who then lodged sorbonne young nobleman extremely amiable who died flower his age after having for few moments made figure world under name chevalier de rohan both these gentlemen had inclination learn composition this i gave them lessons for few months by which means my decreasing purse received some little aid abbe leon conceived friendship for me wished me become his secretary but he was far from being rich all salary he could offer me was eight hundred livres which with infinite regret i refused since it was insufficient defray expenses my lodging food clothing i was well received by m de boze he had thirst for knowledge which he possessed not little but was somewhat pedantic madam de boze much resembled him she was lively affected i sometimes dined with them it is impossible be more awkward than i was her presence her easy manner intimidated me rendered mine more remarkable when she presented me plate i modestly put forward my fork take one least bits what she offered me which made her give plate her servant turning her head aside that i might not see her laugh she had not least suspicion that head rustic with whom she was so diverted there was some small portion wit m de boze presented me m de reaumur his friend who came dine with him every friday day on which academy sciences met he mentioned him my project desire i had having it examined by academy m de reaumur consented make proposal his offer was accepted on day appointed i was introduced presented by m de reaumur on same day august 22d 1742 i had honor read academy memoir i had prepared for that purpose although this illustrious assembly might certainly well be expected inspire me with awe i was less intimidated on this occasion than i had been presence madam de boze i got tolerably well through my reading answers i was obliged give memoir was well received acquired me some compliments by which i was equally surprised flattered imagining that before such assembly whoever was not member it could not have commonsense persons appointed examine my system were m mairan m hellot m de fouchy all three men merit but not one them understood music at least not enough composition enable them judge my project during my conference with these gentlemen i was convinced with no less certainty than surprise that if men learning have sometimes fewer prejudices than others they more tenaciously retain those they have however weak or false most their objections were although i answered them with great timidity i confess bad terms yet with decisive reasons i never once made myself understood or gave them any explanation least satisfactory i was constantly surprised at facility with which by aid few sonorous phrases they refuted without having comprehended me they had learned i know not where that monk name souhaitti had formerly invented mode noting gamut by ciphers sufficient proof that my system was not new this might perhaps be case for although i had never heard father souhaitti notwithstanding his manner writing seven notes without attending octaves was not under any point view worthy entering into competition with my simple commodious invention for easily noting by ciphers every possible kind music keys rests octaves measure time length note things on which souhaitti had never thought it was nevertheless true that with respect elementary expression seven notes he was first inventor but besides their giving this primitive invention more importance than was due it they went still further whenever they spoke fundamental principles system talked nonsense greatest advantage my scheme was supersede transpositions keys so that same piece music was noted transposed at will by means change single initial letter at head air these gentlemen had heard from music masters paris that method executing by transposition was bad one on this authority converted most evident advantage my system into invincible objection against it affirmed that my mode notation was good for vocal music but bad for instrumental instead concluding as they ought have done that it was good for vocal still better for instrumental on their report academy granted me certificate full fine compliments amidst which it appeared that reality it judged my system be neither new nor useful i did not think proper ornament with such paper work entitled dissertation sur la musique moderne by which i appealed public i had reason remark on this occasion that even with narrow understanding sole but profound knowledge thing is preferable for purpose judging it all lights resulting from cultivation sciences when these particular study that question has not been joined only solid objection my system was made by rameau i had scarcely explained it him before he discovered its weak part your signs said he are very good inasmuch as they clearly simply determine length notes exactly represent intervals show simple double note which common notation does not do but they are objectionable on account their requiring operation mind which cannot always accompany rapidity execution position our notes continued he is described eye without concurrence this operation if two notes one very high other very low be joined by series intermediate ones i see at first glance progress from one other by conjoined degrees but your system perceive this series i must necessarily run over your ciphers one after other glance eye is here useless objection appeared me insurmountable i instantly assented it although it be simple striking nothing can suggest it but great knowledge practice art it is by no means astonishing that not one academicians should have thought it but what creates much surprise is that these men great learning who are supposed possess so much knowledge should so little know that each ought confine his judgment that which relates study with which he has been conversant my frequent visits literati appointed examine my system other academicians gave me opportunity becoming acquainted with most distinguished men letters paris by this means acquaintance that would have been consequence my sudden admission amongst them which afterwards came pass was already established with respect present moment absorbed my new system music i obstinately adhered my intention effecting revolution art by that means acquiring celebrity which fine arts is paris mostly accompanied by fortune i shut myself my chamber labored three or four months with inexpressible ardor forming into work for public eye memoir i had read before academy difficulty was find bookseller take my manuscript this on account necessary expenses for new characters because booksellers give not their money by handfuls young authors although me it seemed but just my work should render me bread i had eaten while employed its composition bonnefond introduced me quillau father with whom i agreed divide profits without reckoning privilege which i paid whole expense such were future proceedings this quillau that i lost expenses my privilege never having received farthing from that edition which probably had but very middling success although abbe des fontaines promised give it celebrity notwithstanding other journalists had spoken it very favorably greatest obstacle making experiment my system was fear case its not being received losing time necessary learn it this i answered that my notes rendered ideas so clear that learn music by means ordinary characters time would be gained by beginning with mine prove this by experience i taught music gratis young american lady mademoiselle des roulins with whom m roguin had brought me acquainted three months she read every kind music by means my notation sung at sight better than i did myself any piece that was not too difficult this success was convincing but not known any other person would have filled journals with detail but with some talents for discovering useful things i never have possessed that setting them off advantage thus was my airy castle again overthrown but this time i was thirty years age paris where it is impossible live for trifle resolution i took upon this occasion will astonish none but those by whom first part these memoirs has not been read with attention i had just made great fruitless efforts was need relaxation instead sinking with despair i gave myself up quietly my indolence care providence better wait for its assistance with patience i lay down frugal plan for slow expenditure few louis which still remained my possession regulating expense my supine pleasures without retrenching it going coffee house but every other day theatre but twice week with respect expenses girls easy virtue i had no retrenchment make never having whole course my life applied so much as farthing that use except once which i shall soon have occasion speak security voluptuousness confidence with which i gave myself up this indolent solitary life which i had not means continuing for three months is one singularities my life oddities my disposition extreme desire i had public should think me was precisely what discouraged me from showing myself necessity paying visits rendered them such degree insupportable that i ceased visiting academicians other men letters with whom i had cultivated acquaintance marivaux abbe malby fontenelle were almost only persons whom i sometimes went see first i showed my comedy narcissus he was pleased with it had goodness make it some improvements diderot younger than these was much about my own age he was fond music knew it theoretically we conversed together he communicated me some his literary projects this soon formed betwixt us more intimate connection which lasted fifteen years which probably would still exist were not i unfortunately by his own fault same profession with himself it would be impossible imagine what manner i employed this short precious interval which still remained me before circumstances forced me beg my bread learning by memory passages from poets which i had learned forgotten hundred times every morning at ten o clock i went walk luxembourg with virgil rousseau my pocket there until hour dinner i passed away time restoring my memory sacred ode or bucolic without being discouraged by forgetting by study morning what i had learned evening before i recollected that after defeat nicias at syracuse captive athenians obtained livelihood by reciting poems homer use i made this erudition ward off misery was exercise my happy memory by learning all poets by rote i had another expedient not less solid game chess which i regularly dedicated at maugis evenings on which i did not go theatre i became acquainted with m de legal m husson philidor all great chess players day without making least improvement game however i had no doubt but end i should become superior them all this my own opinion was sufficient resource same manner reasoning served me every folly which i felt myself inclined i said myself whoever excels anything is sure acquire distinguished reception society let us therefore excel no matter what i shall certainly be sought after opportunities will present themselves my own merit will do rest this childishness was not sophism my reason it was that my indolence dismayed at great rapid efforts which would have been necessary call forth my endeavors i strove flatter my idleness by arguments suitable purpose veiled from my own eyes shame such state i thus calmly waited for moment when i was be without money had not father castel whom i sometimes went see my way coffee house roused me from my lethargy i believe i should have seen myself reduced my last farthing without least emotion father castel was madman but good man upon whole he was sorry see me thus impoverish myself no purpose since musicians learned said he do not sing by your scale change string apply women you will perhaps succeed better with them i have spoken you madam de beuzenval go her from me she is good woman who will be glad see countryman her son husband you will find at her house madam de broglie her daughter who is woman wit madam dupin is another whom i also have mentioned you carry her your work she is desirous seeing you will receive you well no thing is done paris without women they are curves which wise are asymptotes they incessantly approach each other but never touch after having from day day delayed these very disagreeable steps i at length took courage called upon madam de beuzenval she received me with kindness madam de broglio entering chamber she said her daughter this is m rousseau whom father castel has spoken us madam de broglie complimented me upon my work going her harpsichord proved me she had already given it some attention perceiving it be about one o clock i prepared take my leave madam de beuzenval said me you are at great distance from quarter town which you reside stay dine here i did not want asking second time quarter hour afterwards i understood by word that dinner which she had invited me was that her servants hall madam de beuzenval was very good kind woman but confined understanding too full her illustrious polish nobility she had no idea respect due talents on this occasion likewise she judged me by my manner rather than by my dress which although very plain was very neat by no means announced man dine with servants i had too long forgotten way place where they eat be inclined take it again without suffering my anger appear i told madam de beuzenval that i had affair trifling nature which i had just recollected obliged me return home i immediately prepared depart madam de broglie approached her mother whispered her ear few words which had their effect madam de beuzenval rose prevent me from going said i expect that you will do us honor dine with us this case i thought show pride would be mark folly i determined stay goodness madam de broglie had besides made impression upon me rendered her interesting my eyes i was very glad dine with her hoped that when she knew me better she would not regret having procured me that honor president de lamoignon very intimate family dined there also he as well as madam de broglie was master all modish fashionable small talk jargon paris poor jean jacques was unable make figure this way i had sense enough not pretend it was silent happy would it have been for me had i always possessed same wisdom i should not be abyss into which i am now fallen i was vexed at my own stupidity at being unable justify madam de broglie what she had done my favor after dinner i thought my ordinary resource i had my pocket epistle verse written parisot during my residence at lyons this fragment was not without some fire which i increased by my manner reading made them all three shed tears whether it was vanity or really truth i thought eyes madam de broglie seemed say her mother well mamma was i wrong telling you this man was fitter dine with us than with your women until then my heart had been rather burdened but after this revenge i felt myself satisfied madam de broglie carrying her favorable opinion me rather too far thought i should immediately acquire fame paris become favorite with fine ladies guide my inexperience she gave me confessions count de this book said she is mentor which you will stand need great world you will do well by sometimes consulting it i kept book upwards twenty years with sentiment gratitude her from whose hand i had received it although i frequently laughed at opinion lady seemed have my merit gallantry from moment i had read work i was desirous acquiring friendship author my inclination led me right he is only real friend i ever possessed amongst men letters i have so long been same opinion so perfectly convinced its being well founded that since my return paris i confided him manuscript my confessions suspicious j j never suspected perfidy falsehood until he had been their victim from this time i thought i might depend on services madam baroness beuzenval marchioness broglie that they would not long leave me without resource this i was not deceived but i must now speak my first visit madam dupin which produced more lasting consequences madam dupin was as every one paris knows daughter samuel bernard madam fontaine there were three sisters who might be called three graces madam de la touche who played little prank went england with duke kingston madam darby eldest three friend only sincere friend prince conti adorable woman as well by her sweetness goodness her charming character as by her agreeable wit incessant cheerfulness lastly madam dupin more beautiful than either her sisters only one who has not been reproached with some levity conduct she was reward hospitality m dupin whom her mother gave her marriage with place farmer general immense fortune return for good reception he had given her his province when i saw her for first time she was still one finest women paris she received me at her toilette her arms were uncovered her hair dishevelled her combing cloth ill arranged this scene was new me it was too powerful for my poor head i became confused my senses wandered short i was violently smitten by madam dupin illustration 0268 my confusion was not prejudicial me she did not perceive it she kindly received book author spoke with information my plan sung accompanied herself on harpsichord kept me dinner placed me at table by her side less than this would have turned my brain i became mad she permitted me visit her i abused permission i went see her almost every day dined with her twice or thrice week i burned with inclination speak but never dared attempt it several circumstances increased my natural timidity permission visit opulent family was door open fortune my situation i was unwilling run risk shutting it against myself madam dupin amiable as she was was serious unanimated i found nothing her manners sufficiently alluring embolden me her house at that time as brilliant as any other paris was frequented by societies less numerous as persons by whom they were composed were chosen on account some distinguished merit she was fond seeing every one who had claims marked superiority great men letters fine women no person was seen her circle but dukes ambassadors blue ribbons princess rohan countess forcalquier madam de mirepoix madam de brignole lady hervey passed for her intimate friends abbes de fontenelle de saint pierre saltier m de fourmont m de berms m de buffon m de voltaire were her circle her dinners if her reserved manner did not attract many young people her society inspired greater awe as it was composed graver persons poor jean jacques had no reason flatter himself he should be able take distinguished part midst such superior talents i therefore had not courage speak but no longer able contain myself i took resolution write for first two days she said not word me upon subject on third day she returned me my letter accompanying it with few exhortations which froze my blood i attempted speak but my words expired upon my lips my sudden passion was extinguished with my hopes after declaration form i continued live with her upon same terms as before without so much as speaking her even by language eyes i thought my folly was forgotten but i was deceived m de francueil son m dupin son law madam dupin was much same with herself me he had wit good person might have pretensions this was said be case probably proceeded from his mother law s having given him ugly wife mild disposition with whom as well as with her husband she lived upon best terms m de francueil was fond talents others cultivated those he possessed music which he understood very well was means producing connection between us i frequently saw him he soon gained my friendship he however suddenly gave me understand that madam dupin thought my visits too frequent begged me discontinue them such compliment would have been proper when she returned my letter but eight or ten days afterwards without any new cause it appeared me ill timed this rendered my situation more singular as m madam de francueil still continued give me same good reception as before i however made intervals between my visits longer i should entirely have ceased calling on them had not madam dupin by another unexpected caprice sent desire i would for few days take care her son who changing his preceptor remained alone during that interval i passed eight days such torments as nothing but pleasure obeying madam dupin could render supportable i would not have undertaken pass eight other days like them had madam dupin given me herself for recompense m de francueil conceived friendship for me i studied with him we began together course chemistry at rouelles that i might be nearer at hand i left my hotel at quentin went lodge at tennis court rue verdelet which leads into rue platiere where m dupin lived there consequence cold neglected i contracted inflammation lungs that had liked have carried me off my younger days i frequently suffered from inflammatory disorders pleurisies especially quinsies which i was very subject which frequently brought me near enough death familiarize me its image during my convalescence i had leisure reflect upon my situation lament my timidity weakness indolence these notwithstanding fire with which i found myself inflamed left me languish inactivity mind continually on verge misery evening preceding day on which i was taken ill i went opera by royer name i have forgotten notwithstanding my prejudice favor talents others which has ever made me distrustful my own i still thought music feeble devoid animation invention i sometimes had vanity flatter myself i think i could do better than that but terrible idea i had formed composition opera importance i heard men profession affix such undertaking instantly discouraged me made me blush at having so much as thought it besides where was i find person write words one who would give himself trouble turning poetry my liking these ideas music opera had possession my mind during my illness delirium my fever i composed songs duets choruses i am certain i composed two or three little pieces di prima infenzione perhaps worthy admiration masters could they have heard them executed oh could account be taken dreams man fever what great sublime things would sometimes proceed from his delirium these subjects music opera still engaged my attention during my convalescence but my ideas were less energetic long frequent meditations which were often involuntary made such impression upon my mind that i resolved attempt both words music this was not first time i had undertaken so difficult task whilst i was at chambery i had composed opera entitled iphis anaxarete which i had good sense throw into fire at lyons i had composed another entitled la decouverte du nouveau monde which after having read it m bordes abbes malby trublet others had met same fate notwithstanding i had set prologue first act music although david after examining composition had told me there were passages it worthy buononcini before i began work i took time consider my plan heroic ballet i proposed three different subjects three acts detached from each other set music different character taking for each subject amours poet i entitled this opera les muses galantes my first act music strongly characterized was tasso second tender harmony ovid third entitled anacreon was partake gayety dithyrambus i tried my skill on first act applied it with ardor which for first time made me feel delightful sensation produced by creative power composition one evening as i entered opera feeling myself strongly incited overpowered by my ideas i put my money again into my pocket returned my apartment locked door having close drawn all curtains that every ray light might be excluded i went bed abandoning myself entirely this musical poetical oestrum seven or eight hours rapidly composed greatest part act i can truly say my love for princess ferrara for i was tasso for moment my noble lofty sentiment with respect her unjust brother procured me night hundred times more delicious than one passed arms princess would have been morning but very little what i had done remained my head but this little almost effaced by sleep lassitude still sufficiently evinced energy pieces which it was scattered remains i this time did not proceed far with my undertaking being interrupted by other affairs whilst i attached myself family dupin madam de beuzenval madam de broglie whom i continued visit had not forgotten me count de montaigu captain guards had just been appointed ambassador venice he was ambassador made by barjac whom he assiduously paid his court his brother chevalier de montaigu gentilhomme de la manche dauphin was acquainted with these ladies with abbe alary french academy whom i sometimes visited madam de broglie having heard ambassador was seeking secretary proposed me him conference was opened between us i asked salary fifty guineas trifle for employment which required me make some appearance ambassador was unwilling give more than thousand livres leaving me make journey at my own expense proposal was ridiculous we could not agree m de francueil who used all his efforts prevent my departure prevailed i stayed m de montaigu set out on his journey taking with him another secretary one m follau who had been recommended him by office foreign affairs they no sooner arrived at venice than they quarrelled follau perceiving he had do with madman left him there m de montaigu having nobody with him except young abbe name binis who wrote under secretary was unfit succeed him had recourse me chevalier his brother man wit by giving me understand there were advantages annexed place secretary prevailed upon me accept thousand livres i was paid twenty louis advance for my journey immediately departed at lyons i would most willingly have taken road mount cenis see my poor mamma but i went down rhone embarked at toulon as well on account war from motive economy as obtain passport from m de mirepoix who then commanded provence whom i was recommended m de montaigu not being able do without me wrote letter after letter desiring i would hasten my journey this however accident considerably prolonged it was at time plague at messina english fleet had anchored there visited felucca on board which i was this circumstance subjected us on our arrival after long difficult voyage quarantine one twenty days passengers had choice performing it on board or lazaretto which we were told was not yet furnished they all chose felucca insupportable heat closeness vessel impossibility walking it vermin with which it swarmed made me at all risks prefer lazaretto i was therefore conducted large building two stories quite empty which i found neither window bed table nor chair not so much as even joint stool or bundle straw my night sack my two trunks being brought me i was shut by great doors with huge locks remained at full liberty walk at my ease from chamber chamber story story everywhere finding same solitude nakedness this however did not induce me repent that i had preferred lazaretto felucca like another robinson crusoe i began arrange myself for my one twenty days just as i should have done for my whole life first place i had amusement destroying vermin i had caught felucca as soon as i had got clear these by means changing my clothes linen i proceeded furnish chamber i had chosen i made good mattress with my waistcoats shirts my napkins i converted by sewing them together into sheets my robe de chambre into counterpane my cloak into pillow i made myself seat with one my trunks laid flat table with other i took out some writing paper inkstand distributed manner library dozen books which i had with me word i so well arranged my few movables that except curtains windows i was almost as commodiously lodged this lazeretto absolutely empty as it was as i had been at tennis court rue verdelet my dinners were served with no small degree pomp they were escorted by two grenadiers with bayonets fixed staircase was my dining room landing place my table steps served me for seat as soon as my dinner was served up little bell was rung inform me i might sit down table between my repasts when i did not either read or write or work at furnishing my apartment i went walk burying ground protestants which served me as courtyard from this place i ascended lanthorn which looked into harbor from which i could see ships come go out this manner i passed fourteen days should have thus passed whole time quarantine without least weariness had not m joinville envoy from france whom i found means send letter vinegared perfumed half burnt procured eight days time be taken off these i went spent at his house where i confess i found myself better lodged than lazaretto he was extremely civil me dupont his secretary was good creature he introduced me as well at genoa as country several families company which i found very entertaining agreeable i formed with him acquaintance correspondence which we kept up for considerable length time i continued my journey very agreeably through lombardy i saw milan verona brescie padua at length arrived at venice where i was impatiently expected by ambassador i found there piles despatches from court from other ambassadors ciphered part which he had not been able read although he had all ciphers necessary for that purpose never having been employed any office nor even seen cipher minister i was at first apprehensive meeting with some embarrassment but i found nothing could be more easy less than week i had deciphered whole which certainly was not worth trouble for not mention little activity required embassy venice it was not such man as m de montaigu that government would confide negotiation even most trifling importance until my arrival he had been much embarrassed neither knowing how dictate nor write legibly i was very useful him which he was sensible he treated me well this he was also induced by another motive since time m de froulay his predecessor whose head became deranged consul from france m le blond had been charged with affairs embassy after arrival m de montaigu continued manage them until he had put him into track m de montaigu hurt at this discharge his duty by another although he himself was incapable it became disgusted with consul as soon as i arrived deprived him functions secretary embassy give them me they were inseparable from title he told me take it as long as i remained with him he never sent any person except myself under this title senate or conference upon whole it was natural enough he should prefer having for secretary embassy man attached him consul or clerk office named by court this rendered my situation very agreeable prevented his gentlemen who were italians as well as his pages most his suite from disputing precedence with me his house i made advantageous use authority annexed title he had conferred upon me by maintaining his right protection that is freedom his neighborhood against attempts several times made infringe it privilege which his venetian officers took no care defend but i never permitted banditti take refuge there although this would have produced me advantages which his excellency would not have disdained partake he thought proper however claim part those secretaryship which is called chancery it was time war there were many passports issued for each these passports sequin was paid secretary who made it out countersigned it all my predecessors had been paid this sequin by frenchmen others without distinction i thought this unjust although i was not frenchman i abolished it favor french but i so rigorously demanded my right from persons every other nation that marquis de scotti brother favorite queen spain having asked for passport without taking notice sequin i sent demand it boldness which vindictive italian did not forget as soon as new regulation i had made relative passports was known none but pretended frenchmen who gibberish most mispronounced called themselves provencals picards or burgundians came demand them my ear being very fine i was not thus made dupe i am almost persuaded that not single italian ever cheated me my sequin that not one frenchman ever paid it i was foolish enough tell m de montaigu who was ignorant everything that passed what i had done word sequin made him open his ears without giving me his opinion abolition that tax upon french he pretended i ought account with him for others promising me at same time equivalent advantages more filled with indignation at this meanness than concern for my own interest i rejected his proposal he insisted i grew warm no sir said i with some heat your excellency may keep what belongs you but do not take from me that which is mine i will not suffer you touch penny perquisites arising from passports perceiving he could gain nothing by these means he had recourse others blushed not tell me that since i had appropriated myself profits chancery it was but just i should pay expenses i was unwilling dispute upon this subject from that time i furnished at my own expense ink paper wax wax candle tape even new seal for which he never reimbursed me amount farthing this however did not prevent my giving small part produce passports abbe de binis good creature who was far from pretending have least right any such thing if he was obliging me my politeness him was equivalent we always lived together on best terms on first trial i made his talents my official functions i found him less troublesome than i expected he would have been considering he was man without experience service ambassador who possessed no more than himself whose ignorance obstinacy constantly counteracted everything with which common sense some information inspired me for his service that king next thing ambassador did was connect himself with marquis mari ambassador from spain ingenious artful man who had he wished so do might have led him by nose yet on account union interests two crowns he generally gave him good advice which might have been essential service had not other by joining his own opinion counteracted it execution only business they had conduct concert with each other was engage venetians maintain their neutrality these did not neglect give strongest assurances their fidelity their engagement at same time that they publicly furnished ammunition austrian troops even recruits under pretense desertion m de montaigu who i believe wished render himself agreeable republic failed not on his part notwithstanding my representation make me assure government all my despatches that venetians would never violate article neutrality obstinacy stupidity this poor wretch made me write act extravagantly i was obliged be agent his folly because he would have it so but he sometimes rendered my employment insupportable functions it almost impracticable for example he insisted on greatest part his despatches king those minister being written cipher although neither them contained anything that required that precaution i represented him that between friday day despatches from court arrived saturday on which ours were sent off there was not sufficient time write so much cipher carry on considerable correspondence with which i was charged for same courier he found admirable expedient which was prepare on thursday answer despatches we were expected receive on next day this appeared him so happily imagined that notwithstanding all i could say on impossibility thing absurdity attempting its execution i was obliged comply during whole time i afterwards remained with him after having made notes few loose words he spoke me course week some trivial circumstances which i collected by hurrying from place place provided with these materials i never once failed carrying him on thursday morning rough draft despatches which were be sent off on saturday excepting few additions corrections i hastily made answer letters which arrived on friday which ours served for answer he had another custom diverting enough which made his correspondence ridiculous beyond imagination he sent back all information its respective source instead making it follow its course m amelot he transmitted news court m maurepas that paris m d havrincourt news from sweden m de chetardie that from petersbourg sometimes each those news they had respectively sent him which i was employed dress up terms different from those which it was conveyed us as he read nothing what i laid before him except despatches for court signed those other ambassadors without reading them this left me more at liberty give what turn i thought proper latter these therefore i made articles information cross each other but it was impossible for me do same by despatches importance i thought myself happy when m de montaigu did not take it into his head cram into them impromptu few lines after his manner this obliged me return hastily transcribe whole despatch decorated with his new nonsense honor it with cipher without which he would have refused his signature i was frequently almost tempted for sake his reputation cipher something different from what he had written but feeling that nothing could authorize such deception i left him answer for his own folly satisfying myself with having spoken him with freedom discharged at my own peril duties my station this is what i always did with uprightness zeal courage which merited on his part very different recompense from that which end i received from him it was time i should once be what heaven which had endowed me with happy disposition what education that had been given me by best women that i had given myself had prepared me for i became so left my own reflections without friend or advice without experience foreign country service foreign nation surrounded by crowd knaves who for their own interest avoid scandal good example endeavored prevail upon me imitate them far from yielding their solicitations i served france well which i owed nothing ambassador still better as it was right just i should do utmost my power irreproachable post sufficiently exposed censure i merited obtained esteem republic that all ambassadors with whom we were correspondence affection french who resided at venice not even excepting consul whom with regret i supplanted functions which i knew belonged him which occasioned me more embarrassment than they afforded me satisfaction m de montaigu confiding without reserve marquis mari who did not thoroughly understand his duty neglected it such degree that without me french who were at venice would not have perceived that ambassador from their nation resided there always put off without being heard when they stood need his protection they became disgusted no longer appeared his company or at his table which indeed he never invited them i frequently did from myself what it was his duty have done i rendered french who applied me all services my power any other country i should have done more but on account my employment not being able see persons place i was often obliged apply consul consul who was settled country with his family had many persons oblige which prevented him from acting as he otherwise would have done however perceiving him unwilling afraid speak i ventured hazardous measures which sometimes succeeded i recollect one which still makes me laugh no person would suspect it was me lovers theatre at paris owe coralline her sister camille nothing however can be more true veronese their father had engaged himself with his children italian company after having received two thousand livres for expenses his journey instead setting out for france quietly continued at venice accepted engagement theatre saint luke which coralline child as she still was drew great numbers people duke de greves as first gentleman chamber wrote ambassador claim father daughter m de montaigu when he gave me letter confined his instructions saying voyez cela examine pay attention this i went m blond beg he would speak patrician whom theatre belonged who i believe was named zustinian that he might discharge veronese who had engaged name king le blond whom commission was not very agreeable executed it badly zustinian answered vaguely veronese was not discharged i was piqued at this it was during carnival having taken bahute mask i set out for palace zustinian those who saw my gondola arrive with livery ambassador were lost astonishment venice had never seen such thing i entered caused myself be announced by name una siora maschera as soon as i was introduced i took off my mask told my name senator turned pale appeared stupefied with surprise sir said i him venetian it is with much regret i importune your excellency with this visit but you have your theatre saint luke man name veronese who is engaged service king whom you have been requested but vain give up i come claim him name his majesty my short harangue was effectual i had no sooner left palace than zustinian ran communicate adventure state inquisitors by whom he was severely reprehended veronese was discharged same day i sent him word that if he did not set off within week i would have him arrested he did not wait for my giving him this intimation second time on another occasion i relieved from difficulty solely by my own means almost without assistance any other person captain merchant ship this was one captain olivet from marseilles name vessel i have forgotten his men had quarreled with sclavonians service republic some violence had been committed vessel was under so severe embargo that nobody except master was suffered go on board or leave it without permission he applied ambassador who would hear nothing he had say he afterwards went consul who told him it was not affair commerce that he could not interfere it not knowing what further steps take he applied me i told m de montaigu he ought permit me lay before senate memoir on subject i do not recollect whether or not he consented or that i presented memoir but i perfectly remember that if i did it was ineffectual embargo still continuing i took another method which succeeded i inserted relation affairs one our letters m de maurepas though i had difficulty prevailing upon m de montaigne suffer article pass i knew that our despatches although their contents were insignificant were opened at venice this i had proof by finding articles they contained verbatim gazette treachery which i had vain attempted prevail upon ambassador complain my object speaking affair letter was turn curiosity ministers republic advantage inspire them with some apprehensions induce state release vessel for had it been necessary this effect wait for answer from court captain would have been ruined before it could have arrived i did still more i went alongside vessel make inquiries ship s company i took with me abbe patizel chancellor consulship who would rather have been excused so much were these poor creatures afraid displeasing senate as i could not go on board on account order from states i remained my gondola there took depositions successively interrogating each mariners directing my questions such manner as produce answers which might be their advantage i wished prevail upon patizel put questions take depositions himself which fact was more his business than mine but this he would not consent he never once opened his mouth refused sign depositions after me this step somewhat bold was however successful vessel was released long before answer came from minister captain wished make me present but without being angry with him on that account i tapped him on shoulder saying captain olivet can you imagine that he who does not receive from french his perquisite for passports which he found his established right is man likely sell them king s protection he however insisted on giving me dinner on board his vessel which i accepted took with me secretary spanish embassy m carrio man wit amiable manners partake it he has since been secretary spanish embassy at paris charge des affaires i had formed intimate connection with him after example our ambassadors happy should i have been if when most disinterested manner i did all service i could i had known how introduce sufficient order into all these little details that i might not have served others at my own expense but employments similar that i held which most trifling faults are consequence my whole attention was engaged avoiding all such mistakes as might be detrimental my service i conducted till last moment everything relative my immediate duty with greatest order exactness excepting few errors which forced precipitation made me commit ciphering which clerks m amelot once complained neither ambassador nor any other person had ever least reason reproach me with negligence any one my functions this is remarkable man so negligent as i am but my memory sometimes failed me i was not sufficiently careful private affairs with which i was charged however love justice always made me take loss on myself this voluntarily before anybody thought complaining i will mention but one circumstance this nature it relates my departure from venice i afterwards felt effects it paris our cook whose name was rousselot had brought from france old note for two hundred livres which hairdresser friend his had received from noble venetian name zanetto nani who had had wigs him that amount rousselot brought me note begging i would endeavor obtain payment some part it by way accommodation i knew he knew it also that constant custom noble venetians was when once returned their country never pay debts they had contracted abroad when means are taken force them payment wretched creditor finds so many delays incurs such enormous expenses that he becomes disgusted concludes by giving up his debtor accepting most trifling composition i begged m le blond speak zanetto venetian acknowledged note but did not agree payment after long dispute he at length promised three sequins but when le blond carried him note even these were not ready it was necessary wait this interval happened my quarrel with ambassador i quitted his service i had left papers embassy greatest order but note rousselot was not be found m le blond assured me he had given it me back i knew him be too honest man have least doubt matter but it was impossible for me recollect what i had done with it as zanetto had acknowledged debt i desired m le blond endeavor obtain from him three sequins on giving him receipt for amount or prevail upon him renew note by way duplicate zanetto knowing note be lost would not agree either i offered rousselot three sequins from my own purse as discharge debt he refused them said i might settle matter with creditor at paris whom he gave me address hair dresser having been informed what had passed would either have his note or whole sum for which it was given what my indignation would i have given have found this vexatious paper i paid two hundred livres that my greatest distress this manner loss note produced creditor payment whole sum whereas had it unfortunately for him been found he would have had some difficulty recovering even ten crowns which his excellency zanetto nani had promised pay talents i thought i felt myself for my employment made me discharge functions it with satisfaction except society my friend de carrio that virtuous altuna whom i shall soon have occasion speak innocent recreations place saint mark theatre few visits which we for most part made together my only pleasure was duties my station although these were not considerable especially with aid abbe de binis yet as correspondence was very extensive there was war i was good deal employed i applied business greatest part every morning on days previous departure courier evenings sometimes till midnight rest my time i gave study political professions i had entered upon which i hoped from my successful beginning be advantageously employed fact i was favor with every one ambassador himself spoke highly my services never complained anything i did for him his dissatisfaction proceeded from my having insisted on quitting him consequence useless complaints i had frequently made on several occasions ambassadors ministers king with whom we were correspondence complimented him on merit his secretary manner by which he ought have been flattered but which his poor head produced quite contrary effect he received one particular relative affair importance for which he never pardoned me he was so incapable bearing least constraint that on saturday day despatches for most courts he could not contain himself wait till business was done before he went out incessantly pressing me hasten despatches king ministers he signed them with precipitation immediately went i know not where leaving most other letters without signing this obliged me when these contained nothing but news convert them into journals but when affairs which related king were question it was necessary somebody should sign i did it this once happened relative some important advice we had just received from m vincent charge des affaires from king at vienna prince lobkowitz was then marching naples count gages had just made most memorable retreat finest military manoeuvre whole century which europe has not sufficiently spoken despatch informed us that man whose person m vincent described had set out from vienna was pass by venice his way into abruzzo where he was secretly stir up people at approach austrians absence m le comte de montaigu who did not give himself least concern about anything i forwarded this advice marquis de l hopital so apropos that it is perhaps poor jean jacques so abused laughed at that house bourbon owes preservation kingdom naples marquis de l hopital when he thanked his colleague as it was proper he should do spoke him his secretary mentioned service he had just rendered common cause comte de montaigu who that affair had reproach himself with negligence thought he perceived compliment paid him by m de l hopital something like reproach spoke it me with signs ill humor i found it necessary act same manner with count de castellane ambassador at constantinople as i had done with marquis de l hopital although things less importance as there was no other conveyance constantinople than by couriers sent from time time by senate its bailli advice their departure was given ambassador france that he might write by them his colleague if he thought proper so do this advice was commonly sent day or two beforehand but m de montaigu was held so little respect that merely for sake form he was sent couple hours before couriers set off this frequently obliged me write despatch his absence m de castellane his answer made honorable mention me m de jonville at genoa did same these instances their regard esteem became new grievances i acknowledge i did not neglect any opportunity making myself known but i never sought one improperly serving well i thought i had right aspire natural return for essential services esteem those capable judging rewarding them i will not say whether or not my exactness discharging duties my employment was just subject complaint from ambassador but i cannot refrain from declaring that it was sole grievance he ever mentioned previous our separation his house which he had never put on good footing was constantly filled with rabble french were ill treated it ascendancy was given italians these even more honest part they who had long been service embassy were indecently discharged his first gentleman particular whom he had taken from comte de froulay who if i remember right was called comte de peati or something very like that name second gentleman chosen by m de montaigu was outlaw highwayman from mantua called dominic vitali whom ambassador intrusted care his house who had by means flattery sordid economy obtained his confidence became his favorite great prejudice few honest people he still had about him secretary who was at their head countenance upright man always gives inquietude knaves nothing more was necessary make vitali conceive hatred against me but for this sentiment there was still another cause which rendered it more cruel this i must give account that i may be condemned if i am found wrong ambassador had according custom box at each theaters every day at dinner he named theater which it was his intention go i chose after him gentlemen disposed other boxes when i went out i took key box i had chosen one day vitali not being way i ordered footman who attended on me bring me key house which i named him vitali instead sending key said he had disposed it i was more enraged at this as footman delivered his message public evening vitali wished make me some apology which however i would not listen morrow sir said i him you will come at such hour apologize me house where i received affront presence persons who were witnesses it or after morrow whatever may be consequences either you or i will leave house this firmness intimidated him he came house at hour appointed made me public apology with meanness worthy himself but he afterwards took his measures at leisure at same time that he cringed me public he secretly acted so vile manner that although unable prevail on ambassador give me my dismission he laid me under necessity resolving leave him wretch like him certainly could not know me but he knew enough my character make it serviceable his purposes he knew i was mild excess patient bearing involuntary wrongs but haughty impatient when insulted with premeditated offences loving decency dignity things which these were requisite not more exact requiring respect due myself than attentive rendering that which i owed others this he undertook disgust me this he succeeded he turned house upside down destroyed order subordination i had endeavored establish it house without woman stands need rather severe discipline preserve that modesty which is inseparable from dignity he soon converted ours into place filthy debauch scandalous licentiousness haunt knaves debauchees he procured for second gentleman his excellency place him whom he got discharged another pimp like himself who kept house ill fame at cross malta indecency these two rascals was equalled by nothing but their insolence except bed chamber ambassador which however was not very good order there was not corner whole house supportable modest man as his excellency did not sup gentleman myself had private table at which abbe binis pages also ate most paltry ale house people are served with more cleanliness decency have cleaner linen table better supplied we had but one little very filthy candle pewter plates iron forks i could have overlooked what passed secret but i was deprived my gondola i was only secretary ambassador who was obliged hire one or go on foot livery his excellency no longer accompanied me except when i went senate besides everything which passed house was known city all those who were service other ambassadors loudly exclaimed dominic only cause all exclaimed louder than anybody well knowing indecency with which we were treated was more affecting me than any other person though i was only one house who said nothing matter abroad i complained loudly it ambassador as well as himself who secretly excited by wretch entirely devoted his will daily made me suffer some new affront obliged spend good deal keep up footing with those same situation with myself make are appearance proper my employment i could not touch farthing my salary when i asked him for money he spoke his esteem for me his confidence as if either these could have filled my purse provided for everything these two banditti at length quite turned head their master who naturally had not good one ruined him by continual traffic by bargains which he was dupe whilst they persuaded him they were greatly his favor they persuaded him take upon brenta palazzo at twice rent it was worth divided surplus with proprietor apartments were inlaid with mosaic ornamented with columns pilasters taste country m de montaigu had all these superbly masked by fir wainscoting for no other reason than because at paris apartments were thus fitted up it was for similar reason that he only all ambassadors who were at venice took from his pages their swords from his footmen their canes such was man who perhaps from same motive took dislike me on account my serving him faithfully i patiently endured his disdain his brutality ill treatment as long as perceiving them accompanied by ill humor i thought they had them no portion hatred but moment i saw design formed depriving me honor i merited by my faithful services i resolved resign my employment first mark i received his ill will was relative dinner he was give duke modena his family who were at venice at which he signified me i should not be present i answered piqued but not angry that having honor daily dine at his table if duke modena when he came required i should not appear at it my duty as well as dignity his excellency would not suffer me consent such request how said he passionately my secretary who is not gentleman pretends dine with sovereign when my gentlemen do not yes sir replied i post with which your excellency has honored me as long as i discharge functions it so far ennobles me that my rank is superior that your gentlemen or persons calling themselves such i am admitted where they cannot appear you cannot but know that on day on which you shall make your public entry i am called ceremony by etiquette by immemorial custom follow you dress ceremony afterwards dine with you at palace st mark i know not why man who has right is eat public with doge senate venice should not eat private with duke modena though this argument was unanswerable it did not convince ambassador but we had no occasion renew dispute as duke modena did not come dine with him from that moment he did everything his power make things disagreeable me endeavored unjustly deprive me my rights by taking from me pecuniary advantages annexed my employment give them his dear vitali i am convinced that had he dared send him senate my place he would have done it he commonly employed abbe binis his closet write his private letters he made use him write m de maurepas account affair captain olivet which far from taking least notice me only person who gave himself any concern about matter he deprived me honor depositions which he sent him duplicate for purpose attributing them patizel who had not opened his mouth he wished mortify me please his favorite but had no desire dismiss me his service he perceived it would be more difficult find me successor than m follau who had already made him known world italian secretary was absolutely necessary him on account answers from senate one who could write all his despatches conduct his affairs without his giving himself least trouble about anything person who merit serving him well could join baseness being toad eater his gentlemen without honor merit or principles he wished retain humble me by keeping me far from my country his own without money return either which he would perhaps had succeeded had he began with more moderation but vitali who had other views wished force me extremities carried his point moment i perceived i lost all my trouble that ambassador imputed me my services as so many crimes instead being satisfied with them that with him i had nothing expect but things disagreeable at home injustice abroad that general disesteem into which he was fallen his ill offices might be prejudicial me without possibility my being served by his good ones i took my resolution asked him for my dismission leaving him sufficient time provide himself with another secretary without answering yes or no he continued treat me same manner as if nothing had been said perceiving things remain same state that he took no measures procure himself new secretary i wrote his brother explaining him my motives begged he would obtain my dismission from his excellency adding that whether i received it or not i could not possibly remain with him i waited long time without any answer began be embarrassed but at length ambassador received letter from his brother which must have remonstrated with him very plain terms for although he was extremely subject ferocious rage i never saw him so violent as on this occasion after torrents unsufferable reproaches not knowing what more say he accused me having sold his ciphers i burst into loud laughter asked him sneering manner if he thought there was venice man who would be fool enough give half crown for them all he threatened call his servants throw me out window until then i had been very composed but on this threat anger indignation seized me my turn i sprang door after having turned button which fastened it within no count said i returning him with grave step your servants shall have nothing do with this affair please let it be settled between ourselves my action manner instantly made him calm fear surprise were marked his countenance moment i saw his fury abated i bid him adieu very few words without waiting for his answer went door opened it passed slowly across antechamber through midst his people who rose according custom who i am opinion would rather have lent their assistance against him than me without going back my apartment i descended stairs immediately went out palace never more enter it i hastened immediately m le blond related him what had happened knowing man he was but little surprised he kept me dinner this dinner although without preparation was splendid all french consequence who were at venice partook it ambassador had not single person consul related my case company cry was general by no means favor his excellency he had not settled my account nor paid me farthing being reduced few louis i had my pocket i was extremely embarrassed about my return france every purse was opened me i took twenty sequins from that m le blond as many from that m st cyr with whom next m le blond i was most intimately connected i returned thanks rest till my departure went lodge at house chancellor consulship prove public nation was not accomplice injustice ambassador his excellency furious at seeing me taken notice my misfortune at same time that notwithstanding his being ambassador nobody went near his house quite lost his senses behaved like madman he forgot himself so far as present memoir senate get me arrested on being informed this by abbe de binis i resolved remain fortnight longer instead setting off next day as i had intended my conduct had been known approved by everybody i was universally esteemed senate did not deign return answer extravagant memoir ambassador but sent me word i might remain venice as long as i thought proper without making myself uneasy about attempts madman i continued see my friends i went take leave ambassador from spain who received me well comte de finochietti minister from naples whom i did not find at home i wrote him letter received from his excellency most polite obliging answer at length i took my departure leaving behind me notwithstanding my embarrassment no other debts than two sums i had borrowed which i have just spoken account fifty crowns with shopkeeper name morandi which carrio promised pay which i have never reimbursed him although we have frequently met since that time but with respect two sums money i returned them very exactly moment i had it my power i cannot take leave venice without saying something celebrated amusements that city or at least little part them which i partook during my residence there it has been seen how little my youth i ran after pleasures that age or those that are so called my inclinations did not change at venice but my occupations which moreover would have prevented this rendered more agreeable me simple recreations i permitted myself first most pleasing all was society men merit m le blond de st cyr carrio altuna forlinian gentleman whose name i am very sorry have forgotten whom i never call my recollection without emotion he was man all i ever knew whose heart most resembled my own we were connected with two or three englishmen great wit information like ourselves passionately fond music all these gentlemen had their wives female friends or mistresses latter were most them women talents at whose apartments there were balls concerts there was but little play lively turn talents theatres rendered this amusement incipid play is resource none but men whose time hangs heavy on their hands i had brought with me from paris prejudice that city against italian music but i had also received from nature sensibility niceness distinction which prejudice cannot withstand i soon contracted that passion for italian music with which it inspires all those who are capable feeling its excellence listening barcaroles i found i had not yet known what singing was i soon became so fond opera that tired babbling eating playing boxes when i wished listen i frequently withdrew from company another part theater there quite alone shut up my box i abandoned myself notwithstanding length representation pleasure enjoying it at ease unto conclusion one evening at theatre saint chrysostom i fell into more profound sleep than i should have done my bed loud brilliant airs did not disturb my repose but who can explain delicious sensations given me by soft harmony angelic music by which i was charmed from sleep what awaking what ravishment what ecstasy when at same instant i opened my ears eyes my first idea was believe i was paradise ravishing air which i still recollect shall never forget began with these words conservami la bella che si m accende il cor i was desirous having it i had kept it for time but it was not same thing upon paper as my head notes were same but thing was different this divine composition can never be executed but my mind same manner as it was evening on which it woke me from sleep kind music far superior my opinion that operas which all italy has not its equal nor perhaps whole world is that scuole scuole are houses charity established for education young girls without fortune whom republic afterwards gives portion either marriage or for cloister amongst talents cultivated these young girls music is first rank every sunday at church each four scuole during vespers motettos or anthems with full choruses accompanied by great orchestra composed directed by best masters italy are sung galleries by girls only not one whom is more than twenty years age i have not idea anything so voluptuous affecting as this music richness art exquisite taste vocal part excellence voices justness execution everything these delightful concerts concurs produce impression which certainly is not mode but from which i am opinion no heart is secure carrio i never failed being present at these vespers mendicanti we were not alone church was always full lovers art even actors opera came there form their tastes after these excellent models what vexed me was iron grate which suffered nothing escape but sounds concealed from me angels which they were worthy i talked nothing else one day i spoke it at le blond s if you are so desirous said he see those little girls it will be easy matter satisfy your wishes i am one administrators house i will give you collation with them i did not let him rest until he had fulfilled his promise entering saloon which contained these beauties i so much sighed see i felt trembling love which i had never before experienced m le blond presented me one after other these celebrated female singers whom names voices were all with which i was acquainted come sophia she was horrid come cattina she had but one eye come bettina small pox had entirely disfigured her scarcely one them was without some striking defect le blond laughed at my surprise however two or three them appeared tolerable these never sung but choruses i was almost despair during collation we endeavored excite them they soon became enlivened ugliness does not exclude graces i found they possessed them i said myself they cannot sing this manner without intelligence sensibility they must have both fine my manner seeing them changed such degree that i left house almost love with each these ugly faces i had scarcely courage enough return vespers but after having seen girls danger was lessened i still found their singing delightful their voices so much embellished their persons that spite my eyes i obstinately continued think them beautiful music italy is accompanied with so trifling expense that it is not worth while for such as have taste for it deny themselves pleasure it affords i hired harpsichord for half crown i had at my apartment four or five symphonists with whom i practised once week executing such airs etc as had given me most pleasure at opera i also had some symphonies performed from my muses galantes whether these pleased performers or ballet master st john chrysostom wished flatter me he desired have two them i had afterwards pleasure hearing these executed by that admirable orchestra they were danced by little bettina pretty amiable kept by spaniard m fagoaga friend ours with whom we often went spend evening but apropos girls easy virtue it is not venice that man abstains from them have you nothing confess somebody will ask me upon this subject yes i have something say upon it i will proceed confession with same ingenuousness with which i have made my former ones i always had disinclination girls pleasure but at venice those were all i had within my reach most houses being shut against me on account my place daughters m le blond were very amiable but difficult access i had too much respect for father mother ever once have least desire for them i should have had much stronger inclination young lady named mademoiselle de cataneo daughter agent from king prussia but carrio was love with her there was even between them some question marriage he was easy circumstances i had no fortune his salary was hundred louis guineas year mine amounted no more than thousand livres about forty pounds sterling besides my being unwilling oppose friend i knew that all places especially at venice with purse so ill furnished as mine was gallantry was out question i had not lost pernicious custom deceiving my wants too busily employed forcibly feel those proceeding from climate i lived upwards year that city as chastely as i had done paris at end eighteen months i quitted it without having approached sex except twice by means singular opportunities which i am going speak first was procured me by that honest gentleman vitali some time after formal apology i obliged him make me conversation at table turned on amusements venice these gentlemen reproached me with my indifference with regard most delightful them all at same time extolling gracefulness elegant manners women easy virtue venice adding that they were superior all others same description any other part world dominic said i must make acquaintance most amiable them all he offered take me her apartments assured me i should be pleased with her i laughed at this obliging offer count piati man years venerable observed me with more candor than i should have expected from italian that he thought me too prudent suffer myself be taken such place by my enemy fact i had no inclination do it but notwithstanding this by incoherence i cannot myself comprehend i at length was prevailed upon go contrary my inclination sentiment my heart my reason even my will solely from weakness being ashamed show appearance least mistrust besides as expression country is per non parer troppo cogliono not appear too great blockhead padoana whom we went visit was pretty she was even handsome but her beauty was not that kind that pleased me dominic left me with her i sent for sorbetti asked her sing about half hour i wished take my leave after having put ducat on table but this by singular scruple she refused until she had deserved it i from as singular folly consented remove her doubts i returned palace so fully persuaded that i should feel consequences this step that first thing i did was send for king s surgeon ask him for ptisans nothing can equal uneasiness mind i suffered for three weeks without its being justified by any real inconvenience or apparent sign i could not believe it was possible withdraw with impunity from arms padoana surgeon himself had greatest difficulty removing my apprehensions nor could he do this by any other means than by persuading me i was formed such manner as not be easily infected although experiment i exposed myself less than any other man would have done my health that respect never having suffered least inconvenience my opinion proof surgeon was right however this has never made me imprudent if fact i have received such advantage from nature i can safely assert i have never abused it my second adventure although likewise with common girl was nature very different as well its origin as its effects i have already said that captain olivet gave me dinner on board his vessel that i took with me secretary spanish embassy i expected salute cannon ship s company was drawn up receive us but not so much as priming was burnt at which i was mortified on account carrio whom i perceived be rather piqued at neglect salute cannon was given on board merchant ships people less consequence than we were i besides thought i deserved some distinguished mark respect from captain i could not conceal my thoughts because this at all times was impossible me although dinner was very good one olivet did honors it perfectly well i began it ill humor eating but little speaking still less at first health at least i expected volley nothing carrio who read what passed within me laughed at hearing me grumble like child before dinner was half over i saw gondola approach vessel bless me sir said captain take care yourself enemy approaches i asked him what he meant he answered jocosely gondola made ship s side i observed gay young damsel come on board very lightly coquettishly dressed who at three steps was cabin seated by my side before i had time perceive cover was laid for her she was equally charming lively brunette not more than twenty years age she spoke nothing but italian her accent alone was sufficient turn my head as she ate chattered she cast her eyes upon me steadfastly looked at me for moment then exclaimed good virgin ah my dear bremond what age it is since i saw thee then she threw herself into my arms sealed her lips mine pressed me almost strangling her large black eyes like those beauties east darted fiery shafts into my heart although surprise at first stupefied my senses voluptuousness made rapid progress within this such degree that beautiful seducer herself was notwithstanding spectators obliged restrain my ardor for i was intoxicated or rather become furious when she perceived she had made impression she desired she became more moderate her caresses but not her vivacity when she thought proper explain us real or false cause all her petulance she said i resembled m de bremond director customs tuscany such degree as be mistaken for him that she had turned this m de bremond s head would do it again that she had quitted him because he was fool that she took me his place that she would love me because it pleased her so do for which reason i must love her as long as it was agreeable her when she thought proper send me about my business i must be patient as her dear bremond had been what was said was done she took possession me as man that belonged her gave me her gloves keep her fan her cinda her coif ordered me go here or there do this or that i instantly obeyed her she told me go send away her gondola because she chose make use mine i immediately sent it away she bid me move from my place pray carrio sit down it because she had something say him i did as she desired they chatted good while together but spoke low i did not interrupt them she called me i approached her hark thee zanetto said she me i will not be loved french manner this indeed will not be well first moment lassitude get thee gone but stay not by way i caution thee after dinner we went see glass manufactory at murano she bought great number little curiosities for which she left me pay without least ceremony but she everywhere gave away little trinkets much greater amount than things we had purchased by indifference with which she threw away her money i perceived she annexed it but little value when she insisted upon payment i am opinion it was more from motive vanity than avarice she was flattered by price her admirers set upon her favors evening we conducted her her apartments as we conversed together i perceived couple pistols upon her toilette ah ah said i taking one them up this is patchbox new construction may i ask what is its use i know you have other arms which give more fire than those upon your table after few pleasantries same kind she said us with ingenuousness which rendered her still more charming when i am complaisant persons whom i do not love i make them pay for weariness they cause me nothing can be more just but if i suffer their caresses i will not bear their insults nor miss first who shall be wanting me respect at taking leave her i made another appointment for next day i did not make her wait i found her vestito di confidenza undress more than wanton unknown northern countries which i will not amuse myself describing although i recollect it perfectly well i shall only remark that her ruffles collar were edged with silk network ornamented with rose colored pompons this my eyes much enlivened beautiful complexion i afterwards found it be mode at venice effect is so charming that i am surprised it has never been introduced france i had no idea transports which awaited me i have spoken madam de larnage with transport which remembrance her still sometimes gives me but how old ugly cold she appeared compared with my zulietta do not attempt form yourself idea charms graces this enchanting girl you will be far too short truth young virgins cloisters are not so fresh beauties seraglio are less animated houris paradise less engaging never was so sweet enjoyment offered heart senses mortal ah had i at least been capable fully tasting it for single moment i had tasted it but without charm i enfeebled all its delights i destroyed them as at will no nature has not made me capable enjoyment she has infused into my wretched head poison that ineffable happiness desire which she first placed my heart if there be circumstance my life which describes my nature it is that which i am going relate forcible manner which i at this moment recollect object my book will here make me hold contempt false delicacy which would prevent me from fulfilling it whoever you may be who are desirous knowing man have courage read two or three following pages you will become fully acquainted with j j rousseau i entered chamber woman easy virtue as sanctuary love beauty her person i thought i saw divinity i should have been inclined think that without respect esteem it was impossible feel anything like that which she made me experience scarcely had i her first familiarities discovered force her charms caresses before i wished for fear losing fruit them gather it beforehand suddenly instead flame which consumed me i felt mortal cold run through all my veins my legs failed me ready faint away i sat down wept like child who would guess cause my tears what at this moment passed within me i said myself object my power is masterpiece love her wit person equally approach perfection she is as good generous as she is amiable beautiful yet she is miserable prostitute abandoned public captain merchantship disposed her at will she has thrown herself into my arms although she knows i have nothing my merit with which she cannot be acquainted can be her no inducement this there is something inconceivable either my heart deceives me fascinates my senses makes me dupe unworthy slut or some secret defect which i am ignorant destroys effect her charms renders her odious eyes those by whom her charms would otherwise be disputed i endeavored by extraordinary effort mind discover this defect but it did not so much as strike me that even consequences be apprehended might possibly have some influence clearness her skin brilliancy her complexion her white teeth sweet breath appearance neatness about her person so far removed from me this idea that still doubt relative my situation after affair padoana i rather apprehended i was not sufficiently health for her i am firmly persuaded i was not deceived my opinion these reflections so apropos agitated me such degree as make me shed tears zuliette whom scene was quite novel was struck speechless for moment but having made turn her chamber passing before her glass she comprehended my eyes confirmed her opinion that disgust had no part what had happened it was not difficult for her recover me dispel this shamefacedness but at moment which i was ready faint upon bosom which for first time seemed suffer impression hand lips man i perceived she had withered teton i struck my forehead i examined thought i perceived this teton was not formed like other i immediately began consider how it was possible have such defect persuaded its proceeding from some great natural vice i was clearly convinced that instead most charming person whom i could form myself idea i had my arms species monster refuse nature men love i carried my stupidity so far as speak her discovery i had made she at first took what i said jocosely her frolicsome humor did said things which made me die love but perceiving inquietude i could not conceal she at length reddened adjusted her dress raised herself up without saying word went placed herself at window i attempted place myself by her side she withdrew sofa rose from it next moment fanning herself as she walked about chamber said me reserved disdainful tone voice zanetto lascia le donne studia la matematica leave women study mathematics before i took leave i requested her appoint another rendezvous for next day which she postponed for three days adding with satirical smile that i must needs be want repose i was very ill at ease during interval my heart was full her charms graces i felt my extravagance reproached myself with it regretting loss moments i had so ill employed which had i chosen i might have rendered more agreeable than any my whole life waiting with most burning impatience for moment which i might repair loss yet notwithstanding all my reasoning upon what i had discovered anxious reconcile perfections this adorable girl with indignity her situation i ran i flew her apartment at hour appointed i know not whether or not her ardor would have been more satisfied with this visit her pride at least would have been flattered by it i already rejoiced at idea my convincing her every respect that i knew how repair wrongs i had done she spared me this justification gondolier whom i had sent her apartment brought me for answer that she had set off evening before for florence if i had not felt all love i had for her person when this was my possession i felt it most cruel manner on losing her amiable charming as she was my eyes i could not console myself for loss her but this i have never been able do relative contemptuous idea which at her departure she must have had me these are my two narratives eighteen months i passed at venice furnished me with no other same kind except simple prospect at most carrio was gallant tired visiting girls engaged others he took fancy have one himself as we were inseparable he proposed me arrangement common enough at venice which was keep one girl for us both this i consented question was find one who was safe he was so industrious his researches that he found out little girl from eleven twelve years age whom her infamous mother was endeavoring sell i went with carrio see her sight child moved me most lively compassion she was fair as gentle as lamb nobody would have taken her for italian living is very cheap venice we gave little money mother provided for subsistence her daughter she had voice procure her some resource we gave her spinnet singing master all these expenses did not cost each us more than two sequins month we contrived save much greater sum other matters but as we were obliged wait until she became riper age this was sowing long time before we could possibly reap however satisfied with passing our evenings chatting innocently playing with child we perhaps enjoyed greater pleasure than if we had received last favors so true is it that men are more attached women by certain pleasure they have living with them than by any kind libertinism my heart became insensibly attached little anzoletta but my attachment was paternal which senses had so little share that proportion as former increased have connected it with latter would have been less possible i felt i should have experienced at approaching this little creature when become nubile same horror with which abominable crime incest would have inspired me i perceived sentiments carrio take unobserved by himself exactly same turn we thus prepared for ourselves without intending it pleasure not less delicious but very different from that which we first had idea i am fully persuaded that however beautiful poor child might have become far from being corrupters her innocence we should have been protectors it circumstance which shortly afterwards befell me deprived me happiness taking part this good work my only merit affair was inclination my heart i will now return my journey my first intentions after leaving m de montaigu was retire geneva until time more favorable circumstances should have removed obstacles which prevented my union with my poor mamma but quarrel between me m de montaigu being become public he having had folly write about it court i resolved go there give account my conduct complain that madman i communicated my intention from venice m du theil charged per interim with foreign affairs after death m amelot i set off as soon as my letter took my route through bergamo como domo d oscela crossing saint plomb at sion m de chaignon charge des affaires from france showed me great civility at geneva m de la closure treated me with same polite attention i there renewed my acquaintance with m de gauffecourt from whom i had some money receive i had passed through nion without going see my father not that this was matter indifference me but because i was unwilling appear before my mother law after disaster which had befallen me certain being condemned by her without being heard bookseller du villard old friend my father s reproached me severely with this neglect i gave him my reasons for it repair my fault without exposing myself meet my mother law i took chaise we went together nion stopped at public house du villard went fetch my father who came running embrace me we supped together after passing evening very agreeable wishes my heart i returned next morning geneva with du villard for whom i have ever since retained sentiment gratitude return for service he did me on this occasion lyons was little out my direct road but i was determined pass through that city order convince myself knavish trick played me by m de montaigu i had sent me from paris little box containing waistcoat embroidered with gold few pairs ruffles six pairs white silk stockings nothing more upon proposition made me by m de montaigu i ordered this box be added his baggage apothecary s bill he offered me payment my salary which he wrote out himself he stated weight this box which he called bale at eleven hundred pounds charged me with carriage it at enormous rate by cares m boy de la tour whom i was recommended by m roquin his uncle it was proved from registers customs lyons marseilles that said bale weighed no more than forty five pounds had paid carriage according that weight i joined this authentic extract memoir m de montaigu provided with these papers others containing stronger facts i returned paris very impatient make use them during whole this long journey i had little adventures at como valais elsewhere i there saw many curious things amongst others boroma islands which are worthy being described but i am pressed by time surrounded by spies i am obliged write haste very imperfectly work which requires leisure tranquility i do not enjoy if ever providence its goodness grants me days more calm i shall destine them new modelling this work should i be able do it or at least giving supplement which i perceive it stands greatest need i have given up this project news my quarrel had reached paris before me on my arrival i found people all offices public general scandalized at follies ambassador notwithstanding this public talk at venice unanswerable proof i exhibited i could not obtain even shadow justice far from obtaining satisfaction or reparation i was left at discretion ambassador for my salary this for no other reason than because not being frenchman i had no right national protection that it was private affair between him myself everybody agreed i was insulted injured unfortunate that ambassador was mad cruel iniquitous that whole affair dishonored him forever but what this he was ambassador i was nothing more than secretary order or that which is so called was opposition my obtaining justice this least shadow was not granted me i supposed that by loudly complaining by publicly treating this madman manner he deserved i should at length be told hold my tongue this was what i wished for i was fully determined not obey until i had obtained redress but at that time there was no minister for foreign affairs i was suffered exclaim nay even encouraged do it joined with but affair still remained same state until tired being right without obtaining justice my courage at length failed me let whole drop only person by whom i was ill received from whom i should have least expected such injustice was madam de beuzenval full prerogatives rank nobility she could not conceive it was possible ambassador could ever be wrong with respect his secretary reception she gave me was conformable this prejudice i was so piqued at it that immediately after leaving her i wrote her perhaps one strongest most violent letters that ever came from my pen since that time i never once returned her house i was better received by father castel but midst his jesuitical wheedling i perceived him faithfully follow one great maxims his society which is sacrifice weak powerful strong conviction i felt justice my cause my natural greatness mind did not suffer me patiently endure this partiality i ceased visiting father castel on that account going college jesuits where i knew nobody but himself besides intriguing tyrannical spirit his brethren so different from cordiality good father hemet gave me such disgust for their conversation that i have never since been acquainted with nor seen anyone them except father berthier whom i saw twice or thrice at m dupin s conjunction with whom he labored with all his might at refutation montesquieu that i may not return subject i will conclude what i have say m de montaigu i had told him our quarrels that secretary was not what he wanted but attorney s clerk he took hint person whom he procured succeed me was real attorney who less than year robbed him twenty or thirty thousand livres he discharged him sent him prison dismissed his gentleman with disgrace wretchedness got himself everywhere into quarrels received affronts which footman would not have put up with after numerous follies was recalled sent from capital it is very probable that among reprimands he received at court his affair with me was not forgotten at least little time after his return he sent his maitre d hotel settle my account give me some money i was want it at that moment my debts at venice debts honor if ever there were any lay heavy upon my mind i made use means which offered discharge them as well as note zanetto nani i received what was offered me paid all my debts remained as before without farthing my pocket but relieved from weight which had become insupportable from that time i never heard speak m de montaigu until his death with which i became acquainted by means gazette peace god be with that poor man he was as fit for functions ambassador as my infancy i had been for those grapignan however it was his power have honorably supported himself by my services rapidly have advanced me career which comte de gauvon had destined me my youth functions which i had more advanced age rendered myself capable justice inutility my complaints left my mind seeds indignation against our foolish civil institutions by which welfare public real justice are always sacrificed i know not what appearance order which does nothing more than add sanction public authority oppression weak iniquity powerful two things prevented these seeds from putting forth at that time as they afterwards did one was myself being question affair private interest whence nothing great or noble ever proceeded could not draw from my heart divine soarings which most pure love only that which is just sublime can produce other was charm friendship which tempered calmed my wrath by ascendancy more pleasing sentiment i had become acquainted at venice with biscayan friend my friend carrio s worthy being that every honest man this amiable young man born with every talent virtue had just made tour italy gain taste for fine arts imagining he had nothing more acquire intended return by most direct road his own country i told him arts were nothing more than relaxation genius like his fit cultivate sciences give him taste for these i advised him make journey paris reside there for six months he took my advice went paris he was there expected me when i arrived his lodging was too considerable for him he offered me half it which i instantly accepted i found him absorbed study sublimest sciences nothing was above his reach he digested everything with prodigious rapidity how cordially did he thank me for having procured him this food for his mind which was tormented by thirst after knowledge without his being aware it what treasure light virtue i found vigorous mind this young man i felt he was friend i wanted we soon became intimate our tastes were not same we constantly disputed both opinionated we never could agree about anything nevertheless we could not separate notwithstanding our reciprocal incessant contradiction we neither us wished other be different from what he was ignacio emanuel de altuna was one those rare beings whom only spain produces whom she produces too few for her glory he had not violent national passions common his own country idea vengeance could no more enter his head than desire it could proceed from his heart his mind was too great be vindictive i have frequently heard him say with greatest coolness that no mortal could offend him he was gallant without being tender he played with women as with so many pretty children he amused himself with mistresses his friends but i never knew him have one his own nor least desire for it emanations from virtue with which his heart was stored never permitted fire passions excite sensual desires after his travels he married died young left children i am as convinced as my existence that his wife was first only woman with whom he ever tasted pleasures love externally he was devout like spaniard but his heart he had piety angel except myself he is only man i ever saw whose principles were not intolerant he never his life asked any person his opinion matters religion it was not least consequence him whether his friend was jew protestant turk bigot or atheist provided he was honest man obstinate headstrong matters indifference but moment religion was question even moral part he collected himself was silent or simply said i am charged with care myself only it is astonishing so much elevation mind should be compatible with spirit detail carried minuteness he previously divided employment day by hours quarters minutes so scrupulously adhered this distribution that had clock struck while he was reading phrase he would have shut his book without finishing it his portions time thus laid out were some them set apart studies one kind others those another he had some for reflection conversation divine service reading locke for his rosary for visits music painting neither pleasure temptation nor complaisance could interrupt this order duty he might have had discharge was only thing that could have done it when he gave me list his distribution that i might conform myself thereto i first laughed then shed tears admiration he never constrained anybody nor suffered constraint he was rather rough with people who from politeness attempted put it upon him he was passionate without being sullen i have often seen him warm but never saw him really angry with any person nothing could be more cheerful than his temper he knew how pass receive joke raillery was one his distinguished talents with which he possessed that pointed wit repartee when he was animated he was noisy heard at great distance but whilst he loudly inveighed smile was spread over his countenance midst his warmth he used some diverting expression which made all his hearers break out into loud laugh he had no more spanish complexion than phlegm that country his skin was white his cheeks finely colored his hair light chestnut he was tall well made his body was well formed for residence his mind this wise hearted as well as wise headed man knew mankind was my friend this was my only answer such as are not so we were so intimately united that our intention was pass our days together few years i was go ascoytia live with him at his estate every part project was arranged eve his departure nothing was left undetermined except that which depends not upon men best concerted plans posterior events my disasters his marriage finally his death separated us forever some men would be tempted say that nothing succeeds except dark conspiracies wicked that innocent intentions good are seldom or never accomplished i had felt inconvenience dependence took resolution never again expose myself it having seen projects ambition which circumstances had induced me form overturned their birth discouraged career i had so well begun from which however i had just been expelled i resolved never more attach myself any person but remain independent state turning my talents best advantage these i at length began feel extent that i had hitherto had too modest opinion them i again took up my opera which i had laid aside go venice that i might be less interrupted after departure altuna i returned my old hotel st quentin which solitary part town not far from luxembourg was more proper for my purpose than noisy rue st honor there only consolation which heaven suffered me taste my misery only one which rendered it supportable awaited me this was not trancient acquaintance i must enter into some detail relative manner which it was made we had new landlady from orleans she took for needlewoman girl from her own country between twenty two twenty three years age who as well as hostess ate at our table this girl named theresa le vasseur was good family her father was officer mint orleans her mother shopkeeper they had many children function mint orleans being suppressed father found himself without employment mother having suffered losses was reduced narrow circumstances she quitted her business came paris with her husband daughter who by her industry maintained all three first time i saw this girl at table i was struck with her modesty still more so with her lively yet charming look which with respect impression it made upon me was never equalled beside m de bonnefond company was composed several irish priests gascons others much same description our hostess herself had not made best possible use her time i was only person at table who spoke behaved with decency allurements were thrown out young girl i took her part joke was then turned against me had i had no natural inclination poor girl compassion contradiction would have produced it me i was always great friend decency manners conversation especially fair sex i openly declared myself her champion perceived she was not insensible my attention her looks animated by gratitude she dared not express by words were for this reason still more penetrating she was very timid i was as much so as herself connection which this disposition common both seemed remove distance was however rapidly formed our landlady perceiving its progress became furious her brutality forwarded my affair with young girl who having no person house except myself give her least support was sorry see me go from home sighed for return her protector affinity our hearts bore each other similarity our dispositions had soon their ordinary effect she thought she saw me honest man this she was not deceived i thought i perceived her woman great sensibility simple her manners devoid all coquetry i was no more deceived her than she me i began by declaring her that i would never either abandon or marry her love esteem artless sincerity were ministers my triumph it was because her heart was tender virtuous that i was happy without being presuming apprehensions she was under my not finding her that for which i sought retarded my happiness more than every other circumstance i perceived her disconcerted confused before she yielded her consent wishing be understood not daring explain herself far from suspecting real cause her embarrassment i falsely imagined it proceed from another motive supposition highly insulting her morals thinking she gave me understand my health might be exposed danger i fell into so perplexed state that although it was no restraint upon me it poisoned my happiness during several days as we did not understand each other our conversations upon this subject were so many enigmas more than ridiculous she was upon point

concern or at most appeared only as present moment prolonged i had no other desire than that insuring its duration this attachment rendered all other dissipation superfluous insipid me as i only went out for purpose going apartment theresa her place residence almost became my own my retirement was so favorable work i had undertaken that less than three months my opera was entirely finished both words music except few accompaniments fillings up which still remained be added this maneuvering business was very fatiguing me i proposed it philidor offering him at same time part profits he came twice did something middle parts act ovid but he could not confine himself assiduous application by allurement advantages which were distant uncertain he did not come third time i finished work myself my opera completed next thing was make something it this was by much more difficult task two man living solitude paris will never succeed anything i was on point making my way by means m de la popliniere whom gauffecourt at my return geneva had introduced me m de la popliniere was mecaenas rameau madam de la popliniere his very humble scholar rameau was said govern that house judging that he would with pleasure protect work one his disciples i wished show him what i had done he refused examine it saying he could not read score it was too fatiguing him m de la popliniere obviate this difficulty said he might hear it offered me send for musicians execute certain detached pieces i wished for nothing better rameau consented with ill grace incessantly repeating that composition man not regularly bred science who had learned music without master must certainly be very fine i hastened copy into parts five or six select passages ten symphonies were procured albert berard mademoiselle bourbonnais undertook vocal part rameau moment he heard overture was purposely extravagant his eulogium by which he intended it should be understood it could not be my composition he showed signs impatience at every passage but after counter tenor song air which was noble harmonious with brilliant accompaniment he could no longer contain himself he apostrophised me with brutality at which everybody was shocked maintaining that part what he had heard was by man experienced art rest by some ignorant person who did not so much as understand music it is true my composition unequal without rule was sometimes sublime at others insipid as that person who forms himself art by soarings his own genius unsupported by science must necessarily be rameau pretended see nothing me but contemptible pilferer without talents or taste rest company among whom i must distinguish master house were different opinion m de richelieu who at that time frequently visited m madam de la popliniere heard them speak my work wished hear whole it with intention if it pleased him have it performed at court opera was executed with full choruses by great orchestra at expense king at m de bonneval s intendant menus francoeur directed band effect was surprising duke never ceased exclaim applaud at end one choruses act tasso he arose came me pressing my hand said m rousseau this is transporting harmony i never heard anything finer i will get this performed at versailles madam de la poliniere who was present said not word rameau although invited refused come next day madam de la popliniere received me at her toilette very ungraciously affected undervalue my piece told me that although little false glitter had at first dazzled m de richelieu he had recovered from his error she advised me not place least dependence upon my opera duke arrived soon after spoke me quite different language he said very flattering things my talents seemed as much disposed as ever have my composition performed before king there is nothing said he but act tasso which cannot pass at court you must write another upon this single word i shut myself up my apartment three weeks produced place tasso another act subject which was hesiod inspired by muses this i found secret introducing part history my talents jealousy with which rameau had been pleased honor me there was new act elevation less gigantic better supported than act tasso music was as noble composition better had other two acts been equal this whole piece would have supported representation advantage but whilst i was endeavoring give it last finishing another undertaking suspended completion that i had my hand winter which succeeded battle fontenoi there were many galas at versailles several operas performed at theater little stables among number latter was dramatic piece voltaire entitled la princesse de navarre music by rameau name which has just been changed that fetes de ramire this new subject required several changes be made divertissements as well poetry as music person capable both was now sought after voltaire was lorraine rameau also both whom were employed on opera temple glory could not give their attention this m de richelieu thought me sent desire i would undertake alterations that i might better examine what there was do he gave me separately poem music first place i would not touch words without consent author whom i wrote upon subject very polite respectful letter such one as was proper received from him following answer sir you two talents which hitherto have always been separated are united these are two good reasons for me esteem endeavor love you i am sorry on your account you should employ these talents work which is so little worthy them few months ago duke de richelieu commanded me make absolutely twinkling eye little bad sketch few insipid imperfect scenes be adapted divertissements which are not nature be joined with them i obeyed with greatest exactness i wrote very fast very ill i sent this wretched production m de richelieu imagining he would make no use it or that i should have it again make necessary corrections happily it is your hands you are at full liberty do with it whatever you please i have entirely lost sight thing i doubt not but you will have corrected all faults which cannot but abound so hasty composition such very simple sketch am persuaded you will have supplied whatever was wanting i remember that among other stupid inattentions no account is given scenes which connect divertissements manner which princess grenadine immediately passes from prison garden or palace as it is not magician but spanish nobleman who gives her gala i am opinion nothing should be effected by enchantment i beg sir you will examine this part which i have but confused idea you will likewise consider whether or not it be necessary prison should be opened princess conveyed from it fine palace gilt varnished prepared for her i know all this is wretched that it is beneath thinking being make serious affair such trifles but since we must displease as little as possible it is necessary we should conform reason even bad divertissement opera i depend wholly upon you m ballot soon expect have honor returning you my thanks assuring you how much i am etc there is nothing surprising great politeness this letter compared with almost crude ones which he has since written me he thought i was great favor with madam richelieu courtly suppleness which everyone knows be character this author obliged him be extremely polite new comer until he become better acquainted with measure favor patronage he enjoyed authorized by m de voltaire not under necessity giving myself least concern about m rameau who endeavored injure me i set work two months my undertaking was finished with respect poetry it was confined mere trifle i aimed at nothing more than prevent difference style from being perceived had vanity think i had succeeded musical part was longer more laborious besides my having compose several preparatory pieces amongst others overture all recitative with which i was charged was extremely difficult on account necessity there was connecting few verses by very rapid modulations symphonies choruses keys very different from each other for i was determined neither change nor transpose any airs that rameau might not accuse me having disfigured them i succeeded recitative it was well accented full energy excellent modulation idea two men superior talents with whom i was associated had elevated my genius i can assert that this barren inglorious task which public could have no knowledge i was for most part equal my models piece state which i had brought it was rehearsed great theatre opera three authors who had contributed production i was only one present voltaire was not paris rameau either did not come or concealed himself words first monologue were very mournful they began with o mort viens terminer les malheurs de ma vie o death hasten terminate misfortunes my life these suitable music was necessary it was however upon this that madam de la popliniere founded her censure accusing me with much bitterness having composed funeral anthem m de richelieu very judiciously began by informing himself who was author poetry this monologue i presented him manuscript he had sent me which proved it was by voltaire that case said duke voltaire alone is blame during rehearsal everything i had done was disapproved by madam de la popliniere approved by m de richelieu but i had afterwards do with too powerful adversary it was signified me that several parts my composition wanted revising that on this it was necessary i should consult m rameau my heart was wounded by such conclusion instead eulogium i expected which certainly i merited i returned my apartment overwhelmed with grief exhausted with fatigue consumed by chagrin i was immediately taken ill confined my chamber for upwards six weeks rameau who was charged with alterations indicated by madam de la popliniere sent ask me for overture my great opera substitute it that i had just composed happily i perceived trick he intended play me refused him overture as performance was be five or six days he had not time make one was obliged leave that i had prepared it was italian taste style at that time quite new france it gave satisfaction i learned from m de valmalette maitre d hotel king son law m mussard my relation friend that connoisseurs were highly satisfied with my work that public had not distinguished it from that rameau however he madam de la popliniere took measures prevent any person from knowing i had any concern matter books distributed audience which authors are always named voltaire was only person mentioned rameau preferred suppression his own name seeing it associated with mine as soon as i was situation leave my room i wished wait upon m de richelieu but it was too late he had just set off for dunkirk where he was command expedition destined scotland at his return said i myself authorize my idleness it will be too late for my purpose not having seen him since that time i lost honor mywork emoluments it should have produced me besides considering my time trouble grief vexation my illness money this cost me without ever receiving least benefit or rather recompense however i always thought m de richelieu was disposed serve me that he had favorable opinion my talents but my misfortune madam de la popliniere prevented effect his good wishes i could not divine reason aversion this lady had me i had always endeavored make myself agreeable her regularly paid her my court gauffecourt explained me causes her dislike first said he is her friendship for rameau whom she is declared panegyrist who will not suffer competitor next is original sin which ruins you her estimation which she will never forgive you are genevese upon this he told me abbe hubert who was from same city sincere friend m de la popliniere had used all his efforts prevent him from marrying this lady with whose character temper he was very well acquainted that after marriage she had vowed him implacable hatred as well as all genevese although la popliniere has friendship for you do not said he depend upon his protection he is still love with his wife she hates you is vindictive artful you will never do anything that house all this i took for granted same gauffecourt rendered me much about this time service which i stood greatest need i had just lost my virtuous father who was about sixty years age i felt this loss less severely than i should have done at any other time when embarrassments my situation had less engaged my attention during his life time i had never claimed what remained property my mother which he received little interest his death removed all my scruples upon this subject but want legal proof death my brother created difficulty which gauffecourt undertook remove this he effected by means good offices advocate de lolme as i stood need little resource event being doubtful i waited for definitive account with greatest anxiety one evening on entering my apartment i found letter which i knew contain information i wanted i took it up with impatient trembling which i was inwardly ashamed what said i myself with disdain shall jean jacques thus suffer himself be subdued by interest curiosity i immediately laid letter again upon chimney piece i undressed myself went bed with great composure slept better than ordinary rose morning at late hour without thinking more my letter as i dressed myself it caught my eye i broke seal very leisurely found under envelope bill exchange i felt variety pleasing sensations at same time but i can assert upon my honor that most lively them all was that proceeding from having known how be master myself i could mention twenty such circumstances my life but i am too much pressed for time say everything i sent small part this money my poor mamma regretting with my eyes suffused with tears happy time when i should have laid it all at her feet all her letters contained evident marks her distress she sent me piles recipes numerous secrets with which she pretended i might make my fortune her own idea her wretchedness already affected her heart contracted her mind little i sent her fell prey knaves by whom she was surrounded she received not least advantage from anything idea dividing what was necessary my own subsistence with these wretches disgusted me especially after vain attempt i had made deliver her from them which i shall have occasion speak time slipped away with it little money i had we were two or indeed four persons or speak still more correctly seven or eight although theresa was disinterested degree which there are but few examples her mother was not so she was no sooner little relieved from her necessities by my cares than she sent for her whole family partake fruits them her sisters sons daughters all except her eldest daughter married director coaches augers came paris everything i did for theresa her mother diverted from its original destination favor these people who were starving i had not do with avaricious person not being under influence unruly passion i was not guilty follies satisfied with genteelly supporting theresa without luxury unexposed pressing wants i readily consented let all earnings her industry go profit her mother this even i did not confine myself but by fatality by which i was pursued whilst mamma was prey rascals about her theresa was same her family i could not do anything on either side for benefit her whom succor i gave was destined it was odd enough youngest child m de la vasseur only one who had not received marriage portion from her parents should provide for their subsistence that after having long time been beaten by her brothers sisters even her nieces poor girl should be plundered by them all without being more able defend herself from their thefts than from their blows one her nieces named gorton le duc was mild amiable character although spoiled by lessons examples others as i frequently saw them together i gave them names which they afterwards gave each other i called niece my niece aunt my aunt they both called me uncle hence name aunt by which i continued call theresa which my friends sometimes jocosely repeated it will be judged that such situation i had not moment lose before i attempted extricate myself imagining m de richelieu had forgotten me having no more hopes from court i made some attempts get my opera brought out at paris but i met with difficulties which could not immediately be removed my situation became daily more painful i presented my little comedy narcisse italians it was received i had freedom theatre which gave much pleasure but this was all i could never get my piece performed tired paying my court players i gave myself no more trouble about them at length i had recourse last expedient which remained me only one which i ought have made use while frequenting house m de la popliniere i had neglected family dupin two ladies although related were not on good terms never saw each other there was not least intercourse between two families thieriot was only person who visited both he was desired endeavor bring me again m dupin s m de francueil was then studying natural history chemistry collecting cabinet i believe he aspired become member academy sciences this effect he intended write book judged i might be use him undertaking madam de dupin who on her part had another work contemplation had much same views respect me they wished have me common as kind secretary this was reason invitations thieriot i required that m de francueil should previously employ his interest with that jelyote get my work rehearsed at opera house this he consented muses galantes were several times rehearsed first at magazine afterwards great theatre audience was very numerous at great rehearsal several parts composition were highly applauded however during this rehearsal very ill conducted by rebel i felt piece would not be received that before it could appear great alterations were necessary i therefore withdrew it without saying word or exposing myself refusal but i plainly perceived by several indications that work had it been perfect could not have succeeded m de francueil had promised me get it rehearsed but not that it should be received he exactly kept his word i thought i perceived on this occasion as well as many others that neither madam dupin nor himself were willing i should acquire certain reputation world lest after publication their books it should be supposed they had grafted their talents upon mine yet as madam dupin always supposed those i had be very moderate never employed me except it was write what she dictated or researches pure erudition reproach with respect her would have been unjust this last failure success completed my discouragement i abandoned every prospect fame advancement without further troubling my head about real or imaginary talents with which i had so little success i dedicated my whole time cares procure myself theresa subsistence manner most pleasing those whom it should be agreeable provide for it i therefore entirely attached myself madam dupin m de francueil this did not place me very opulent situation for with eight or nine hundred livres which i had first two years i had scarcely enough provide for my primary wants being obliged live their neighborhood dear part town furnished lodging having pay for another lodging at extremity paris at very top rue saint jacques which let weather be as it would i went almost every evening supper i soon got into track my new occupations conceived taste for them i attached myself study chemistry attended several courses it with m de francueil at m rouelle s we began scribble over paper upon that science which we scarcely possessed elements 1717 we went pass autumn tourraine at castle chenonceaux royal mansion upon cher built by henry ii for diana poitiers whom ciphers are still seen which is now possession m dupin farmer general we amused ourselves very agreeably this beautiful place lived very well i became as fat there as monk music was favorite relaxation i composed several trios full harmony which i may perhaps speak my supplement if ever i should write one theatrical performances were another resource i wrote comedy fifteen days entitled l engagement temeraire rash engagement which will be found amongst my papers it has no other merit than that being lively i composed several other little things amongst others poem entitled l aliee de sylvie from name alley park upon bank cher this without discontinuing my chemical studies or interrupting what i had do for madam dupin whilst i was increasing my corpulency at chenonceaux that my poor theresa was augmented at paris another manner at my return i found work i had put upon frame greater forwardness than i had expected this on account my situation would have thrown me into greatest embarrassment had not one my messmates furnished me with only resource which could relieve me from it this is one those essential narratives which i cannot give with too much simplicity because making improper use their names i should either excuse or inculpate myself both which this place are entirely out question during residence altuna at paris instead going eat at traiteurs he i commonly ate neighborhood almost opposite cul de sac opera at house madam la selle wife tailor who gave but very ordinary dinners but whose table was much frequented on account safe company which generally resorted it no person was received without being introduced by one those who used house commander de graville old debauchee with much wit politeness but obscene conversation lodged at house brought it set riotous extravagant young men officers guards mousquetaires commander de nonant chevalier all girls opera was daily oracle who conveyed us news this motley crew m du plessis lieutenant colonel retired from service old man great goodness wisdom m ancelet officer mousquetaires kept young people certain kind order it was this m ancelet i gave little comedy after my own manner entitled les prisouniers de guerre which i wrote after disasters french bavaria bohemia i dared not either avow this comedy or show it this for singular reason that neither king france nor french were ever better spoken nor praised with more sincerity heart than my piece though written by professed republican i dared not declare myself panegyrist nation whose maxims were exactly reverse my own more grieved at misfortunes france than french themselves i was afraid public would construe into flattery mean complaisance marks sincere attachment which my first part i have mentioned date cause which i was ashamed show this table was also frequented by commercial people financiers contractors but extremely polite such as were distinguished amongst those same profession m de besse m de forcade others whose names i have forgotten short well dressed people every description were seen there except abbes men long robe not one whom i ever met house it was agreed not introduce men either these professions this table sufficiently resorted was very cheerful without being noisy many guests were waggish without descending vulgarity old commander with all his smutty stories with respect substance never lost sight politeness old court nor did any indecent expression which even women would not have pardoned him escape his lips his manner served as rule every person at table all young men related their adventures gallantry with equal grace freedom these narratives were more complete as seraglio was at door entry which led it was same for there was communication between this shop le duchapt celebrated milliner who at that time had several very pretty girls with whom our young people went chat before or after dinner i should thus have amused myself as well as rest had i been less modest i had only go as they did but this i never had courage enough do with respect madam de selle i often went eat at her house after departure altuna i learned great number amusing anecdotes by degrees i adopted thank god not morals but maxims i found be established there honest men injured husbands deceived women seduced were most ordinary topics he who had best filled foundling hospital was always most applauded i caught manners i daily had before my eyes i formed my manner thinking upon that i observed be reigning one amongst amiable upon whole very honest people i said myself since it is custom country they who live here may adopt it this is expedient for which i sought i cheerfully determined upon it without least scruple only one i had overcome was that theresa whom with greatest imaginable difficulty i persuaded adopt this only means saving her honor her mother who was moreover apprehensive new embarrassment by increase family came my aid she at length suffered herself be prevailed upon we made choice midwife safe prudent woman mademoiselle gouin who lived at point saint eustache when time came theresa was conducted her house by her mother i went thither several times see her gave her cipher which i had made double upon two cards one them was put into linen child by midwife deposited with infant office foundling hospital according customary form year following similar inconvenience was remedied by same expedient excepting cipher which was forgotten no more reflection on my part nor approbation on that mother she obeyed with trembling all vicissitudes which this fatal conduct has produced my manner thinking as well as my destiny will be successively seen for present we will confine ourselves this first period its cruel unforeseen consequences will but too frequently oblige me refer it i here mark that my first acquaintance with madam d epinay whose name will frequently appear these memoirs she was mademoiselle d esclavelles had lately been married m d epinay son m de lalive de bellegarde farmer general she understood music passion for art produced between these three persons greatest intimacy madam francueil introduced me madam d epinay we sometimes supped together at her house she was amiable had wit talent was certainly desirable acquaintance but she had female friend mademoiselle d ette who was said have much malignancy her disposition she lived with chevalier de valory whose temper was far from being one best i am opinion acquaintance with these two persons was prejudicial madam d epinay whom with disposition which required greatest attention from those about her nature had given very excellent qualities regulate or counterbalance her extravagant pretensions m de francueil inspired her with part friendship he had conceived for me told me connection between them which for that reason i would not now speak were it not become so public as not be concealed from m d epinay himself m de francueil confided me secrets very singular nature relative this lady which she herself never spoke me nor so much as suspected my having knowledge for i never opened my lips her upon subject nor will i ever do it any person confidence all parties had my prudence rendered my situation very embarrassing especially with madam de francueil whose knowledge me was sufficient remove from her all suspicion on my account although i was connected with her rival i did everything i could console this poor woman whose husband certainly did not return affection she had for him i listened these three persons separately i kept all their secrets so faithfully that not one three ever drew from me those two others this without concealing from either women my attachment each them madam de francueil who frequently wished make me agent received refusals form madam d epinay once desiring me charge myself with letter m de francueil received same mortification accompanied by very express declaration that if ever she wished drive me forever from house she had only second time make me like proposition justice madam d epinay i must say that far from being offended with me she spoke my conduct m de francueil terms highest approbation continued receive me as well as politely as ever it was thus amidst heart burnings three persons whom i was obliged behave with greatest circumspection on whom i some measure depended for whom i had conceived attachment that by conducting myself with mildness complaisance although accompanied with greatest firmness i preserved unto last not only their friendship but their esteem confidence notwithstanding my absurdities awkwardness madam d epinay would have me make one party chevrette country house near saint denis belonging m de bellegarde there was theatre which performances were not unfrequent i had part given me which i studied for six months without intermission which on evening representation i was obliged be prompted from beginning end after this experiment no second proposal kind was ever made me my acquaintance with m d epinay procured me that her sister law mademoiselle de bellegarde who soon afterwards became countess houdetot first time i saw her she was upon point marriage when she conversed with me long time with that charming familiarity which was natural her i thought her very amiable but i was far from perceiving that this young person would lead me although innocently into abyss which i still remain although i have not spoken diderot since my return from venice no more than my friend m roguin i did not neglect either them especially former with whom i daily became more intimate he had nannette as well as i theresa this was between us another conformity circumstances but my theresa as fine woman as his nannette was mild amiable character which might gain fix affections worthy man whereas nannette was vixen troublesome prater had no qualities eyes others which any measure compensated for her want education however he married her which was well done him if he had given promise that effect i for my part not having entered into any such engagement was not least haste imitate him i was also connected with abbe de condillac who had acquired no more literary fame than myself but whom there was every appearance his becoming what he now is i was perhaps first who discovered extent his abilities esteemed them as they deserved he on his part seemed satisfied with me whilst shut up my chamber rue jean saint denis near opera house i composed my act hesiod he sometimes came dine with me tete tete we sent for our dinner paid share share alike he was at that time employed on his essay on origin human knowledge which was his first work when this was finished difficulty was find bookseller who would take it booksellers paris are shy every author at his beginning metaphysics not much then vogue were no very inviting subject i spoke diderot condillac his work i afterwards brought them acquainted with each other they were worthy each other s esteem were presently on most friendly terms diderot persuaded bookseller durand take manuscript from abbe this great metaphysician received for his first work almost as favor hundred crowns which perhaps he would not have obtained without my assistance as we lived quarter town very distant from each other we all assembled once week at palais royal went dine at hotel du panier fleuri these little weekly dinners must have been extremely pleasing diderot for he who failed almost all his appointments never missed one these at our little meeting i formed plan periodical paper entitled le persifleur jeerer which diderot i were alternately write i sketched out first sheet this brought me acquainted with d alembert whom diderot had mentioned it unforeseen events frustrated our intention project was carried no further these two authors had just undertaken dictionnaire encyclopedique which at first was intended be nothing more than kind translation chambers something like that medical dictionary james which diderot had just finished diderot was desirous i should do something this second undertaking proposed me musical part which i accepted this i executed great haste consequently very ill three months he had given me as well as all authors who were engaged work but i was only person readiness at time prescribed i gave him my manuscript which i had copied by lackey belonging m de francueil name dupont who wrote very well i paid him ten crowns out my own pocket these have never been reimbursed me diderot had promised me retribution on part booksellers which he has never since spoken me nor i him this undertaking encyclopedie was interrupted by his imprisonment pensees philosophiques drew upon him some temporary inconvenience which had no disagreeable consequences he did not come off so easily on account lettre sur les aveugles which there was nothing reprehensible but some personal attacks with which madam du pre st maur m de raumur were displeased for this he was confined dungeon vincennes nothing can describe anguish i felt on account misfortunes my friend my wretched imagination which always sees everything worst light was terrified i imagined him be confined for remainder his life i was almost distracted with thought i wrote madam de pompadour beseeching her release him or obtain order shut me up same dungeon i received no answer my letter this was too reasonable be efficacious i do not flatter myself that it contributed alleviation which some time afterwards was granted severities confinement poor diderot had this continued for any length time with same rigor i verily believe i should have died despair at foot hated dungeon however if my letter produced but little effect i did not on account it attribute myself much merit for i mentioned it but very few people never diderot himself book viii at end preceding book pause was necessary with this begins long chain my misfortunes deduced from their origin having lived two most splendid houses paris i had notwithstanding my candor modesty made some acquaintance among others at dupin s that young hereditary prince saxe gotha baron de thun his governor at house m de la popliniere that m seguy friend baron de thun known literary world by his beautiful edition rousseau baron invited m seguy myself go pass day or two at fontenai sous bois where prince had house as i passed vincennes at sight dungeon my feelings were acute effect which baron perceived on my countenance at supper prince mentioned confinement diderot baron hear what i had say accused prisoner imprudence i showed not little same impetuous manner which i defended him this excess zeal inspired by misfortune which had befallen my friend was pardoned conversation immediately changed there were present two germans service prince m klupssel man great wit his chaplain who afterwards having supplanted baron became his governor other was young man named m grimm who served him as reader until he could obtain some place whose indifferent appearance sufficiently proved pressing necessity he was under immediately finding one from this very evening klupssel i began acquaintance which soon led friendship that with sieur grimm did not make quite so rapid progress he made but few advances was far from having that haughty presumption which prosperity afterwards gave him next day at dinner conversation turned upon music he spoke well on subject i was transported with joy when i learned from him he could play accompaniment on harpsichord after dinner was over music was introduced we amused ourselves rest afternoon on harpischord prince thus began that friendship which at first was so agreeable me afterwards so fatal which i shall hereafter have so much say at my return paris i learned agreeable news that diderot was released from dungeon that he had on his parole castle park vincennes for prison with permission see his friends how painful was it me not be able instantly fly him but i was detained two or three days at madam dupin s by indispensable business after ages impatience i flew arms my friend he was not alone d alembert treasurer sainte chapelle were with him as i entered i saw nobody but himself i made but one step one cry i riveted my face his i pressed him my arms without speaking him except by tears sighs i stifled him with my affection joy first thing he did after quitting my arms was turn himself towards ecclesiastic say you see sir how much i am beloved by my friends my emotion was so great that it was then impossible for me reflect upon this manner turning it advantage but i have since thought that had i been place diderot idea he manifested would not have been first that would have occurred me i found him much affected by his imprisonment dungeon had made terrible impression upon his mind although he was very agreeably situated castle at liberty walk where he pleased park which was not inclosed even by wall he wanted society his friends prevent him from yielding melancholy as i was person most concerned for his sufferings i imagined i should also be friend sight whom would give him consolation on which account notwithstanding very pressing occupations i went every two days at farthest either alone or accompanied by his wife pass afternoon with him heat summer was this year 1749 excessive vincennes is two leagues from paris state my finances not permitting me pay for hackney coaches at two o clock afternoon i went on foot when alone walked as fast as possible that i might arrive sooner trees by side road always lopped according custom country afforded but little shade exhausted by fatigue i frequently threw myself on ground being unable proceed any further i thought book my hand might make me moderate my pace one day i took mercure de france as i walked read i came following question proposed by academy dijon for premium ensuing year has progress sciences arts contributed corrupt or purify morals moment i had read this i seemed behold another world became different man although i have lively remembrance impression it made upon me detail has escaped my mind since i communicated it m de malesherbes one my four letters him this is one singularities my memory which merits be remarked it serves me proportion my dependence upon it moment i have committed paper that with which it was charged it forsakes me i have no sooner written thing than i had forgotten it entirely this singularity is same with respect music before i learned use notes i knew great number songs moment i had made sufficient progress sing air set music i could not recollect any one them at present i much doubt whether i should be able entirely go through one those which i was most fond all i distinctly recollect upon this occasion is that on my arrival at vincennes i was agitation which approached delirium diderot perceived it i told him cause read him prosopopoeia fabricius written with pencil under tree he encouraged me pursue my ideas become competitor for premium i did so from that moment i was ruined all rest my misfortunes during my life were inevitable effect this moment error my sentiments became elevated with most inconceivable rapidity level my ideas all my little passions were stifled by enthusiasm truth liberty virtue what is most astonishing this effervescence continued my mind upwards five years as great degree perhaps as it has ever done that any other man i composed discourse very singular manner that style which i have always followed my other works i dedicated it hours night which sleep deserted me i meditated my bed with my eyes closed my mind turned over over again my periods with incredible labor care moment they were finished my satisfaction i deposited them my memory until i had opportunity committing them paper but time rising putting on my clothes made me lose everything when i took up my pen i recollected but little what i had composed i made madam le vasseur my secretary i had lodged her with her daughter husband nearer myself she save me expense servant came every morning make my fire do such other little things as were necessary as soon as she arrived i dictated her while bed what i had composed night this method which for long time i observed preserved me many things i should otherwise have forgotten as soon as discourse was finished i showed it diderot he was satisfied with production pointed out some corrections he thought necessary be made however this composition full force fire absolutely wants logic order all works i ever wrote this is weakest reasoning most devoid number harmony with whatever talent man may be born art writing is not easily learned i sent off this piece without mentioning it anybody except i think grimm with whom after his going live with comte de vriese i began be upon most intimate footing his harpsichord served as rendezvous i passed with him at it all moments i had spare singing italian airs barcaroles sometimes without intermission from morning till night or rather from night until morning when i was not be found at madam dupin s everybody concluded i was with grimm at his apartment public walk or theatre i left off going comedie italienne which i was free go with him pay comedie francoise which he was passionately fond short so powerful attraction connected me with this young man i became so inseparable from him that poor aunt herself was rather neglected that is i saw her less frequently for no moment my life has my attachment her been diminished this impossibility dividing favor my inclinations little time i had myself renewed more strongly than ever desire i had long entertained having but one home for theresa myself but embarrassment her numerous family especially want money purchase furniture had hitherto withheld me from accomplishing it opportunity endeavor at it presented itself this i took advantage m de francueil madam dupin clearly perceiving that eight or nine hundred livres year were unequal my wants increased their own accord my salary fifty guineas madam dupin having heard i wished furnish myself lodgings assisted me with some articles for that purpose with this furniture that theresa already had we made one common stock having apartment hotel de languedoc rue de grenelle saint honore kept by very honest people we arranged ourselves best manner we could lived there peaceably agreeably during seven years at end which i removed go live at hermitage theresa s father was good old man very mild his disposition much afraid his wife for this reason he had given her surname lieutenant criminal which grimm jocosely afterwards transferred daughter madam le vasseur did not want sense that is address pretended politeness airs first circles but she had mysterious wheedling which me was insupportable gave bad advice her daughter endeavored make her dissemble with me separately cajoled my friends at my expense that each other excepting these circumstances she was tolerably good mother because she found her account being so concealed faults her daughter turn them her own advantage this woman who had so much my care attention whom i made so many little presents by whom i had it extremely at heart make myself beloved was from impossibility my succeeding this wish only cause uneasiness i suffered my little establishment except effects this cause i enjoyed during these six or seven years most perfect domestic happiness which human weakness is capable heart my theresa was that angel our attachment increased with our intimacy we were more more daily convinced how much we were made for each other could our pleasures be described their simplicity would cause laughter our walks tete tete on outside city where i magnificently spent eight or ten sous each guinguette ale house our little suppers at my window seated opposite each other upon two little chairs placed upon trunk which filled up spare embrasure this situation window served us as table we respired fresh air enjoyed prospect environs people who passed although upon fourth story looked down into street as we ate who can describe how few can feel charms these repasts consisting quartern loaf few cherries morsel cheese half pint wine which we drank between us friendship confidence intimacy sweetness disposition how delicious are your reasonings we sometimes remained this situation until midnight never thought hour unless informed it by old lady but let us quit these details which are either insipid or laughable i have always said felt that real enjoyment was not be described much about same time i indulged one not so delicate last kind with which i have reproach myself i have observed that minister klupssel was amiable man my connections with him were almost as intimate as those i had with grimm end became as familiar grimm he sometimes ate at my apartment these repasts little more than simple were enlivened by witty extravagant wantonness expression klupssel diverting germanicisms grimm who was not yet become purist sensuality did not preside at our little orgies but joy which was preferable reigned them all we enjoyed ourselves so well together that we knew not how separate klupssel had furnished lodging for little girl who notwithstanding this was at service anybody because he could not support her entirely himself one evening as we were going into coffee house we met him coming out go sup with her we rallied him he revenged himself gallantly by inviting us same supper there rallying us our turn poor young creature appeared be good disposition mild little fitted way life which old hag she had with her prepared her best manner she could wine conversation enlivened us such degree that we forgot ourselves amiable klupssel was unwilling do honors his table by halves we all three successively took view next chamber company with his little friend who knew not whether she should laugh or cry grimm has always maintained that he never touched her it was therefore amuse himself with our impatience that he remained so long other chamber if he abstained there is not much probability his having done so from scruple because previous his going live with comte de friese he lodged with girls town same quarter st roch i left rue des moineaux where this girl lodged as much ashamed as saint preux left house which he had become intoxicated when i wrote his story i well remembered my own theresa perceived by some sign especially by my confusion i had something with which i reproached myself i relieved my mind by my free immediate confession i did well for next day grimm came triumph relate her my crime with aggravation since that time he has never failed maliciously recall it her recollection this he was more culpable since i had freely voluntarily given him my confidence had right expect he would not make me repent it i never had more convincing proof than on this occasion goodness my theresa s heart she was more shocked at behavior grimm than at my infidelity i received nothing from her but tender reproaches which there was not least appearance anger simplicity mind this excellent girl was equal her goodness heart this is saying everything but one instance it which is present my recollection is worthy being related i had told her klupssel was minister chaplain prince saxe gotha minister was her so singular man that oddly confounding most dissimilar ideas she took it into her head take klupssel for pope i thought her mad first time she told me when i came that pope had called see me i made her explain herself lost not moment going relate story grimm klupssel who amongst ourselves never lost name pope we gave girl rue des moineaux name pope joan our laughter was incessant it almost stifled us they who letter which it hath pleased them attribute me have made me say i never laughed but twice my life did not know me at this period nor my younger days for if they had idea could never have entered into their heads year following 1750 not thinking more my discourse i learned it had gained premium at dijon this news awakened all ideas which had dictated it me gave them new animation completed fermentation my heart that first leaven heroism virtue which my father my country plutarch had inspired my infancy nothing now appeared great my eyes but be free virtuous superior fortune opinion independent all exterior circumstances although false shame fear disapprobation at first prevented me from conducting myself according these principles from suddenly quarreling with maxims age which i lived i from that moment took decided resolution do it this i purposely delayed execution that irritated by contradiction it might be rendered triumphant while i was philosophizing upon duties man event happened which made me better reflect upon my own theresa became pregnant for third time too sincere with myself too haughty my mind contradict my principles by my actions i began examine destination my children my connections with mother according laws nature justice reason those that religion pure holy eternal like its author which men have polluted while they pretended purify it which by their formularies they have reduced religion words since difficulty prescribing impossibilities is but trifling those by whom they are not practised if i deceived myself my conclusions nothing can be more astonishing than security with which i depended upon them were i one those men unfortunately born deaf voice nature whom no sentiment justice or humanity ever took least root this obduracy would be natural but that warmth heart strong sensibility facility forming attachments force with which they subdue me my cruel sufferings when obliged break them innate benevolence i cherished towards my fellow creatures ardent love i bear great virtues truth justice horror which i hold evil every kind impossibility hating injuring or wishing injure anyone soft lively emotion i feel at sight whatever is virtuous generous amiable can these meet same mind with depravity which without scruple treads under foot most pleasing all our duties no i feel openly declare this be impossible never his whole life could j j be man without sentiment or unnatural father i may have been deceived but it is impossible i should have lost least my feelings were i give my reasons i should say too much since they have seduced me they would seduce many others i will not therefore expose those young persons by whom i may be read same danger i will satisfy myself by observing that my error was such that abandoning my children public education for want means bringing them up myself destining them become workmen peasants rather than adventurers fortune hunters i thought i acted like honest citizen good father considered myself as member republic plato since that time regrets my heart have more than once told me i was deceived but my reason was so far from giving me same intimation that i have frequently returned thanks heaven for having by this means preserved them from fate their father that by which they were threatened moment i should have been under necessity leaving them had i left them madam d upinay or madam de luxembourg who from friendship generosity or some other motive offered take care them due time would they have been more happy better brought up or honester men this i cannot answer but i am certain they would have been taught hate perhaps betray their parents it is much better that they have never known them my third child was therefore carried foundling hospital as well as two former next two were disposed same manner for i have had five children all this arrangement seemed me be so good reasonable lawful that if i did not publicly boast it motive by which i was withheld was merely my regard for their mother but i mentioned it all those whom i had declared our connection diderot grimm afterwards m d epinay after another interval madam de luxembourg this freely voluntarily without being under least necessity doing it having it my power conceal step from all world for la gouin was honest woman very discreet person on whom i had greatest reliance only one my friends whom it was some measure my interest open myself was thierry physician who had care my poor aunt one her lyings which she was very ill word there was no mystery my conduct not only on account my never having concealed anything from my friends but because i never found any harm it everything considered i chose best destination for my children or that which i thought be such i could have wished still should be glad had i been brought up as they have been whilst i was thus communicating what i had done madam le vasseur did same thing amongst her acquaintance but with less disinterested views i introduced her her daughter madam dupin who from friendship me showed them greatest kindness mother confided her secret daughter madam dupin who is generous kind whom she never told how attentive i was her notwithstanding my moderate resources providing for everything provided on her part for what was necessary with liberality which by order her mother daughter concealed from me during my residence paris nor ever mentioned it until we were at hermitage when she informed me it after having disclosed me several other secrets her heart i did not know madam dupin who never took least notice me matter was so well informed i know not yet whether madam de chenonceaux her daughter law was as much secret but madam de brancueil knew whole could not refrain from prattling she spoke it me following year after i had left her house this induced me write her letter upon subject which will be found my collections wherein i gave such my reasons as i could make public without exposing madam le vasseur her family most determinative them came from that quarter these i kept profoundly secret i can rely upon discretion madam dupin friendship madam de chenonceaux i had same dependence upon that madam de francueil who however was long dead before my secret made its way into world this it could never have done except by means persons whom i intrusted it nor did it until after my rupture with them by this single fact they are judged without exculpating myself from blame i deserve i prefer it that resulting from their malignity my fault is great but it was error i have neglected my duty but desire doing injury never entered my heart feelings father were never more eloquent favor children whom he never saw but betraying confidence friendship violating most sacred all engagements publishing secrets confided us wantonly dishonoring friend we have deceived who detaching himself from our society still respects us are not faults but baseness mind last degree heinousness i have promised my confession not my justification on which account i shall stop here it is my duty faithfully relate truth that reader be just more than this i never shall require him marriage m de chenonceaux rendered his mother s house still more agreeable me by wit merit new bride very amiable young person who seemed distinguish me amongst scribes m dupin she was only daughter viscountess de rochechouart great friend comte de friese consequently grimm s who was very attentive her however it was i who introduced him her daughter but their characters not suiting each other this connection was not long duration grimm who from that time aimed at what was solid preferred mother woman world daughter who wished for steady friends such as were agreeable her without troubling her head about least intrigue or making any interest amongst great madam dupin no longer finding madam de chenonceaux all docility she expected made her house very disagreeable her madam de chenonceaux having great opinion her own merit perhaps her birth chose rather give up pleasures society remain almost alone her apartment than submit yoke she was not disposed bear this species exile increased my attachment her by that natural inclination which excites me approach wretched i found her mind metaphysical reflective although at times little sophistical her conversation which was by no means that young woman coming from convent had for me greatest attractions yet she was not twenty years age her complexion was seducingly fair her figure would have been majestic had she held herself more upright her hair which was fair bordering upon ash color uncommonly beautiful called my recollection that my poor mamma flower her age strongly agitated my heart but severe principles i had just laid down for myself by which at all events i was determined be guided secured me from danger her her charms during whole summer i passed three or four hours day tete tete conversation with her teaching her arithmetic fatiguing her with my innumerable ciphers without uttering single word gallantry or even once glancing my eyes upon her five or six years later i should not have had so much wisdom or folly but it was decreed i was never love but once my life that another person was have first last sighs my heart since i had lived house madam dupin i had always been satisfied with my situation without showing least sign desire improve it addition which conjunction with m de francueil she had made my salary was entirely their own accord this year m de francueil whose friendship for me daily increased had it his thoughts place me more at ease less precarious situation he was receiver general finance m dudoyer his cash keeper was old rich wished retire m de francueil offered me his place prepare myself for it i went during few weeks dudoyer take necessary instructions but whether my talents were ill suited employment or that m dudoyer who i thought wished procure his place for another was not earnest instructions he gave me i acquired by slow degrees very imperfectly knowledge i was want could never understand nature accounts rendered intricate perhaps designedly however without having possessed myself whole scope business i learned enough method pursue it without least difficulty i even entered on my new office i kept cashbook cash i paid received money took gave receipts although this business was so ill suited my inclinations as my abilities maturity years beginning render me sedate i was determined conquer my disgust entirely devote myself my new employment unfortunately for me i had no sooner begun proceed without difficulty than m de francueil took little journey during which i remained intrusted with cash which at that time did not amount more than twenty five thirty thousand livres anxiety mind this sum money occasioned me made me perceive i was very unfit be cash keeper i have no doubt but my uneasy situation during his absence contributed illness with which i was seized after his return i have observed my first part that i was born dying state defect bladder caused me during my early years suffer almost continual retention urine my aunt susan whose care i was intrusted had inconceivable difficulty preserving me however she succeeded my robust constitution at length got better all my weakness my health became so well established that except illness from languor which i have given account frequent heats bladder which least heating blood rendered troublesome i arrived at age thirty almost without feeling my original infirmity first time this happened was upon my arrival at venice fatigue voyage extreme heat i had suffered renewed burnings gave me pain loins which continued until beginning winter after having seen padoana i thought myself near end my career but i suffered not least inconvenience after exhausting my imagination more than my body for my zulietta i enjoyed better health than ever it was not until after imprisonment diderot that heat blood brought on by my journeys vincennes during terrible heat that summer gave me violent nephritic colic since which i have never recovered my primitive good state health at time which i speak having perhaps fatigued myself too much filthy work cursed receiver general s office i fell into worse state than ever remained five or six weeks my bed most melancholy state imaginable madam dupin sent me celebrated morand who notwithstanding his address delicacy his touch made me suffer greatest torments he advised me have recourse daran who fact gave me some relief but morand when he gave madam dupin account state i was declared her i should not be alive six months this afterwards came my ear made me reflect seriously on my situation folly sacrificing repose few days i had live slavery employment for which i felt nothing but disgust besides how was it possible reconcile severe principles i had just adopted situation with which they had so little relation should not i cash keeper receiver general finances have preached poverty disinterestedness with very ill grace these ideas fermented so powerfully my mind with fever were so strongly impressed that from that time nothing could remove them during my convalescence i confirmed myself with greatest coolness resolutions i had taken during my delirium i forever abandoned all projects fortune advancement resolved pass independence poverty little time i had exist i made every effort which my mind was capable break fetters prejudice courageously do everything that was right without giving myself least concern about judgment others obstacles i had combat efforts i made triumph over them are inconceivable i succeeded as much as it was possible i should greater degree than i myself had hoped for had i at same time shaken off yoke friendship as well as that prejudice my design would have been accomplished perhaps greatest at least most useful one virtue that mortal ever conceived but whilst i despised foolish judgments vulgar tribe called great wise i suffered myself be influenced led by persons who called themselves my friends these hurt at seeing me walk alone new path while i seemed take measures for my happiness used all their endeavors render me ridiculous that they might afterwards defame me first strove make me contemptible it was less my literary fame than my personal reformation which i here state period that drew upon me their jealousy they perhaps might have pardoned me for having distinguished myself art writing but they could never forgive my setting them by my conduct example which their eyes seemed reflect on themselves i was born for friendship my mind easy disposition nourished it without difficulty as long as i lived unknown public i was beloved by all my private acquaintance i had not single enemy but moment i acquired literary fame i had no longer friend this was great misfortune but still greater was that being surrounded by people who called themselves my friends used rights attached that sacred name lead me on destruction succeeding part these memoirs will explain this odious conspiracy i here speak its origin manner first intrigue will shortly appear independence which i lived it was however necessary subsist this effect i thought very simple means which were copying music at so much page if any employment more solid would have fulfilled same end i would have taken it up but this occupation being my taste only one which without personal attendance could procure me daily bread i adopted it thinking i had no longer need foresight stifling vanity cash keeper financier i made myself copyist music i thought i had made advantageous choice this i so little repented that i never quitted my new profession until i was forced do it after taking fixed resolution return it as soon as possible success my first discourse rendered execution this resolution more easy as soon as it had gained premium diderot undertook get it printed whilst i was my bed he wrote me note informing me publication effect it takes said he beyond all imagination never was there instance like success this favor public by no means solicited unknown author gave me first real assurance my talents which notwithstanding internal sentiment i had always had my doubts i conceived great advantage be drawn from it favor way life i had determined pursue was opinion that copyist some celebrity republic letters was not likely want employment moment my resolution was confirmed i wrote note m de francueil communicating him my intentions thanking him madam dupin for all goodness offering them my services way my new profession francueil did not understand my note thinking i was still delirium fever hastened my apartment but he found me so determined that all he could say me was without least effect he went madam dupin told her everybody he met that i had become insane i let him say what he pleased pursued plan i had conceived i began change my dress i quitted laced clothes white stockings i put on round wig laid aside my sword sold my watch saying myself with inexpressible pleasure thank heaven i shall no longer want know hour m de francueil had goodness wait considerable time before he disposed my place at length perceiving me inflexibly resolved he gave it m d alibard formerly tutor young chenonceaux known as botanist by his flora parisiensis i doubt not but these circumstances are now differently related by m francueil his consorts but i appeal what he said them at time long afterwards everybody he knew until forming conspiracy which men common sense honor must have preserved remembrance however austere my sumptuary reform might be i did not at first extend it my linen which was fine great quantity remainder my stock when at venice which i was particularly attached i had made it so much object cleanliness that it became one luxury which was rather expensive some persons however did me favor deliver me from this servitude on christmas eve whilst governesses were at vespers i was at spiritual concert door garret which all our linen was hung up after being washed was broken open everything was stolen amongst other things forty two my shirts very fine linen which were principal part my stock by manner which neighbors described man whom they had seen come out hotel with several parcels whilst we were all absent theresa myself suspected her brother whom we knew be worthless man mother strongly endeavored remove this suspicion but so many circumstances concurred prove it be well founded that notwithstanding all she could say our opinions remained still same i dared not make strict search for fear finding more than i wished do brother never returned place where i lived at length was no more heard by any us i was much grieved theresa myself should be connected with such family i exhorted her more than ever shake off so dangerous yoke this adventure cured me my inclination for fine linen since that time all i have had has been very common more suitable rest my dress having thus completed change that which related my person all my cares tendered render it solid lasting by striving root out from my heart everything susceptible receiving impression from judgment men or which from fear blame might turn me aside from anything good reasonable itself consequence success my work my resolution made some noise world also procured me employment so that i began my new profession with great appearance success however several causes prevented me from succeeding it same degree i should under any other circumstances have done first place my ill state health attack i had just had brought on consequences which prevented my ever being so well as i was before i am opinion physicians whose care i intrusted myself did me as much harm as my illness i was successively under hands morand daran helvetius malouin thyerri men able their profession all them my friends who treated me each according his own manner without giving me least relief weakened me considerably more i submitted their direction yellower thinner weaker i became my imagination which they terrified judging my situation by effect their drugs presented me on this side tomb nothing but continued sufferings from gravel stone retention urine everything which gave relief others ptisans baths bleeding increased my tortures perceiving bougees daran only ones that had any favorable effect without which i thought i could no longer exist give me momentary relief i procured prodigious number them that case daran s death i might never be at loss during eight or ten years which i made such frequent use these they must with what i had left have cost me fifty louis it will easily be judged that such expensive painful means did not permit me work without interruption that dying man is not ardently industrious business by which he gains his daily bread literary occupations caused another interruption not less prejudicial my daily employment my discourse had no sooner appeared than defenders letters fell upon me as if they had agreed with each do it my indignation was so raised at seeing so many blockheads who did not understand question attempt decide upon it imperiously that my answer i gave some them worst it one m gautier nancy first who fell under lash my pen was very roughly treated letter m grimm second was king stanislaus himself who did not disdain enter lists with me honor he did me obliged me change my manner combating his opinions i made use graver style but not less nervous without failing respect author i completely refuted his work i knew jesuit father de menou had been concerned it i depended on my judgment distinguish what was written by prince from production monk falling without mercy upon all jesuitical phrases i remarked as i went along anachronism which i thought could come from nobody but priest this composition which for what reason i knew not has been less spoken than any my other writings is only one its kind i seized opportunity which offered showing public what manner individual may defend cause truth even against sovereign it is difficult adopt more dignified respectful manner than that which i answered him i had happiness have do with adversary whom without adulation i could show every mark esteem which my heart was full this i did with success proper dignity my friends concerned for my safety imagined they already saw me bastile this apprehension never once entered my head i was right not being afraid good prince after reading my answer said i have enough at i will not return charge i have since that time received from him different marks esteem benevolence some which i shall have occasion speak what i had written was read france throughout europe without meeting least censure little time i had another adversary whom i had not expected this was same m bordes lyons who ten years before had shown me much friendship from whom i had received several services i had not forgotten him but had neglected him from idleness had not sent him my writings for want opportunity without seeking for it get them conveyed his hands i was therefore wrong he attacked me this however he did politely i answered same manner he replied more decidedly this produced my last answer after which i heard no more from him upon subject but he became my most violent enemy took advantage time my misfortunes publish against me most indecent libels made journey london on purpose do me injury all this controversy employed me good deal caused me great loss my time my copying without much contributing progress truth or good my purse pissot at that time my bookseller gave me but little for my pamphlets frequently nothing at all i never received farthing for my first discourse diderot gave it him i was obliged wait long time for little he gave me take it from him most trifling sums notwithstanding this my copying went on but slowly i had two things together upon my hands which was most likely means doing them both ill they were very opposite each other their effects by different manners living which they rendered me subject success my first writings had given me celebrity my new situation excited curiosity everybody wished know that whimsical man who sought not acquaintance any one whose only desire was live free happy manner he had chosen this was sufficient make thing impossible me my apartment was continually full people who under different pretences came take up my time women employed thousand artifices engage me dinner more unpolite i was with people more obstinate they became i could not refuse everybody while i made myself thousand enemies by my refusals i was incessantly slave my complaisance whatever manner i made my engagements i had not hour day myself i then perceived it was not so easy be poor independent as i had imagined i wished live by my profession public would not suffer me do it thousand means were thought indemnify me for time i lost next thing would have been showing myself like punch at so much each person i knew no dependence more cruel degrading than this i saw no other method putting end it than refusing all kinds presents great small let them come from whom they would this had no other effect than increase number givers who wished have honor overcoming my resistance force me spite myself be under obligation them many who would not have given me half crown had i asked it from them incessantly importuned me with their offers revenge for my refusal taxed me with arrogance ostentation it will naturally be conceived that resolutions i had taken system i wished follow were not agreeable madam le vasseur all disinterestedness daughter did not prevent her from following directions her mother governesses as gauffecourt called them were not always so steady their refusals as i was although many things were concealed from me i perceived so many as were necessary enable me judge that i did not see all this tormented me less by accusation connivance which it was so easy for me foresee than by cruel idea never being master my own apartments nor even my own person i prayed conjured became angry all no purpose mother made me pass for eternal grumbler man who was peevish ungovernable she held perpetual whisperings with my friends everything my little family was mysterious secret me that i might not incessantly expose myself noisy quarrelling i no longer dared take notice what passed it firmness which i was not capable would have been necessary withdraw me from this domestic strife i knew how complain but not how act they suffered me say what i pleased continued act as they thought proper this constant teasing daily importunities which i was subject rendered house my residence at paris disagreeable me when my indisposition permitted me go out i did not suffer myself be led by my acquaintance first one place then another i took walk alone reflected on my grand system something which i committed paper bound up between two covers which with pencil i always had my pocket this manner unforeseen disagreeableness situation i had chosen entirely led me back literature which unsuspectedly i had recourse as means releaving my mind thus first works i wrote i introduced peevishness ill humor which were cause my undertaking them there was another circumstance which contributed not little this thrown into world despite myself without having manners it or being situation adopt conform myself them i took it into my head adopt others my own enable me dispense with those society my foolish timidity which i could not conquer having for principle fear being wanting common forms i took by way encouraging myself resolution tread them under foot i became sour cynic from shame affected despise politeness which i knew not how practice this austerity conformable my new principles i must confess seemed ennoble itself my mind it assumed my eyes form intrepidity virtue i dare assert it be upon this noble basis that it supported itself longer better than could have been expected from anything so contrary my nature yet not withstanding i had name misanthrope which my exterior appearance some happy expressions had given me world it is certain i did not support character well private that my friends acquaintance led this untractable bear about like lamb that confining my sarcasms severe but general truths i was never capable saying uncivil thing any person whatsoever devin du village brought me completely into vogue presently after there was not man paris whose company was more sought after than mine history this piece which is kind era my life is joined with that connections i had at that time i must enter little into particulars make what is follow better understood i had numerous acquaintance yet no more than two friends diderot grimm by effect desire i have ever felt unite everything that is dear me i was too much friend both not make them shortly become so each other i connected them they agreed well together shortly become more intimate with each other than with me diderot had numerous acquaintance but grimm stranger new comer had his procure with greatest pleasure i procured him all i could i had already given him diderot i afterwards brought him acquainted with gauffecourt i introduced him madam chenonceaux madam d epinay baron d holbach with whom i had become connected almost spite myself all my friends became his this was natural but not one his ever became mine which was inclining contrary whilst he yet lodged at house comte de friese he frequently gave us dinners his apartment but i never received least mark friendship from comte de friese comte de schomberg his relation very familiar with grimm nor from any other person man or woman with whom grimm by their means had any connection i except abbe raynal who although his friend gave proofs his being mine cases need offered me his purse with generosity not very common but i knew abbe raynal long before grimm had any acquaintance with him had entertained great regard for him on account his delicate honorable behavior me upon slight occasion which i shall never forget abbe raynal is certainly warm friend this i saw proof much about time which i speak with respect grimm himself with whom he was very intimate grimm after having been sometime on footing friendship with mademoiselle fel fell violently love with her wished supplant cahusac young lady piquing herself on her constancy refused her new admirer he took this so much heart that appearance his affliction became tragical he suddenly fell into strangest state imaginable he passed days nights continued lethargy he lay with his eyes open although his pulse continued beat regularly without speaking eating or stirring yet sometimes seeming hear what was said him but never answering not even by sign remaining almost as immovable as if he had been dead yet without agitation pain or fever abbe raynal myself watched over him abbe more robust better health than i was by night i by day without ever both being absent at one time comte de friese was alarmed brought him senac who after having examined state which he was said there was nothing apprehend took his leave without giving prescription my fears for my friend made me carefully observe countenance physician i perceived him smile as he went away however patient remained several days almost motionless without taking anything except few preserved cherries which from time time i put upon his tongue which he swallowed without difficulty at length he one morning rose dressed himself returned his usual way life without either at that time or afterwards speaking me or abbe raynal at least that i know or any other person this singular lethargy or care we had taken him during time it lasted affair made noise it would really have been wonderful circumstance had cruelty opera girl made man die despair this strong passion brought grimm into vogue he was soon considered as prodigy love friendship attachments every kind such opinion made his company sought after procured him good reception first circles by which means he separated from me with whom he was never inclined associate when he could do it with anybody else i perceived him be on point breaking with me entirely for lively ardent sentiments which he made parade were those which with less noise pretensions i had really conceived for him i was glad he succeeded world but i did not wish him do this by forgetting his friend i one day said him grimm you neglect me i forgive you for it when first intoxication your success is over you begin perceive void your enjoyments i hope you will return your friend whom you will always find same sentiments at present do not constrain yourself i leave you at liberty act as you please wait your leisure he said i was right made his arrangements consequence shook off all restraint so that i saw no more him except company with our common friends our chief rendezvous before he was connected with madam d epinay as he afterwards became was at house baron d holbach this said baron was son man who had raised himself from obscurity his fortune was considerable he used it nobly receiving at his house men letters merit by knowledge he himself had acquired was very worthy holding place amongst them having been long attached diderot he endeavored become acquainted with me by his means even before my name was known world natural repugnancy prevented me long time from answering his advances one day when he asked me reason my unwillingness i told him he was too rich he was however resolved carry his point at length succeeded my greatest misfortune proceeded from my being unable resist force marked attention i have ever had reason repent having yielded it another acquaintance which as soon as i had any pretensions it was converted into friendship was that m duclos i had several years before seen him for first time at chevrette at house madam d epinay with whom he was upon very good terms on that day we only dined together he returned town afternoon but we had conversation few moments after dinner madam d epinay had mentioned me him my opera muses gallantes duclos endowed with too great talents not be friend those whom like were found was prepossessed my favor invited me go see him notwithstanding my former wish increased by acquaintance i was withheld by my timidity indolence as long as i had no other passport him than his complaisance but encouraged by my first success by his eulogiums which reached my ears i went see him he returned my visit thus began connection between us which will ever render him dear me by him as well as from testimony my own heart i learned that uprightness probity may sometimes be connected with cultivation letters many other connections less solid which i shall not here particularize were effects my first success lasted until curiosity was satisfied i was man so easily known that on next day nothing new was be discovered me however woman who at that time was desirous my acquaintance became much more solidly attached me than any those whose curiosity i had excited this was marchioness crequi niece m le bailli de froulay ambassador from malta whose brother had preceded m de montaigu embassy venice whom i had gone see on my return from that city madam de crequi wrote me i visited her she received me into her friendship i sometimes dined with her i met at her table several men letters amongst others m saurin author spartacus barnevelt etc since become my implacable enemy for no other reason at least that i can imagine than my bearing name man whom his father has cruelly persecuted it will appear that for copyist who ought be employed his business from morning till night i had many interruptions which rendered my days not very lucrative prevented me from being sufficiently attentive what i did do it well for which reason half time i had myself was lost erasing errors or beginning my sheet anew this daily importunity rendered paris more unsupportable made me ardently wish be country i several times went pass few days at mercoussis vicar which was known madam le vasseur with whom we all arranged ourselves such manner as not make things disagreeable him grimm once went thither with us since i have neglected relate here trifling but memorable adventure i had with said grimm one day on which we were dine at fountain st vandrille i will let it pass but when i thought it afterwards i concluded that he was brooding his heart conspiracy he has with so much success since carried into execution vicar had tolerable voice sung well although he did not read music learned his part with great facility precision we passed our time singing trios i had composed at chenonceaux these i added two or three new ones words grimm vicar wrote well or ill i cannot refrain from regretting these trios composed sung moments pure joy which i left at wootton with all my music mademoiselle davenport has perhaps curled her hair with them but they are worthy being preserved are for most part very good counterpoint it was after one these little excursions which i had pleasure seeing aunt at her ease very cheerful which my spirits were much enlivened that i wrote vicar very rapidly very ill epistle verse which will be found amongst my papers i had nearer paris another station much my liking with m mussard my countryman relation friend who at passy had made himself charming retreat where i have passed some very peaceful moments m mussard was jeweller man good sense who after having acquired

end his existence constantly increasing tumor his stomach prevented him from eating long before cause it was discovered after several years suffering absolutely occasioned him die hunger i can never without greatest affliction mind call my recollection last moments this worthy man who still received with so much pleasure leneips myself only friends whom sight his sufferings did not separate from him until his last hour when he was reduced devouring with his eyes repasts he had placed before us scarcely having power swallowing few drops weak tea which came up again moment afterwards but before these days sorrow how many have i passed at his house with chosen friends he had made himself at head list i place abbe prevot very amiable man very sincere whose heart vivified his writings worthy

oriental who i am opinion extended systems mussard on duration world female part his friends consisted madam denis niece voltaire who at that time was nothing more than good kind woman pretended not wit madam vanloo certainly not handsome but charming who sang like angel madam de valmalette herself who sang also who although very thin would have been very amiable had she had fewer pretensions such or very nearly such was society m mussard with which i should had been much pleased had not his conchyliomania more engaged my attention i can say with great truth that for upwards six months i worked with him his cabinet with as much pleasure as he felt himself he had long insisted upon virtue waters passy that they were proper my case recommended me come his house drink them withdraw myself from tumult city i at length consented went pass eight or ten days at passy which on account my being country were more service me than waters i drank during my stay there mussard played violincello was passionately found italian music this was subject long conversation we had one evening after supper particularly opera buffe we had both seen italy with which we were highly delighted my sleep having forsaken me night i considered what manner it would be possible give france idea this kind drama amours de ragonde did not least resemble it morning whilst i took my walk drank waters i hastily threw together few couplets which i adapted such airs as occurred me at moments i scribbled over what i had composed kind vaulted saloon at end garden at tea i could not refrain from showing airs mussard mademoiselle du vernois his gouvernante who was very good amiable girl three pieces composition i had sketched out were first monologue j ai perdu mon serviteur air devin l amour croit s il s inquiete last duo jamais colin je t engage etc i was so far from thinking it worth while continue what i had begun that had it not been for applause encouragement i received from both mussard mademoiselle i should have thrown my papers into fire thought no more their contents as i had frequently done by things much same merit but i was so animated by encomiums i received that six days my drama excepting few couplets was written music also was so far sketched out that all i had further do it after my return from paris was compose little recitative add middle parts whole which i finished with so much rapidity that three weeks my work was ready for representation only thing now wanting was divertissement which was not composed until long time afterwards my imagination was so warmed by composition this work that i had strongest desire hear it performed would have given anything have seen heard whole manner i should have chosen which would have been that lully who is said have had armide performed for himself only as it was not possible i should hear performance unaccompanied by public i could not see effect my piece without getting it received at opera unfortunately it was quite new species composition which ears public were not accustomed besides ill success muses gallantes gave too much reason fear for devin if i presented it my own name duclos relieved me from this difficulty engaged get piece rehearsed without mentioning author that i might not discover myself i did not go rehearsal petits violons by whom it was directed knew not who author was until after general plaudit had borne testimony work rebel frauneur who when they were very young went together from house house playing on violin were so called everybody present was so delighted with it that on next day nothing else was spoken different companies m de cury intendant des menus who was present at rehearsal demanded piece have it performed at court duclos who knew my intentions thought i should be less master my work at court than at paris refused give it cury claimed it authoratively duclos persisted his refusal dispute between them was carried such length that one day they would have gone out from opera house together had they not been separated m de cury applied me i referred him duclos this made it necessary return latter duke d aumont interfered at length duclos thought proper yield authority piece was given be played at fontainebleau part which i had been most attentive which i had kept at greatest distance from common track was recitative mine was accented manner entirely new accompanied utterance word directors dared not suffer this horrid innovation pass lest it should shock ears persons who never judge for themselves another recitative was proposed by francueil jelyotte which i consented but refused at same time have anything do with it myself when everything was ready day performance fixed proposition was made me go fontainebleau that i might at least be at last rehearsal i went with mademoiselle fel grimm i think abbe raynal one stages court rehearsal was tolerable i was more satisfied with it than i expected have been orchestra was numerous composed orchestras opera king s band jelyotte played colin mademoiselle fel colette cuvillier devin choruses were those opera i said but little jelyotte had prepared everything i was unwilling either approve or censure what he had done notwithstanding i had assumed air old roman i was midst so many people as bashful as schoolboy next morning day performance i went breakfast at coffee house du grand commun where i found great number people rehearsal preceding evening difficulty getting into theatre were subjects conversation officer present said he entered with greatest ease gave long account what had passed described author related what he had said done but what astonished me most this long narrative given with as much assurance as simplicity was that it did not contain syllable truth it was clear me that he who spoke so positively rehearsal had not been at it because without knowing him he had before his eyes that author whom he said he had seen examined so minutely however what was more singular still this scene was its effect upon me officer was man rather years he had nothing appearance coxcomb his features appeared announce man merit his cross saint louis officer long standing he interested me notwithstanding his impudence whilst he uttered his lies i blushed looked down was upon thorns i for some time endeavored within myself find means believing him be involuntary error at length trembling lest some person should know me by this means confound him i hastily drank my chocolate without saying word holding down my head i passed before him got out coffee house as soon as possible whilst company were making their remarks upon relation that had been given i was no sooner street than i was perspiration had anybody known named me before i left room i am certain all shame embarrassment guilty person would have appeared my countenance proceeding from what i felt poor man would have had have suffered had his lie been discovered i come one critical moments my life which it is difficult do anything more than relate because it is almost impossible that even narrative should not carry with it marks censure or apology i will however endeavor relate how upon what motives i acted with out adding either approbation or censure i was on that day same careless undress as usual with long beard wig badly combed considering this want decency as act courage i entered theatre wherein king queen royal family whole court were enter immediately after i was conducted box by m de cury which belonged him it was very spacious upon stage opposite lesser but more elevated one which king sat with madam de pompadour as i was surrounded by women only man front box i had no doubt my having been placed there purposely be exposed view as soon as theatre was lighted up finding i was midst people all extremely well dressed i began be less at my ease asked myself if i was my place whether or not i was properly dressed after few minutes inquietude yes replied i with intrepidity which perhaps proceeded more from impossibility retracting than force all my reasoning i am my place because i am going see my own piece performed which i have been invited for which reason only i am come here after all no person has greater right than i have reap fruit my labor talents i am dressed as usual neither better nor worse if i once begin subject myself public opinion i shall shortly become slave it everything be always consistent with myself i ought not blush any place whatever at being dressed manner suitable state i have chosen my exterior appearance is simple but neither dirty nor slovenly nor is beard either these itself because it is given us by nature according time place custom is sometimes ornament people think i am ridiculous nay even absurd but what signifies this me i ought know how bear censure ridicule provided i do not deserve them after this little soliloquy i became so firm that had it been necessary i could have been intrepid but whether it was effect presence his majesty or natural disposition those about me i perceived nothing but what was civil obliging curiosity which i was object this so much affected me that i began be uneasy for myself fate my piece fearing i should efface favorable prejudices which seemed lead nothing but applause i was armed against raillery but so far overcome by flattering obliging treatment i had not expected that i trembled like child when performance was begun i had soon sufficient reason be encouraged piece was very ill played with respect actors but musical part was well sung executed during first scene which was really delightful simplicity i heard boxes murmur surprise applause which relative pieces same kind had never yet happened fermentation was soon increased such degree as be perceptible through whole audience which speak after manner montesquieu effect was augmented by itself scene between two good little folks this effect was complete there is no clapping hands before king therefore everything was heard which was advantageous author piece i heard about me whispering women who appeared as beautiful as angels they said each other low voice this is charming that is ravishing there is not sound which does not go heart pleasure giving this emotion so many amiable persons moved me tears these i could not contain first duo when i remarked that i was not only person who wept i collected myself for moment on recollecting concert m de treitorens this reminiscence had effect slave who held crown over head general who triumphed but my reflection was short i soon abandoned myself without interruption pleasure enjoying my success however i am certain voluptuousness sex was more predominant than vanity author had none but men been present i certainly should not have had incessant desire i felt catching on my lips delicious tears i had caused flow i have known pieces excite more lively admiration but i never saw so complete delightful affecting intoxication senses reign during whole representation especially at court at first performance they who saw this must recollect it for it has never yet been equalled same evening duke d aumont sent desire me be at palace next day at eleven o clock when he would present me king m de cury who delivered me message added that he thought pension was intended that his majesty wished announce it me himself will it be believed that night so brilliant day was for me night anguish perplexity my first idea after that being presented was that my frequently wanting retire this had made me suffer very considerably at theatre might torment me next day when i should be gallery or king s apartment amongst all great waiting for passing his majesty my infirmity was principal cause which prevented me from mixing polite companies enjoying conversation fair idea alone situation which this want might place me was sufficient produce it such degree as make me faint away or recur means which my opinion death was much preferable none but persons who are acquainted with this situation can judge horror which being exposed risk it inspires i then supposed myself before king presented his majesty who deigned stop speak me this situation justness expression presence mind were peculiarly necessary answering would my timidity which disconcerts me presence any stranger whatever have been shaken off presence king france or would it have suffered me instantly make choice proper expressions i wished without laying aside austere manner i had adopted show myself sensible honor done me by so great monarch handsome merited eulogium convey some great useful truth i could not prepare suitable answer without exactly knowing what his majesty was say me had this been case i was certain that his presence i should not recollect word what i had previously meditated what said i will become me this moment before whole court if my confusion any my stupid expressions should escape me this danger alarmed terrified me i trembled such degree that at all events i was determined not expose myself it i lost it is true pension which some measure was offered me but i at same time exempted myself from yoke it would have imposed adieu truth liberty courage how should i afterwards have dared speak disinterestedness independence had i received pension i must either have become flatterer or remained silent moreover who would have insured me payment it what steps should i have been under necessity taking how many people must i have solicited i should have had more trouble anxious cares preserving than doing without it therefore i thought i acted according my principles by refusing sacrificing appearances reality i communicated my resolution grimm who said nothing against it others i alleged my ill state health left court morning my departure made some noise was generally condemned my reasons could not be known everybody it was therefore easy accuse me foolish pride thus not irritate jealousy such as felt they would not have acted as i had done next day jelyotte wrote me note which he stated success my piece pleasure it had afforded king all day long said he his majesty sings with worst voice his kingdom j ai perdu mon serviteur j ai perdu tout mon bonheur he likewise added that fortnight devin was be performed second time which confirmed eyes public complete success first two days afterwards about nine o clock evening as i was going sup with madam d epinay i perceived hackney coach pass by door somebody within made sign me approach i did so got into it found person be diderot he spoke pension with more warmth than upon such subject i should have expected from philosopher he did not blame me for having been unwilling be presented king but severely reproached me with my indifference about pension he observed that although on my own account i might be disinterested i ought not be so on that madam vasseur her daughter that it was my duty seize every means providing for their subsistence that as after all it could not be said i had refused pension he maintained i ought since king seemed disposed grant it me solicit obtain it by one means or another although i was obliged him for his good wishes i could not relish his maxims which produced warm dispute first i ever had with him all our disputes were this kind he prescribing me what he pretended i ought do i defending myself because i was different opinion it was late when we parted i would have taken him supper at madam d epinay s but he refused go notwithstanding all efforts which at different times desire uniting those i love induced me make prevail upon him see her even that conducting her his door which he kept shut against us he constantly refused do it never spoke her but with utmost contempt it was not until after i had quarrelled with both that they became acquainted that he began speak honorably her from this time diderot grimm seemed have undertaken alienate from me governesses by giving them understand that if they were not easy circumstances fault was my own that they never would be so with me they endeavored prevail on them leave me promising them privilege for retailing salt snuff shop i know not what other advantages by means influence madam d epinay they likewise wished gain over duclos d holbach but former constantly refused their proposals i had at time some intimation what was going forward but i was not fully acquainted with whole until long afterwards i frequently had reason lament effects blind indiscreet zeal my friends who my ill state health striving reduce me most melancholy solitude endeavored as they imagined render me happy by means which all others were most proper make me miserable carnival following conclusion year 1753 devin was performed at paris this interval i had sufficient time compose overture divertissement this divertissement such as it stands engraved was be action from beginning end continued subject which my opinion afforded very agreeable representations but when i proposed this idea at opera house nobody would so much as hearken me i was obliged tack together music dances usual manner on this account divertissement although full charming ideas which do not diminish beauty scenes succeeded but very middlingly i suppressed recitative jelyotte substituted my own such as i had first composed it as it is now engraved this recitative little after french manner i confess drawled out instead pronounced by actors far from shocking ears any person equally succeeded with airs seemed judgment public possess as much musical merit i dedicated my piece duclos who had given it his protection declared it should be my only dedication i have however with his consent written second but he must have thought himself more honored by exception than if i had not written dedication any person i could relate many anecdotes concerning this piece but things greater importance prevent me from entering into detail them at present i shall perhaps resume subject supplement there is however one which i cannot omit as it relates greater part what is follow i one day examined music d holbach his closet after having looked over many different kinds he said showing me collection pieces for harpsichord these were composed for me they are full taste harmony unknown everybody but myself you ought make selection from them for your divertissement having my head more subjects airs symphonies than i could make use i was not least anxious have any his however he pressed me so much that from motive complaisance i chose pastoral which i abridged converted into trio for entry companions colette some months afterwards whilst devin still continued be performed going into grimms i found several people about his harpsichord whence he hastily rose on my arrival as i accidently looked toward his music stand i there saw same collection baron d holbach opened precisely at piece he had prevailed upon me take assuring me at same time that it should never go out his hands some time afterwards i again saw collection open on harpischord m d papinay one day when he gave little concert neither grimm nor anybody else ever spoke me air my reason for mentioning it here is that some time afterwards rumor was spread that i was not author devin as i never made great progress practical part i am persuaded that had it not been for my dictionary music it would end have been said i did not understand composition sometime before devin du village was performed company italian bouffons had arrived at paris were ordered perform at opera house without effect they would produce there being foreseen although they were detestable orchestra at that time very ignorant mutilated at will pieces they gave they did french opera injury that will never be repaired comparison these two kinds music heard same evening same theatre opened ears french nobody could endure their languid music after marked lively accents italian composition moment bouffons had done everybody went away managers were obliged change order representation let performance bouffons be last egle pigmalion le sylphe were successively given nothing could bear comparison devin du village was only piece that did it this was still relished after la serva padrona when i composed my interlude my head was filled with these pieces they gave me first idea it i was however far from imagining they would one day be passed review by side my composition had i been plagiarist how many pilferings would have been manifest what care would have been taken point them out public but i had done nothing kind all attempts discover any such thing were fruitless nothing was found my music which led recollection that any other person my whole composition compared with pretended original was found be as new as musical characters i had invented had mondonville or rameau undergone same ordeal they would have lost much their substance bouffons acquired for italian music very warm partisans all paris was divided into two parties violence which was greater than if affair state or religion had been question one them most powerful numerous composed great men fortune ladies supported french music other more lively haughty fuller enthusiasm was composed real connoisseurs men talents genius this little group assembled at opera house under box belonging queen other party filled up rest pit theatre but heads were mostly assembled under box his majesty hence party names coin du roi coin de la reine king s corner queen s corner then great celebrity dispute as it became more animated produced several pamphlets king s corner aimed at pleasantry it was laughed at by petit prophete it attempted reason lettre sur la musique francoise refuted its reasoning these two little productions former which was by grimm latter by myself are only ones which have outlived quarrel all rest are long since forgotten but petit prophete which notwithstanding all i could say was for long time attributed me was considered as pleasantry did not produce least inconvenience author whereas letter on music was taken seriously incensed against me whole nation which thought itself offended by this attack on its music description incredible effect this pamphlet would be worthy pen tacitus great quarrel between parliament clergy was then at its height parliament had just been exiled fermentation was general everything announced approaching insurrection pamphlet appeared from that moment every other quarrel was forgotten perilous state french music was only thing by which attention public was engaged only insurrection was against myself this was so general that it has never since been totally calmed at court bastile or banishment was absolutely determined on lettre de cachet would have been issued had not m de voyer set forth most forcible manner that such step would be ridiculous were i say this pamphlet probably prevented revolution reader would imagine i was dream it is however fact truth which all paris can attest it being no more than fifteen years since date this singular fact although no attempts were made on my liberty i suffered numerous insults even my life was danger musicians opera orchestra humanely resolved murder me as i went out theatre this i received information but only effect it produced on me was make me more assiduously attend opera i did not learn until considerable time afterwards that m ancelot officer mousquetaires who had friendship for me had prevented effect this conspiracy by giving me escort which unknown myself accompanied me until i was out danger direction opera house had just been given hotel de ville first exploit performed by prevot des marchands was take from me my freedom theatre this most uncivil manner possible admission was publicly refused me on my presenting myself so that i was obliged take ticket that i might not that evening have mortification return as i had come this injustice was more shameful as only price i had set on my piece when i gave it managers was perpetual freedom house for although this was right common every author which i enjoyed under double title i expressly stipulated for it presence m duclos it is true treasurer brought me fifty louis for which i had not asked but besides smallness sum compared with that which according rule established such cases was due me this payment had nothing common with right entry formerly granted which was entirely independent it there was this behavior such complication iniquity brutality that public notwithstanding its animosity against me which was then at its highest was universally shocked at it many persons who insulted me preceding evening next day exclaimed open theatre that it was shameful thus deprive author his right entry particularly one who had so well deserved it was entitled claim it for himself another person so true is italian proverb ogn un ama la giustizia cosa d altrui every one loves justice affairs another this situation only thing i had do was demand my work since price i had agreed receive for it was refused me for this purpose i wrote m d argenson who had department opera i likewise enclosed him memoir which was unanswerable but this as well as my letter was ineffectual i received no answer either silence that unjust man hurt me extremely did not contribute increase very moderate good opinion i always had his character abilities it was this manner managers kept my piece while they deprived me that for which i had given it them from weak strong such act would be theft from strong weak it is nothing more than appropriation property without right with respect pecuniary advantages work although it did not produce me fourth part sum it would have done any other person they were considerable enough enable me subsist several years make amends for ill success copying which went on but very slowly i received hundred louis from king fifty from madam de pompadour for performance at bellevue where she herself played part colin fifty from opera five hundred livres from pissot for engraving so that this interlude which cost me no more than five or six weeks application produced notwithstanding ill treatment i received from managers my stupidity at court almost as much money as my emilius which had cost me twenty years meditation three years labor but i paid dearly for pecuniary ease i received from piece by infinite vexations it brought upon me it was germ secret jealousies which did not appear until long time afterwards after its success i did not remark either grimm diderot or any men letters with whom i was acquainted same cordiality frankness nor that pleasure seeing me i had previously experienced moment i appeared at baron s conversation was no longer general company divided into small parties whispered into each other s ears i remained alone without knowing whom address myself i endured for long time this mortifying neglect perceiving that madam d holbach who was mild amiable still received me well i bore with vulgarity her husband as long as it was possible but he one day attacked me without reason or pretence with such brutality presence diderot who said not word margency who since that time has often told me how much he admired moderation mildness my answers that at length driven from his house by this unworthy treatment i took leave with resolution never enter it again this did not however prevent me from speaking honorably him his house whilst he continually expressed himself relative me most insulting terms calling me that petit cuistre little college pedant or servitor college without however being able charge me with having done either himself or any person whom he was attached most trifling injury this manner he verified my fears predictions i am opinion my pretended friends would have pardoned me for having written books even excellent ones because this merit was not foreign themselves but that they could not forgive my writing opera nor brilliant success it had because there was not one amongst them capable same nor situation aspire like honors duclos only person superior jealousy seemed become more attached me he introduced me mademoiselle quinault whose house i received polite attention civility as great extreme as i had found want it that m d holbach whilst performance devin du village was continued at opera house author it had advantageous negotiation with managers french comedy not having during seven or eight years been able get my narcissis performed at italian theatre i had by bad performance french actors become disgusted with it should rather have had my piece received at french theatre than by them i mentioned this la none comedian with whom i had become acquainted who as everybody knows was man merit author he was pleased with piece promised get it performed without suffering name author be known meantime procured me freedom theatre which was extremely agreeable me for i always preferred it two others piece was favorably received without author s name being mentioned but i have reason believe it was known actors actresses many other persons mademoiselles gauffin grandval played amorous parts although whole performance was my opinion injudicious piece could not be said be absolutely ill played indulgence public for which i felt gratitude surprised me audience had patience listen it from beginning end permit second representation without showing least sign disapprobation for my part i was so wearied with first that i could not hold out end moment i left theatre i went into cafe de procope where i found boissi others my acquaintance who had probably been as much fatigued as myself i there humbly or haughtily avowed myself author piece judging it as everybody else had done this public avowal author piece which had not succeeded was much admired was by no means painful myself my self love was flattered by courage with which i made it i am opinion that on this occasion there was more pride speaking than there would have been foolish shame being silent however as it was certain piece although insipid performance would bear be read i had it printed preface which is one best things i ever wrote i began make my principles more public than i had before done i soon had opportunity explain them entirely work greatest importance for it was i think this year 1753 that programma academy dijon upon origin inequality mankind made its appearance struck with this great question i was surprised academy had dared propose it but since it had shown sufficient courage do it i thought i might venture treat it immediately undertook discussion that i might consider this grand subject more at my ease i went st germain for seven or eight days with theresa our hostess who was good kind woman one her friends i consider this walk as one most agreeable ones i ever took weather was very fine these good women took upon themselves all care expense theresa amused herself with them i free from all domestic concerns diverted myself without restraint at hours dinner supper all rest day wandering forest i sought for found there image primitive ages which i boldly traced history i confounded pitiful lies men i dared unveil their nature follow progress time things by which it has been disfigured comparing man art with natural man show them their pretended improvement real source all their misery my mind elevated by these contemplations ascended divinity thence seeing my fellow creatures follow blind track their prejudices that their errors misfortunes i cried out them feeble voice which they could not hear madmen know that all your evils proceed from yourselves from these meditations resulted discourse on inequality work more taste diderot than any my other writings which his advice was greatest service me at time i wrote this i had not least suspicion grand conspiracy diderot grimm otherwise i should easily have discovered how much former abused my confidence by giving my writings that severity melancholy which were not be found them from moments he ceased direct me passage philosopher who argues with himself stops his ears against complaints man distress is after his manner he gave me others still more extraordinary which i could never resolve make use but attributing this melancholy that he had acquired dungeon vincennes which there is very sufficient dose his clairoal i never once suspected least unfriendly dealing it was however understood but by few readers not one these would ever speak it i had written it become competitor for premium sent it away fully persuaded it would not obtain it well convinced it was not for productions this nature that academies were founded this excursion this occupation enlivened my spirits was service my health several years before tormented by my disorder i had entirely given myself up care physicians who without alleviating my sufferings exhausted my strength destroyed my constitution at my return from st germain i found myself stronger perceived my health be improved i followed this indication determined cure myself or die without aid physicians medicine i bade them forever adieu lived from day day keeping close when i found myself indisposed going abroad moment i had sufficient strength do it manner living paris amidst people pretensions was so little my liking cabals men letters their little candor their writings air importance they gave themselves world were so odious me i found so little mildness openness heart frankness intercourse even my friends that disgusted with this life tumult i began ardently wish reside country not perceiving that my occupation permitted me do it i went pass there all time i had spare for several months i went after dinner walk alone bois de boulogne meditating on subjects for future works not returning until evening gauffecourt with whom i was at that time extremely intimate being on account his employment obliged go geneva proposed me journey which i consented state my health was such as require care governess it was therefore decided she should accompany us that her mother should remain house after thus having made our arrangements we set off on first june 1754 this was period when at age forty two i for first time my life felt diminution my natural confidence which i had abandoned myself without reserve or inconvenience we had private carriage which with same horses we travelled very slowly i frequently got out walked we had scarcely performed half our journey when theresa showed greatest uneasiness at being left carriage with gauffecourt when notwithstanding her remonstrances i would get out as usual she insisted upon doing same walking with me i chid her for this caprice so strongly opposed it that at length she found herself obliged declare me cause whence it proceeded i thought i was dream my astonishment was beyond expression when i learned that my friend m de gauffecourt upwards sixty years age crippled by gout impotent exhausted by pleasures had since our departure incessantly endeavored corrupt person who belonged his friend was no longer young nor handsome by most base shameful means such as presenting her purse attempting inflame her imagination by reading abominable book by sight infamous figures with which it was filled theresa full indignation once threw his scandalous book out carriage i learned that on first evening our journey violent headache having obliged me retire bed before supper he had employed whole time this tete tete actions more worthy satyr than man worth honor whom i thought i had intrusted my companion myself what astonishment grief heart for me i who until then had believed friendship be inseparable from every amiable noble sentiment which constitutes all its charm for first time my life found myself under necessity connecting it with disdain withdrawing my confidence from man for whom i had affection by whom i imagined myself beloved wretch concealed from me his turpitude that i might not expose theresa i was obliged conceal from him my contempt secretly harbor my heart such sentiments as were foreign its nature sweet sacred illusion friendship gauffecourt first took veil from before my eyes what cruel hands have since that time prevented it from again being drawn over them at lyons i quitted gauffecourt take road savoy being unable be so near mamma without seeing her i saw her good god what situation how contemptible what remained her primitive virtue was it same madam de warens formerly so gay lively whom vicar pontverre had given me recommendations how my heart was wounded only resource i saw for her was quit country i earnestly but vainly repeated invitation i had several times given her my letters come live peacefully with me assuring her i would dedicate rest my life that theresa render her happy attached her pension from which although it was regularly paid she had not for long time received least advantage my offers were lost upon her i again gave her trifling part contents my purse much less than i ought have done considerably less than i should have offered her had not i been certain its not being least service herself during my residence at geneva she made journey into chablais came see me at grange canal she was want money continue her journey what i had my pocket was insufficient this purpose but hour afterwards i sent it her by theresa poor mamma i must relate this proof goodness her heart little diamond ring was last jewel she had left she took it from her finger put it upon that theresa who instantly replaced it upon that whence it had been taken kissing generous hand which she bathed with her tears ah this was proper moment discharge my debt i should have abandoned everything follow her share her fate let it be what it would i did nothing kind my attention was engaged by another attachment i perceived attachment i had her was abated by slender hopes there were rendering it useful either us i sighed after her my heart was grieved at her situation but i did not follow her all remorse i felt this was strongest most lasting i merited terrible chastisement with which i have since that time incessantly been overwhelmed may this have expiated my ingratitude this i appear guilty my conduct but my heart has been too much distressed by what i did ever have been that ungrateful man before my departure from paris i had sketched out dedication my discourse on inequality mankind i finished it at chambery dated it from that place thinking that avoid all chicane it was better not date it either from france or geneva moment i arrived that city i abandoned myself republican enthusiasm which had brought me it this was augmented by reception i there met with kindly treated by persons every description i entirely gave myself up patriotic zeal mortified at being excluded from rights citizen by possession religion different from that my forefathers i resolved openly return latter i thought gospel being same for every christian only difference religious opinions result explanations given by men that which they did not understand it was exclusive right sovereign power every country fix mode worship these unintelligible opinions that consequently it was duty citizen admit one conform other manner prescribed by law conversation encyclopaedists far from staggering my faith gave it new strength by my natural aversion disputes party study man universe had everywhere shown me final causes wisdom by which they were directed reading bible especially that new testament which i had for several years past applied myself had given me sovereign contempt for base stupid interpretations given words jesus christ by persons least worthy understanding his divine doctrine word philosophy while it attached me essential part religion had detached me from trash little formularies with which men had rendered it obscure judging that for reasonable man there were not two ways being christian i was also opinion that each country everything relative form discipline was within jurisdiction laws from this principle so social pacific which has brought upon me such cruel persecutions it followed that if i wished be citizen geneva i must become protestant conform mode worship established my country this i resolved upon i moreover put myself under instructions pastor parish which i lived which was without city all i desired was not appear at consistory however ecclesiastical edict was expressly that effect but it was agreed upon dispense with it my favor commission five or six members was named receive my profession faith unfortunately minister perdriau mild amiable man took it into his head tell me members were rejoiced at thoughts hearing me speak little assembly this expectation alarmed me such degree that having night day during three weeks studied little discourse i had prepared i was so confused when i ought have pronounced it that i could not utter single word during conference i had appearance most stupid schoolboy persons deputed spoke for me i answered yes no like blockhead i was afterwards admitted communion reinstated my rights as citizen i was enrolled as such lists guards paid by none but citizens burgesses i attended at council general extraordinary receive oath from syndic mussard i was so impressed with kindness shown me on this occasion by council consistory by great civility obliging behavior magistrates ministers citizens that pressed by worthy de luc who was incessant his persuasions still more so by my own inclination i did not think going back paris for any other purpose than break up housekeeping find situation for m madam le vasseur or provide for their subsistence then return with theresa geneva there settle for rest my days after taking this resolution i suspended all serious affairs better enjoy company my friends until time my departure all amusements which i partook that with which i was most pleased was sailing round lake boat with de luc father his daughter law his two sons my theresa we gave seven days this excursion finest weather possible i preserved lively remembrance situation which struck me at other extremity lake which i some years afterwards gave description my new eloisa principal connections i made at geneva besides de lucs which i have spoken were young vernes with whom i had already been acquainted at paris whom i then formed better opinion than i afterwards had him m perdriau then country pastor now professor belles lettres whose mild agreeable society will ever make me regret loss it although he has since thought proper detach himself from me m jalabert at that time professor natural philosophy since become counsellor syndic whom i read my discourse upon inequality but not dedication with which he seemed be delighted professor lullin with whom i maintained correspondence until his death who gave me commission purchase books for library professor vernet who like most other people turned his back upon me after i had given him proofs attachment

mezieres old friend my father s who had also shown himself be mine after having well deserved his country he became dramatic author pretending be council two hundred changed his principles before he died became ridiculous but he from whom i expected most was m moultou very promising young man by his talents his brilliant imagination whom i have always loved although his conduct with respect me was frequently equivocal not withstanding his being connected with my most cruel enemies whom i cannot but look upon as destined become defender my memory avenger his friend midst these dissipations i neither lost taste for my solitary excursions nor habit them i frequently made long ones upon banks lake during which my mind accustomed reflection did not remain idle i digested plan already formed my political institutions which i shall shortly have speak i meditated history valais plan tragedy prose subject which nothing less than lucretia did not deprive me hope succeeding although i had dared again exhibit that unfortunate heroine when she could no longer be suffered upon any french stage i at that time tried my abilities with tacitus translated first books his history which will be found amongst my papers after residence four months at geneva i returned month october paris avoided passing through lyons that i might not again have travel with gauffecourt as arrangement i had made

procured be printed holland by bookseller rey with whom i had just become acquainted at geneva this work was dedicated republic but as publication might be unpleasing council i wished wait until it had taken its effect at geneva before i returned thither this effect was not favorable me dedication which most pure patriotism had dictated created me enemies council inspired even many burgesses with jealousy m chouet at that time first syndic wrote me polite but very cold letter which will be found amongst my papers i received from private persons amongst others from du luc de jalabert few compliments these were all i did not perceive that single genevese was pleased with hearty zeal found work this indifference shocked all those by whom it was remarked i remember that dining one day at clichy at madam dupin s with crommelin resident from republic m de mairan latter openly declared council owed me present public honors for work that it would dishonor itself if it failed either crommelin who was black mischievous little man dared not reply my presence but he made frightful grimace which however forced smile from madam dupin only advantage this work procured me besides that resulting from satisfaction my own heart was title citizen given me by my friends afterwards by public after their example which i afterwards lost by having too well merited this ill success would not however have prevented my retiring geneva had not more powerful motives tended same effect m d epinay wishing add wing which was wanting chateau chevrette was at immense expense completing it going one day with madam d epinay see building we continued our walk quarter league further reservoir waters park which joined forest montmorency where there was handsome kitchen garden with little lodge much out repair called hermitage this solitary very agreeable place had struck me when i saw it for first time before my journey geneva i had exclaimed my transport ah madam what delightful habitation this asylum was purposely prepared for me madam d epinay did not pay much attention what i said but at this second journey i was quite surprised find instead old decayed building little house almost entirely new well laid out very habitable for little family three persons madam d epinay had caused this be done silence at very small expense by detaching few materials some work men from castle she now said me on remarking my surprise my dear here behold your asylum it is you who have chosen it friendship offers it you i hope this will remove from you cruel idea separating from me i do not think i was ever my life more strongly or more deliciously affected i bathed with tears beneficent hand my friend if i were not conquered from that very instant even i was extremely staggered madam d epinay who would not be denied became so pressing employed so many means so many people circumvent me proceeding even so far as gain over madam le vasseur her daughter that at length she triumphed over all my resolutions renouncing idea residing my own country i resolved i promised inhabit hermitage whilst building was drying madam d epinay took care prepare furniture so that everything was ready following spring illustration frontispiece one thing which greatly aided me determining was residence voltaire had chosen near geneva i easily comprehended this man would cause revolution there that i should find my country manners which drove me from paris that i should be under necessity incessantly struggling hard have no other alternative than that being unsupportable pedant poltroon or bad citizen letter voltaire wrote me on my last work induced me insinuate my fears my answer effect this produced confirmed them from that moment i considered geneva as lost i was not deceived i perhaps ought have met storm had i thought myself capable resisting it but what could i have done alone timid speaking badly against man arrogant opulent supported by credit great eloquent already idol women young men i was afraid uselessly exposing myself danger no purpose i listened nothing but my peaceful disposition my love repose which if it then deceived me still continues deceive me on same subject by retiring geneva i should have avoided great misfortunes but i have my doubts whether with all my ardent patriotic zeal i should have been able effect anything great useful for my country tronchin who about same time went reside at geneva came afterwards paris brought with him treasures at his arrival he came see me with chevalier jaucourt madam d epinay had strong desire consult him private but this it was not easy do she addressed herself me i engaged tronchin go see her thus under my auspices they began connection which was afterwards increased at my expense such has ever been my destiny moment i had united two friends who were separately mine they never failed combine against me although conspiracy then formed by tronchins they must all have borne me mortal hatred he still continued friendly me he even wrote me letter after his return geneva propose me place honorary librarian but i had taken my resolution offer did not tempt me depart from it about this time i again visited m d holbach my visit was occasioned by death his wife which as well as that madam francueil happened whilst i was at geneva diderot when he communicated me these melancholy events spoke deep affliction husband his grief affected my heart i myself was grieved for loss that excellent woman wrote m d holbach letter condolence i forgot all wrongs he had done me at my return from geneva after he had made tour france with grimm other friends alleviate his affliction i went see him continued my visits until my departure for hermitage as soon as it was known his circle that madam d epinay was preparing me habitation there innumerable sarcasms founded upon want i must feel flattery amusement city supposition my not being able support solitude for fortnight were uttered against me feeling within myself how i stood affected i left him his friends say what they pleased pursued my intention m d holbach rendered me some services finding place for old le vasseur who was eighty years age burden his wife from which she begged me relieve her this is instance treachery my memory long time after i had written what i have stated above i learned conversing with my wife that it was not m d holbach but m de chenonceaux then one administrators hotel dieu who procured this place for her father i had so totally forgotten circumstance idea m d holbach s having done it was so strong my mind that i would have sworn it had been him he was put into house charity where almost as soon as he arrived there age grief finding himself removed from his family sent him grave his wife all his children except theresa did not much regret his loss but she who loved him tenderly has ever since been inconsolable never forgiven herself for having suffered him at so advanced age end his days any other house than her own much about same time i received visit i little expected although it was from very old acquaintance my friend venture accompanied by another man came upon me one morning by surprise what change did i discover his person instead his former gracefulness he appeared sottish vulgar which made me extremely reserved with him my eyes deceived me or either debauchery had stupefied his mind or all his first splendor was effect his youth which was past i saw him almost with indifference we parted rather coolly but when he was gone remembrance our former connection so strongly called my recollection that my younger days so charmingly so prudently dedicated that angelic woman madam de warens who was not much less changed than himself little anecdotes that happy time romantic day toune passed with so much innocence enjoyment between those two charming girls from whom kiss hand was only favor which notwithstanding its being so trifling had left me such lively affecting lasting regrets ravishing delirium young heart which i had just felt all its force which i thought season forever past for me tender remembrance these delightful circumstances made me shed tears over my faded youth its transports for ever lost me ah how many tears should i have shed over their tardy fatal return had i foreseen evils i had yet suffer from them before i left paris i enjoyed during winter which preceded my retreat pleasure after my own heart which i tasted all its purity palissot academician nancy known by few dramatic compositions had just had one them performed at luneville before king poland he perhaps thought make his court by representing his piece man who had dared enter into literary dispute with king stanislaus who was generous did not like satire was filled with indignation at author s daring be personal his presence comte de tressan by order prince wrote m d alembert as well as myself inform me that it was intention his majesty have palissot expelled his academy my answer was strong solicitation favor palissot begging m de tressan intercede with king his behalf his pardon was granted m de tressan when he communicated me information name monarch added that whole what had passed should be inserted register academy i replied that this was less granting pardon than perpetuating punishment at length after repeated solicitations i obtained promise that nothing relative affair should be inserted register that no public trace should remain it promise was accompanied as well on part king as on that m de tressan with assurance esteem respect with which i was extremely flattered i felt on this occasion that esteem men who are themselves worthy it produced mind sentiment infinitely more noble pleasing than that vanity i have transcribed into my collection letters m de tressan with my answers them original former will be found amongst my other papers i am perfectly aware that if ever these memoirs become public i here perpetuate remembrance fact which i would wish efface every trace but i transmit many others as much against my inclination grand object my undertaking constantly before my eyes indispensable duty fulfilling it its utmost extent will not permit me be turned aside by trifling considerations which would lead me from my purpose my strange unparalleled situation i owe too much truth be further than this indebted any person whatever they who wish know me well must be acquainted with me every point view every relative situation both good bad my confessions are necessarily connected with those many other people i write both with same frankness everything that relates that which has befallen me am not obliged spare any person more than myself although it is my wish do it i am determined always be just true say others all good i can never speaking evil except when it relates my own conduct there is necessity for my so doing who situation which world has placed me has right require more at my hands my confessions are not intended appear during my lifetime nor that those they may disagreeably affect were i master my own destiny that book i am now writing it should never be made public until after my death theirs but efforts which dread truth obliges my powerful enemies make destroy every trace it render it necessary for me do everything which strictest right most severe justice will permit preserve what i have written were remembrance me be lost at my dissolution rather than expose any person alive i would without murmur suffer unjust momentary reproach but since my name is live it is my duty endeavor transmit with it posterity remembrance unfortunate man by whom it was borne such as he really was not such as his unjust enemies incessantly endeavored describe him book ix my impatience inhabit hermitage not permitting me wait until return fine weather moment my lodging was prepared i hastened take possession it great amusement coterie holbachique which publicly predicted i should not be able support solitude for three months that i should unsuccessfully return paris live there as they did for my part having for fifteen years been out my element finding myself upon eve returning it i paid no attention their pleasantries since contrary my inclinations i have again entered world i have incessantly regretted my dear charmettes agreeable life i led there i felt natural inclination retirement country it was impossible for me live happily elsewhere at venice train public affairs dignity kind representation pride projects advancement at paris vortex great world luxury suppers brilliancy spectacles rays splendor my groves rivulets solitary walks constantly presented themselves my recollection interrupted my thought rendered me melancholy made me sigh with desire all labor which i had subjected myself every project ambition which by fits had animated my ardor all had for object this happy country retirement which i now thought near at hand without having acquired genteel independence which i had judged be only means accomplishing my views i imagined myself my particular situation be able do without it that i could obtain same end by means quite opposite i had no regular income but i possessed some talents had acquired name my wants were few i had freed myself from all those which were most expensive which merely depended on prejudice opinion besides this although naturally indolent i was laborious when i chose be so my idleness was less that indolent man than that independent one who applies business when it pleases him my profession copyist music was neither splendid nor lucrative but it was certain world gave me credit for courage i had shown making choice it i might depend upon having sufficient employment enable me live two thousand livres which remained produce devin du village my other writings were sum which kept me from being straitened several works i had upon stocks promised me without extorting money from booksellers supplies sufficient enable me work at my ease without exhausting myself even by turning advantage leisure my walks my little family consisting three persons all whom were usefully employed was not expensive support finally from my resources proportioned my wants desires i might reasonably expect happy permanent existence that manner life which my inclination had induced me adopt i might have taken interested side question instead subjecting my pen copying entirely devoted it works which from elevation which i had soared at which i found myself capable continuing might have enabled me live midst abundance nay even opulence had i been least disposed join manoeuvres author care publishing good book but i felt that writing for bread would soon have extinguished my genius destroyed my talents which were less my pen than my heart solely proceeded from elevated noble manner thinking by which alone they could be cherished preserved nothing vigorous or great can come from pen totally venal necessity nay even avarice perhaps would have made me write rather rapidly than well if desire success had not led me into cabals it might have made me endeavor publish fewer true useful works than those which might be pleasing multitude instead distinguished author which i might possibly become i should have been nothing more than scribbler no i have always felt that profession letters was illustrious proportion as it was less trade it is too difficult think nobly when we think for livelihood be able dare even speak great truths author must be independent success i gave my books public with certainty having written for general good mankind without giving myself least concern about what was follow if work was thrown aside so much worse for such as did not choose profit by it their approbation was not necessary enable me live my profession was sufficient maintain me had not my works had sale for which reason alone they all sold it was on ninth august 1756 that i left cities never reside them again for i do not call residence few days i afterwards remained paris london or other cities always on wing or contrary my inclinations madam d epinay came took us all three her coach her farmer carted away my little baggage i was put into possession same day i found my little retreat simply furnished but neatly with some taste hand which had lent its aid this furnishing rendered it inestimable my eyes i thought it charming be guest my female friend house i had made choice which she had caused be built purposely for me although weather was cold ground lightly covered with snow earth began vegetate violets primroses already made their appearance trees began bud evening my arrival was distinguished by song nightingale which was heard almost under my window wood adjoining house after light sleep forgetting when i awoke my change abode i still thought myself rue grenelle when suddenly this warbling made me give start i exclaimed my transport at length all my wishes are accomplished first thing i did was abandon myself impression rural objects with which i was surrounded instead beginning set things order my new habitation i began by doing it for my walks there was not path copse grove nor corner environs my place residence that i did not visit next day more i examined this charming retreat more i found it my wishes this solitary rather than savage spot transported me idea end world it had striking beauties which are but seldom found near cities never if suddenly transported thither could any person have imagined himself within four leagues paris after abandoning myself for few days this rural delirium i began arrange my papers regulate my occupations i set apart as i had always done my mornings copying my afternoons walking provided with my little paper book pencil for never having been able write think at my ease except sub dio i had no inclination depart from this method i was persuaded forest montmorency which was almost at my door would future be my closet study i had several works begun these i cast my eye over my mind was indeed fertile great projects but noise city execution them had gone on but slowly i proposed myself use more diligence when i should be less interrupted i am opinion i have sufficiently fulfilled this intention for man frequently ill often at la chevrette at epinay at raubonne at castle montmorency at other times interrupted by indolent curious always employed half day copying if what i produced during six years i passed at hermitage at montmorency be considered i am persuaded it will appear that if this interval i lost my time it was not idleness different works i had upon stocks that i had longest resolved my mind which was most my taste which i destined certain portion my life which my opinion was confirm reputation i had acquired was my institutions politiques i had fourteen years before when at venice where i had opportunity remarking defects that government so much boasted conceived first idea them since that time my views had become much more extended by historical study morality i had perceived everything be radically connected with politics that upon whatever principles these were founded people would never be more than that which nature government made them therefore great question best government possible appeared me be reduced this what is nature government most proper form most virtuous enlightened wisest best people taking last epithet its most extensive meaning i thought this question was much if not quite same nature with that which follows what government is that which by its nature always maintains itself nearest laws or least deviates from laws hence what is law series questions similar importance i perceived these led great truths useful happiness mankind but more especially that my country wherein journey i had just made it i had not found notions laws liberty either sufficiently just or clear i had thought this indirect manner communicating these my fellow citizens would be least mortifying their pride might obtain me forgiveness for having seen little further than themselves although i had already labored five or six years at work progress i had made it was not considerable writings this kind require meditation leisure tranquillity i had besides written institutions politiques as expression is en bonne fortune had not communicated my project any person not even diderot i was afraid it would be thought too daring for age country which i wrote that fears my friends would restrain me from carrying it into execution it was more especially wise severity duclos which inspired me with this fear as for diderot i know not by what means all my conferences with him tended make me more satirical than my natural disposition inclined me be this prevented me from consulting him upon undertaking which i wished introduce nothing but force reasoning without least appearance ill humor or partiality manner this work may be judged by that contrat social which is taken from it i did not yet know that it would be finished time such manner as appear before my decease i wished fearlessly give my subject everything it required fully persuaded that not being satirical turn never wishing be personal i should equity always be judged irreprehensible i undoubtedly wished fully enjoy right thinking which i had by birth but still respecting government under which i lived without ever disobeying its laws very attentive not violate rights persons i would not from fear renounce its advantages i confess even that as stranger living france i found my situation very favorable daring speak truth well knowing that continuing as i was determined do not print anything kingdom without permission i was not obliged give any person it account my maxims nor their publication elsewhere i should have been less independent even at geneva where whatever place my books might have been printed magistrate had right criticise their contents this consideration had greatly contributed make me yield solicitations madam d epinay abandon project fixing my residence at geneva i felt as i have remarked my emilius that unless author be man intrigue when he wishes render his works really useful any country whatsoever he must compose them some other what made me find my situation still more happy was my being persuaded that government france would perhaps without looking upon me with very favorable eye make it point protect me or at least not disturb my tranquillity it appeared me stroke simple yet dexterous policy make merit tolerating that which there was no means preventing since had i been driven from france which was all government had right do my work would still have been written perhaps with less reserve whereas if i were left undisturbed author remained answer for what he wrote prejudice general throughout all europe would be destroyed by acquiring reputation observing proper respect for rights persons they who by event shall judge i was deceived may perhaps be deceived their turn storm which has since broken over my head my books served as pretence but it was against my person that every shaft was directed my persecutors gave themselves but little concern about author but they wished ruin jean jacques greatest evil they found my writings was honor they might possibly do me let us not encroach upon future i do not know that this mystery which is still one me will hereafter be cleared up my readers but had my avowed principles been nature bring upon me treatment i received i should sooner have become their victim since work which these principles are manifested with most courage not call it audacity seemed have had its effect previous my retreat hermitage without i will not only say my having received least censure but without any steps having been taken prevent publication it france where it was sold as publicly as holland new eloisa afterwards appeared with same facility i dare add with same applause what seems incredible profession faith this eloisa at point death is exactly similar that savoyard vicar every strong idea social contract had been before published discourse on inequality every bold opinion emilius previously found eloisa this unrestrained freedom did not excite least murmur against first two works therefore it was not that which gave cause it against latter another undertaking much same kind but which project was more recent then engaged my attention this was extract works abbe de saint pierre which having been led away by thread my narrative i have not hitherto been able speak idea was suggested me after my return from geneva by abbe malby not immediately from himself but by interposition madam dupin who had some interest engaging me adopt it she was one three or four pretty women paris whom abbe de saint pierre had been spoiled child although she had not decidedly had preference she had at least partaken it with madam d aiguillon she preserved for memory good man respect affection which did honor them both her self love would have been flattered by seeing still born works her friend brought life by her secretary these works contained excellent things but so badly told that reading them was almost insupportable it is astonishing abbe de saint pierre who looked upon his readers as schoolboys should nevertheless have spoken them as men by little care he took induce them give him hearing it was for this purpose that work was proposed me as useful itself very proper for man laborious manoeuvre but idle as author who finding trouble thinking very fatiguing preferred things which pleased him throwing light upon extending ideas others producing any himself besides not being confined functions translator i was at liberty sometimes think for myself i had it my power give such form my work that many important truths would pass it under name abbe de saint pierre much more safely than under mine undertaking also was not trifling business was nothing less than read meditate twenty three volumes diffuse confused full long narrations periods repetitions false or little views from amongst which it was necessary select some few that were good useful sufficiently encouraging enable me support painful labor i frequently wished have given it up should have done so could i have got it off my hands with great grace but when i received manuscripts abbe which were given me by his nephew comte de saint pierre i had by solicitation st lambert some measure engaged make use them which i must either have done or have given them back it was with former intention i had taken manuscripts hermitage this was first work which i proposed dedicate my leisure hours i had likewise my own mind projected third idea which i owed observations i had made upon myself i felt more disposed undertake this work as i had reason hope i could make it truly useful one perhaps most so any that could be offered world were execution equal plan i had laid down it has been remarked that most men are course their lives frequently unlike themselves seem be transformed into others very different from what they were it was not establish thing so generally known that i wished write book i had newer more important object this was search for causes these variations by confining my observations those which depend on ourselves demonstrate what manner it might be possible direct them order render us better more certain our dispositions for it is undoubtedly more painful honest man resist desires already formed which it is his duty subdue than prevent change or modify same desires their source were he capable tracing them it man under temptation resists once because he has strength mind he yields another time because this is overcome had it been same as before he would again have triumphed by examining within myself searching others what could be cause these different manners being i discovered that great measure they depended on anterior impressions external objects that continually modified by our senses organs we without knowing it bore our ideas sentiments even actions effect these modifications striking numerous observations i had collected were beyond all manner dispute by their natural principle seemed proper furnish exterior regimen which varied according circumstances might place support mind state most favorable virtue from how many mistakes would reason be preserved how many vices would be stifled their birth were it possible force animal economy favor moral order which it so frequently disturbs climate seasons sounds colors light darkness elements ailments noise silence motion rest all act on animal machine consequently on mind all offer thousand means almost certain directing their origin sentiments by which we suffer ourselves be governed such was fundamental idea which i had already made sketch upon paper whence i hoped for effect more certain favor persons well disposed who sincerely loving virtue were afraid their own weakness as it appeared me easy make it book as agreeable read as it was compose i have however applied myself but very little this work title which was have been morale sensitive ou le materialisme du sage interruptions cause which will soon appear prevented me from continuing it fate sketch which is more connected with my own than it may appear be will hereafter be seen besides this i had for some time meditated system education which madam de chenonceaux alarmed for her son by that her husband had desired me consider authority friendship placed this object although less itself my taste nearer my heart than any other on which account this subject all those which i have just spoken is only one i carried its utmost extent end i proposed myself treating it should i think have procured author better fate but i will not here anticipate this melancholy subject i shall have too much reason speak it course my work these different objects offered me subjects meditation for my walks for as i believed i had already observed i am unable reflect when i am not walking moment i stop i think no more as soon as i am again motion my head resumes its workings i had however provided myself with work for closet upon rainy days this was my dictionary music which my scattered mutilated unshapen materials made it necessary rewrite almost entirely i had with me some books necessary this purpose i had spent two months making extracts from others i had borrowed from king s library whence i was permitted take several hermitage i was thus provided with materials for composing my apartment when weather did not permit me go out my copying fatigued me this arrangement was so convenient that it made it turn advantage as well at hermitage as at montmorency afterwards even at motiers where i completed work whilst i was engaged others constantly found change occupation be real relaxation during considerable time i exactly followed distribution i had prescribed myself found it very agreeable but as soon as fine weather brought madam d epinay more frequently epinay or chervette i found that attentions first instance natural me but which i had not considered my scheme considerably deranged my projects i have already observed that madam d epinay had many amiable qualities she sincerely loved her friends served them with zeal not sparing for them either time or pains certainly deserved on their part every attention return i had hitherto discharged this duty without considering it as one but at length i found that i had given myself chain which nothing but friendship prevented me from feeling weight this was still aggravated by my dislike numerous societies madam d epinay took advantage these circumstances make me proposition seemingly agreeable me but which was more so herself this was let me know when she was alone or had but little company i consented without perceiving what degree i engaged myself consequence was that i no longer visited her at my own hour but at hers that i never was certain being master myself for day together this constraint considerably diminished pleasure i had going see her i found liberty she had so frequently promised was given me upon no other condition than that my never enjoying it once or twice when i wished do this there were so many messages notes alarms relative my health that i perceived that i could have no excuse but being confined my bed for not immediately running her upon first intimation it was necessary i should submit this yoke i did it even more voluntarily than could be expected from so great enemy dependence sincere attachment i had madam d epinay preventing me great measure from feeling inconvenience with which it was accompanied she on her part filled up well or ill void which absence her usual circle left her amusements this for her was but very slender supplement although preferable absolute solitude which she could not support she had means doing it much more at her ease after she began with literature at all events write novels letters comedies tales other trash same kind but she was not so much amused writing these as reading them she never scribbled over two or three pages at one sitting without being previously assured having at least two or three benevolent auditors at end so much labor i seldom had honor being one chosen few except by means another when alone i was for most part considered as cipher everything this not only company madam d epinay but that m d holbach every place where grimm gave ton this nullity was very convenient me except tete tete when i knew not what countenance put on not daring speak literature which it was not for me say word nor gallantry being too timid fearing more than death ridiculousness old gallant besides that i never had such idea when company madam d epinay that it perhaps would never have occurred me had i passed my whole life with her not that her person was least disagreeable me on contrary i loved her perhaps too much as friend do it as lover i felt pleasure seeing speaking her her conversation although agreeable enough mixed company was uninteresting private mine not more elegant or entertaining than her own was no great amusement her ashamed being long silent i endeavored enliven our tete tete although this frequently fatigued me i was never disgusted with it i was happy show her little attentions gave her little fraternal kisses which seemed not be more sensual herself these were all she was very thin very pale had bosom which resembled back her hand this defect alone would have been sufficient moderate my most ardent desires my heart never could distinguish woman person who had it besides other causes useless mention always made me forget sex this lady having resolved conform assiduity which was necessary i immediately voluntarily entered upon it for first year at least found it less burthensome than i could have expected madam d epinay who commonly passed summer country continued there but part this whether she was more detained by her affairs paris or that absence grimm rendered residence chevrette less agreeable her i know not i took advantage intervals her absence or when company with her was numerous enjoy my solitude with my good theresa her mother such manner as taste all its charms although i had for several years past been frequently country i seldom had enjoyed much its pleasures these excursions always made company with people who considered themselves as persons consequence rendered insipid by constraint served increase me natural desire i had for rustic pleasures want these was more sensible me as i had image them immediately before my eyes i was so tired saloons jets d eau groves parterres more fatiguing persons by whom they were shown so exhausted with pamphlets harpsichords trios unravellings plots stupid bon mots insipid affections pitiful storytellers great suppers that when i gave side glance at poor simple hawthorn bush hedge barn or meadow when passing through hamlet i scented good chervil omelette heard at distance burden rustic song bisquieres i wished all rouge furbelows ambergris at devil envying dinner good housewife wine her own vineyard i heartily wished give slap on chaps monsieur le chef monsieur le maitre who made me dine at hour supper sup when i should have been asleep but especially messieurs lackeys who devoured with their eyes morsel i put into my mouth upon pain my dying with thirst sold me adulterated wine their master ten times dearer than that better quality would have cost me at public house at length i was settled agreeable solitary asylum at liberty pass there remainder my days that peaceful equal independent life for which i felt myself born before i relate effects this situation so new me had upon my heart it is proper i should recapitulate its secret affections that reader may better follow their causes progress these new modifications i have always considered day on which i was united theresa as that which fixed my moral existence attachment was necessary for me since that which should have been sufficient my heart had been so cruelly broken thirst after happiness is never extinguished heart man mamma was advancing into years dishonored herself i had proofs that she could never more be happy here below it therefore remained me seek my own happiness having lost all hopes partaking hers i was sometimes irresolute fluctuated from one idea another from project project my journey venice would have thrown me into public life had man with whom almost against my inclination i was connected there had common sense i was easily discouraged especially undertakings length difficulty ill success this disgusted me with every other according my old maxims considering distant objects as deceitful allurements i resolved future provide for immediate wants seeing nothing life which could tempt me make extraordinary efforts it was precisely at this time we became acquainted mild character good theresa seemed so fitted my own that i united myself her with attachment which neither time nor injuries have been able impair which has constantly been increased by everything by which it might have been expected be diminished force this sentiment will hereafter appear when i come speak wounds she has given my heart height my misery without my ever having until this moment once uttered word complaint any person whatever when it shall be known that after having done everything braved everything not separate from her that after passing with her twenty years despite fate men i have my old age made her my wife without least expectation or solicitation on her part or promise or engagement on mine world will think that love bordering upon madness having from first moment turned my head led me by degrees last act extravagance this will no longer appear doubtful when strong particular reasons which should forever have prevented me from taking such step are made known what therefore will reader think when i shall have told him with all truth he has ever found me that from first moment which i saw her until that wherein i write i have never felt least love for her that i never desired possess her more than i did possess madam de warens that physical wants which were satisfied with her person were me solely those sex by no means proceeding from individual he will think that being constitution different from that other men i was incapable love since this was not one sentiments which attached me women most dear my heart patience o my dear reader fatal moment approaches which you will be but too much undeceived i fall into repetitions i know it these are necessary first my wants greatest strongest most insatiable was wholly my heart want intimate connection as intimate as it could possibly be for this reason especially woman was more necessary me than man female rather than male friend this singular want was such that closest corporal union was not sufficient two souls would have been necessary me same body without which i always felt void i thought i was upon point filling it up forever this young person amiable by thousand excellent qualities at that time by her form without shadow art or coquetry would have confined within herself my whole existence could hers as i had hoped it would have been totally confined me i had nothing fear from men i am certain being only man she ever really loved her moderate passions seldom wanted another not even after i ceased this respect be one her i had no family she had one this family was composed individuals whose dispositions were so different from mine that i could never make it my own this was first cause my unhappiness what would i not have given be child her mother i did everything my power become so but could never succeed i vain attempted unite all our interests this was impossible she always created herself one different from mine contrary it that even her daughter which already was no longer separated from it she her other children grand children became so many leeches least evil these did theresa was robbing her poor girl accustomed submit even her nieces suffered herself be pilfered governed without saying word i perceived with grief that by exhausting my purse giving her advice i did nothing that could be any real advantage her i endeavored detach her from her mother but she constantly resisted such proposal i could not but respect her resistance esteemed her more for it but her refusal was not on this account less prejudice us both abandoned her mother rest her family she was more their companion than mine rather at their command than mistress herself their avarice was less ruinous than their advice was pernicious her fact if on account love she had for me added her good natural disposition she was not quite their slave she was enough so prevent great measure effect good maxims i endeavored instil into her notwithstanding all my efforts prevent our being united thus was it that notwithstanding sincere reciprocal attachment which i had lavished all tenderness my heart void that heart was never completely filled children by whom this effect should have been produced were brought into world but these only made things worse i trembled at thought intrusting them family ill brought up be still worse educated risk education foundling hospital was much less this reason for resolution i took much stronger than all those i stated my letter madam de francueil was however only one with which i dared not make her acquainted i chose rather appear less excusable than expose reproach family person i loved but by conduct her wretched brother notwithstanding all that can be said his defence it will be judged whether or not i ought have exposed my children education similar his not having it my power taste all its plentitude charms that intimate connection which i felt want i sought for substitutes which did not fill up void yet they made it less sensible not having friend entirely devoted me i wanted others whose impulse should overcome my indolence for this reason i cultivated strengthened my connection with diderot abbe de condillac formed with grimm new one still more intimate till at length by unfortunate discourse which i have related some particulars i unexpectedly found myself thrown back into literary circle which i thought i had quitted forever my first steps conducted me by new path another intellectual world simple noble economy which i cannot contemplate without enthusiasm i reflected so much on subject that i soon saw nothing but error folly doctrine our sages oppression misery our social order illusion my foolish pride i thought myself capable destroying all imposture thinking that make myself listened it was necessary my conduct should agree with my principles i adopted singular manner life which i have not been permitted continue example which my pretended friends have never forgiven me which at first made me ridiculous would at length have rendered me respectable had it been possible for me persevere until then i had been good from that moment i became virtuous or at least infatuated with virtue this infatuation had begun my head but afterwards passed into my heart most noble pride there took root amongst ruins extirpated vanity i affected nothing i became what i appeared be during four years at least whilst this effervescence continued at its greatest height there is nothing great good that can enter heart man which i was not capable between heaven myself hence flowed my sudden eloquence hence my first writings that fire really celestial which consumed me whence during forty years not single spark had escaped because it was not yet lighted up i was really transformed my friends acquaintance scarcely knew me i was no longer that timid rather bashful than modest man who neither dared present himself nor utter word whom single pleasantry disconcerted whose face was covered with blush moment his eyes met those woman i became bold haughty intrepid with confidence more firm as it was simple resided my soul rather than my manner contempt with which my profound meditations had inspired me for manners maxims prejudices age which i lived rendered me proof against raillery those by whom they were possessed i crushed their little pleasantries with sentence as i would have crushed insect with my fingers what change all paris repeated severe acute sarcasms same man who two years before ten years afterwards knew not how find what he had say nor word he ought employ let situation world most contrary my natural disposition be sought after this will be found let one short moments my life which i became another man ceased be myself be recollected this also will be found time which i speak but instead continuing only six days or six weeks it lasted almost six years would perhaps still continue but for particular circumstances which caused it cease restored me nature above which i had wished soar beginning this change took place as soon as i had quitted paris sight vices that city no longer kept up indignation with which it had inspired me i no sooner had lost sight men than i ceased despise them once removed from those who designed me evil my hatred against them no longer existed my heart little fitted for hatred pitied their misery even their wickedness this situation more pleasing but less sublime soon allayed ardent enthusiasm by which i had so long been transported i insensibly almost myself even again became fearful complaisant timid word same jean jacques i before had been had this resolution gone no further than restoring me myself all would have been well but unfortunately it rapidly carried me away other extreme from that moment my mind agitation passed line repose its oscillations continually renewed have never permitted it remain here i must enter into some detail this second revolution terrible fatal era fate unparalleled amongst mortals we were but three persons our retirement it was therefore natural our intimacy should be increased by leisure solitude this was case between theresa myself we passed conversations shade most charming delightful hours more so than any i had hitherto enjoyed she seemed taste this sweet intercourse more than i had until then observed her do she opened her heart communicated me relative her mother family things she had had resolution enough conceal for great length time both had received from madam dupin numerous presents made them on my account mostly for me but which cunning old woman prevent my being angry had appropriated her own use that her other children without suffering theresa have least share strongly forbidding her say word me matter order poor girl had obeyed with incredible exactness but another thing which surprised me more than this had done was discovery that besides private conversations diderot grimm had frequently had with both endeavor detach them from me which by means resistance theresa they had not been able succeed they had afterwards had frequent conferences with mother subject which was secret daughter however she knew little presents had been made that there were mysterious goings backward forward motive which was entirely unknown her when we left paris madam le vasseur had long been habit going see grimm twice or thrice month continuing with him for hours together conversation so secret that servant was always sent out room i judged this motive be same nature with project into which they had attempted make daughter enter by promising procure her her mother by means madam d epinay salt huckster s license or snuff shop word by tempting her with allurements gain they had been told that as i was not situation do anything for them i could not on their account do anything for myself as all this i saw nothing but good intentions i was not absolutely displeased with them for it mystery was only thing which gave me pain especially on part old woman who moreover daily became more parasitical flattering towards me this however did not prevent her from reproaching her daughter private with telling me everything loving me too much observing her she was fool would at length be made dupe this woman possessed supreme degree art multiplying presents made her by concealing from one what she received from another from me what she received from all i could have pardoned her avarice but it was impossible i should forgive her dissimulation what could she have conceal from me whose happiness she knew principally consisted that herself her daughter what i had done for daughter i had done for myself but services i rendered mother merited on her part some acknowledgment she ought at least have thought herself obliged for them her daughter have loved me for sake her by whom i was already beloved i had raised her from lowest state wretchedness she received from my hands means subsistence was indebted me for her acquaintance with persons from whom she found means reap considerable benefit theresa had long supported her by her industry now maintained her with my bread she owed everything this daughter for whom she had done nothing her other children whom she had given marriage portions on whose account she had ruined herself far from giving her least aid devoured her substance mine i thought that such situation she ought consider me as her only friend most sure protector that far from making my own affairs secret me conspiring against me my house it was her duty faithfully acquaint me with everything which i was interested when this came her knowledge before it did mine what light therefore could i consider her false mysterious conduct what could i think sentiments with which she endeavored inspire her daughter what monstrous ingratitude was hers endeavor instil it into her from whom i expected my greatest consolation these reflections at length alienated my affections from this woman such degree that i could no longer look upon her but with contempt i nevertheless continued treat with respect mother friend my bosom everything show her almost reverence son but i must confess i could not remain long with her without pain that i never knew how bear restraint this is another short moment my life which i approached near happiness without being able attain it this by no fault my own had mother been good disposition we all three should have been happy end our days longest liver only would have been be pitied instead which reader will see course things took judge whether or not it was my power change it madam le vasseur who perceived i had got more full possession heart theresa that she had lost ground with her endeavored regain it instead striving restore herself my good opinion by mediation her daughter attempted alienate her affections from me one means she employed was call her family her aid i had begged theresa not invite any her relations hermitage she had promised me she would not these were sent for my absence without consulting her she was afterwards prevailed upon promise not say anything matter after first step was taken all rest were easy when once we make secret anything person we love we soon make little scruple doing it everything moment i was at chevrette hermitage was full people who sufficiently amused themselves mother has always great power over daughter mild disposition yet notwithstanding all old woman could do she was never able prevail upon theresa enter into her views nor persuade her join league against me for her part she resolved upon doing it forever seeing on one side her daughter myself who were situation live that was all on other diderot grimm d holbach madam d epinay who promised great things gave some little ones she could not conceive it was possible be wrong with wife farmer general baron had i been more clear sighted i should from this moment have perceived i nourished serpent my bosom but my blind confidence which nothing had yet diminished was such that i could not imagine she wished injure person she ought love though i saw numerous conspiracies formed on every side all i complain was tyranny persons who called themselves my friends who as it seemed would force me be happy manner they should point out not that i had chosen for myself although theresa refused join confederacy with her mother she afterwards kept her secret for this her motive was commendable although i will not determine whether she did it well or ill two women who have secrets between them love prattle together this attracted them towards each other theresa by dividing herself sometimes let me feel i was alone for i could no longer consider as society that which we all three formed i now felt neglect i had been guilty during first years our connection not taking advantage docility with which her love inspired her improve her talents give her knowledge which by more closely connecting us our retirement would agreeably have filled up her time my own without once suffering us perceive length private conversation not that this was ever exhausted between us or that she seemed disgusted with our walks but we had not sufficient number ideas common both make ourselves great store we could not incessantly talk our future projects which were confined those enjoying pleasures life objects around us inspired me with reflections beyond reach her comprehension attachment twelve years standing had no longer need words we were too well acquainted with each other have any new knowledge acquire that respect resource puns jests gossiping scandal was all that remained solitude especially is it that advantage living with person who knows how think is particularly felt i wanted not this resource amuse myself with her but she would have stood need it have always found amusement with me worst all was our being obliged hold our conversations when we could her mother who become importunate obliged me watch for opportunities do it i was under constraint my own house this is saying everything air love was prejudicial good friendship we had intimate intercourse without living intimacy moment i thought i perceived that theresa sometimes sought for pretext elude walks i proposed her i ceased invite her accompany me without being displeased with her for not finding them so much amusement as i did pleasure is not thing which depends upon will i was sure her heart possession this was all i desired as long as my pleasures were hers i tasted them with her when this ceased be case i preferred her contentment my own this manner it was that half deceived my expectation leading life after my own heart residence i had chosen with person who was dear me i at length found myself almost alone what i still wanted prevented me from enjoying what i had with respect happiness enjoyment everything or nothing was what was necessary me reason these observations will hereafter appear at present i return thread my narrative i imagined that i possessed treasures manuscripts given me by comte de st pierre on examination i found they were little more than collection printed works his uncle with notes corrections by his own hand few other trifling fragments which had not yet been published i confirmed myself by these moral writings idea i had conceived from some his letters shown me by madam de crequi that he had more sense ingenuity than at first i had imagined but after careful examination his political works i discerned nothing but superficial notions projects that were useful but impracticable consequence idea from which author never could depart that men conducted themselves by their sagacity rather than by their passions high opinion he had knowledge moderns had made him adopt this false principle improved reason basis all institutions he proposed source his political sophisms this extraordinary man honor age which he lived human species perhaps only person since creation mankind whose sole passion was that reason wandered all his systems from error error by attempting make men like himself instead taking them as they were are will continue be he labored for imaginary beings while he thought himself employed for benefit his contemporaries all these things considered i was rather embarrassed as form i should give my work suffer author s visions pass was doing nothing useful fully refute them would have been unpolite as care revising publishing his manuscripts which i had accepted even requested had been intrusted me this trust had imposed on me obligation treating author honorably i at length concluded upon that which me appeared most decent judicious useful this was give separately my own ideas those author for this purpose enter into his views set them new light amplify extend them spare nothing which might contribute present them all their excellence my work therefore was be composed two parts absolutely distinct one explain manner i have just mentioned different projects author other which was not appear until first had had its effect i should have given my opinion upon these projects which i confess might sometimes have exposed them fate sonnet misanthrope at head whole was have been life author for this i had collected some good materials which i flattered myself i should not spoil making use them i had been little acquainted with abbe de st pierre his old age veneration i had for his memory warranted me upon whole that comte would not be dissatisfied with manner which i should have treated his relation i made my first essay on perpetual peace greatest most elaborate all works which composed collection before i abandoned myself my reflections i had courage read everything abbe had written upon this fine subject without once suffering myself be disgusted either by his slowness or his repetitions public has seen extract on which account i have nothing say upon subject my opinion it has not been printed nor do i know that it ever will be however it was written at same time extract was made from this i passed polysynodie or plurality councils work written under regent favor administration he had chosen which caused abbe de saint pierre be expelled from academy on account some remarks unfavorable preceding administration with which duchess maine cardinal de polignac were displeased i completed this work as i did former with extract remarks but i stopped here without intending continue undertaking which i ought never have begun reflection which induced me give it up naturally presents itself it was astonishing i had not made it sooner most writings abbe de saint pierre were either observations or contained observations on some parts government france several these were so free nature that it was happy for him he had made them with impunity but offices all ministers state abbe de st pierre had ever been considered as kind preacher rather than real politician he was suffered say what he pleased because it appeared that nobody listened him had i procured him readers case would have been different he was frenchman i was not one by repeating his censures although his own name i exposed myself be asked rather rudely but without injustice what it was with which i meddled happily before i proceeded any further i perceived hold i was about give government against me i immediately withdrew i knew that living alone midst men more powerful than myself i never could by any means whatever be sheltered from injury they chose do me there was but one thing which depended upon my own efforts this was observe such line conduct that whenever they chose make me feel weight authority they could not do it without being unjust maxim which induced me decline proceeding with works abbe de saint pierre has frequently made me give up projects i had much more at heart people who are always ready construe adversity into crime would be much surprised were they know pains i have taken that during my misfortunes it might never with truth be said me thou hast deserved them after having given up manuscript i remained some time without determining upon work which should succeed it this interval inactivity was destructive by permitting me turn my reflections on myself for want another object engage my attention i had no project for future which could amuse my imagination it was not even possible form any as my situation was precisely that which all my desires were united i had not another conceive yet there was void my heart this state was more cruel as i saw no other that was be preferred it i had fixed my most tender affections upon person who made me return her own i lived with her without constraint so speak at discretion notwithstanding this secret grief mind never quitted me for moment either when she was present or absent possessing theresa i still perceived she wanted something her happiness sole idea my not being everything her had such effect upon my mind that she was next nothing me i had friends both sexes whom i was attached by purest friendship most perfect esteem i depended upon real return on their part doubt their sincerity never entered my mind yet this friendship was more tormenting than agreeable me by their obstinate perseverance even by their affectation opposing my taste inclinations manner living this such degree that moment i seemed desire thing which interested myself only depended not upon them they immediately joined their efforts oblige me renounce it this continued desire control me all my wishes more unjust as i did not so much as make myself acquainted with theirs became so cruelly oppressive that i never received one their letters without feeling certain terror as i opened it which was but too well justified by contents i thought being treated like child by persons younger than myself who themselves stood great need advice they so prodigally bestowed on me was too much love me said i them as i love you but every other respect let my affairs be as indifferent you as yours are me this is all i ask if they granted me one these two requests it was not latter i had retired residence charming solitude was master my own house could live it manner i thought proper without being controlled by any person this habitation imposed on me duties agreeable discharge but which were indispensable my liberty was precarious greater state subjection than person at command another it was my duty be so by inclination when i arose morning i never could say myself i will employ this day as i think proper moreover besides my being subject obey call madam d epinay i was exposed still more disagreeable importunities public chance comers distance i was at from paris did not prevent crowds idlers not knowing how spend their time from daily breaking upon me without least scruple freely disposing mine when i least expected visitors i was unmercifully assailed by them i seldom made plan for agreeable employment day that was not counteracted by arrival some stranger short finding no real enjoyment midst pleasures i had been most desirous obtain i by sudden mental transitions returned imagination serene days my youth sometimes exclaimed with sigh ah this is not les charmettes recollection different periods my life led me reflect upon that at which i was arrived i found i was already on decline prey painful disorders imagined i was approaching end my days without having tasted all its plentitude scarcely any one pleasures after which my heart had so much thirsted or having given scope lively sentiments i felt it had reserve i had not favored even that intoxicating voluptuousness with which my mind was richly stored which for want object was always compressed never exhaled but by signs how was it possible that with mind naturally expansive i with whom live was love should not hitherto have found friend entirely devoted me real friend i who felt myself so capable being such friend another how can it be accounted for that with such warm affections such combustible senses heart wholly made up love i had not once at least felt its flame for determinate object tormented by want loving without ever having been able satisfy it i perceived myself approaching eve old age hastening on death without having lived these melancholy but affecting recollections led me others which although accompanied with regret were not wholly unsatisfactory i thought something i had not yet received was still due me from destiny what end was i born with exquisite faculties suffer them remain unemployed sentiment conscious merit which made me consider myself as suffering injustice was some kind reparation caused me shed tears which with pleasure i suffered flow these were my mediations during finest season year month june cool shades songs nightingale warbling brooks everything concurred plunging me into that too seducing state indolence for which i was born from which my austere manner proceeding from long effervescence should forever have delivered me i unfortunately remembered dinner chateau de toune my meeting with two charming girls same season places much resembling that which i then was remembrance these circumstances which innocence that accompanied them rendered me still more dear brought several others nature my recollection i presently saw myself surrounded by all objects which my youth had given me emotion mademoiselle galley mademoiselle de graffenried mademoiselle de breil madam basile madam de larnage my pretty scholars even bewitching zulietta whom my heart could not forget i found myself midst seraglio houris my old acquaintance for whom most lively inclination was not new me my blood became inflamed my head turned notwithstanding my hair was almost gray grave citizen geneva austere jean jacques at forty five years age again became fond shepherd intoxication with which my mind was seized although sudden extravagant was so strong lasting that enable me recover from it nothing less than unforeseen terrible crisis it brought on was necessary this intoxication whatever degree it was carried went not so far as make me forget my age situation flatter me that i could still inspire love nor make me attempt communicate devouring flame by which ever since my youth i had felt my heart vain consumed for this i did not hope i did not even desire it i knew season love was past i knew too well what contempt ridiculous pretensions superannuated gallants were held ever add one number i was not man become impudent coxcomb decline life after having been so little such during flower my age besides as friend peace i should have been apprehensive domestic dissensions i too sincerely loved theresa expose her mortification seeing me entertain for others more lively sentiments than those with which she inspired me for herself what step did i take upon this occasion my reader will already have guessed it if he has taken trouble pay least attention my narrative impossibility attaining real beings threw me into regions chimera seeing nothing existence worthy my delirium i sought food for it ideal world which my imagination quickly peopled with beings after my own heart this resource never came more apropos nor was it ever so fertile my continual ecstasy i intoxicated my mind with most delicious sentiments that ever entered heart man entirely forgetting human species i formed myself societies perfect beings whose virtues were as celestial as their beauty tender faithful friends such as i never found here below i became so fond soaring empyrean midst charming objects with which i was surrounded that i thus passed hours days without perceiving it losing remembrance all other things i scarcely had eaten morsel haste before i was impatient make my escape run regain my groves when ready depart for enchanted world i saw arrive wretched mortals who came detain me upon earth i could neither conceal nor moderate my vexation no longer master myself i gave them so uncivil reception that it might justly be termed brutal this tended confirm my reputation as misanthrope from very cause which could world have read my heart should have acquired me one nature directly opposite midst my exultation i was pulled down like paper kite restored my proper place by means smart attack my disorder i recurred only means that had before given me relief thus made truce with my angelic amours for besides that it seldom happens that man is amorous when he suffers my imagination which is animated country beneath shade trees languishes becomes extinguished chamber under joists ceiling i frequently regretted that there existed no dryads it would certainly have been amongst these that i should have fixed my attachment other domestic broils came at same time increase my chagrin madam le vasseur while making me finest compliments world alienated from me her daughter as much as she possibly could i received letters from my late neighborhood informing me that good old lady had secretly contracted several debts name theresa whom these became known but which she had never mentioned me word debts be paid hurt me much less than secret that had been made them how could she for whom i had never had secret have one from me is it possible dissimulate with persons whom we love coterie holbachique who found i never made journey paris began seriously be afraid i was happy satisfied country madman enough reside there hence cabals by which attempts were made recall me indirectly city diderot who did not immediately wish show himself began by detaching from me de leyre whom i had brought acquainted with him who received transmitted me impressions diderot chose give without suspecting what end they were directed everything seemed concur withdrawing me from my charming mad reverie i was not recovered from late attack i had when i received copy poem on destruction lisbon which i imagined be sent by author this made it necessary i should write him speak his composition i did so my letter was long time afterwards printed without my consent as i shall hereafter have occasion remark struck by seeing this poor man overwhelmed if i may so speak with prosperity honor bitterly exclaiming against miseries this life finding everything be wrong i formed mad project making him turn his attention himself proving him that everything was right voltaire while he appeared believe god never really believed anything but devil since his pretended deity is malicious being who according him had no pleasure but evil glaring absurdity this doctrine is particularly disgusting from man enjoying greatest prosperity who from bosom happiness endeavors by frightful cruel image all calamities from which he is exempt reduce his fellow creatures despair i who had better right than he calculate weigh all evils human life impartially examined them proved him that all possible evils there was not one be attributed providence which had not its source rather abusive use man made his faculties than nature i treated him this letter with greatest respect delicacy possible yet knowing his self love be extremely irritable i did not send letter immediately himself but doctor tronchin his physician friend with full power either give it him or destroy it voltaire informed me few lines that being ill having likewise care sick person he postponed his answer until some future day said not word on subject tronchin when he sent me letter inclosed it another which he expressed but very little esteem for person from whom he received it i have never published nor even shown either these two letters not liking make parade such little triumphs but originals are my collections since that time voltaire has published answer he promised me but which i never received this is novel candide which i cannot speak because i have not read it all these interruptions ought have cured me my fantastic amours they were perhaps means offered me by heaven prevent their destructive consequences but my evil genius prevailed i had scarcely begun go out before my heart my head my feet returned same paths i say same certain respects for my ideas rather less exalted remained this time upon earth but yet were busied making so exquisite choice all that was be found there amiable every kind that it was not much less chimerical than imaginary world i had abandoned i figured myself love friendship two idols my heart under most ravishing images i amused myself adorning them with all charms sex i had always adored i imagined two female friends rather than two my own sex because although example be more rare it is also more amiable i endowed them with different characters but analogous their connection with two faces not perfectly beautiful but according my taste animated with benevolence sensibility i made one brown other fair one lively other languishing one wise other weak but so amiable weakness that it seemed add charm virtue i gave one two lover whom other was tender friend even something more but i did not admit either rivalry quarrels or jealousy because every painful sentiment is painful for me imagine i was unwilling tarnish this delightful picture by anything which was degrading nature smitten with my two charming models i drew my own portrait lover friend as much as it was possible do it but i made him young amiable giving him at same time virtues defects which i felt myself that i might place my characters residence proper for them i successively passed review most beautiful places i had seen my travels but i found no grove sufficiently delightful no landscape that pleased me valleys thessaly would have satisfied me had i but once had sight them but my imagination fatigued with invention wished for some real place which might serve it as point rest upon create me illusion with respect real existence inhabitants i intended place there i thought good while upon borromean islands delightful prospect which had transported me but i found them too much art ornament for my lovers i however wanted lake i concluded by making choice that about which my heart has never ceased wander i fixed myself upon that part banks this lake where my wishes have long since placed my residence imaginary happiness which fate has confined me native place my poor mamma had still for me charm contrast situations richness variety sites magnificence majesty whole which ravishes senses affects heart elevates mind determined me give it preference i placed my young pupils at vervey this is what i imagined at first sketch rest was not added until afterwards i for long time confined myself this vague plan because it was sufficient fill my imagination with agreeable objects my heart with sentiments which it delighted these fictions by frequently presenting themselves at length gained consistence took my mind determined form i then had inclination express upon paper some situations fancy presented me recollecting everything i had felt during my youth thus some measure gave object that desire loving which i had never been able satisfy by which i felt myself consumed i first wrote few incoherent letters when i afterwards wished give them connection i frequently found difficulty doing it what is scarcely credible although most strictly true is my having written first two parts almost wholly this manner without having any plan formed not foreseeing i should one day be tempted make it regular work for this reason two parts afterwards formed materials not prepared for place which they are disposed are full unmeaning expressions not found others midst my reveries i had visit from madam d houdetot first she had ever made me but which unfortunately was not last as will hereafter appear comtesse d houdetot was daughter late m de bellegarde farmer general sister m d epinay messieurs de lalive de la briche both whom have since been introductors ambassadors i have spoken acquaintance i made with her before she was married since that event i had not seen her except at fetes at la chevrette with madam d epinay her sister law having frequently passed several days with her both at la chevrette epinay i always thought her amiable that she seemed be my well wisher she was fond walking with me we were both good walkers conversation between us was inexhaustible however i never went see her paris although she had several times requested solicited me do it her connections with m de st lambert with whom i began be intimate rendered her more interesting me it was bring me some account that friend who was i believe then at mahon that she came see me at hermitage this visit had something appearance beginning romance she lost her way her coachman quitting road which turned right attempted cross straight over from mill clairvaux hermitage her carriage stuck quagmire bottom valley she got out walked rest road her delicate shoes were soon worn through she sunk into dirt her servants had greatest difficulty extricating her she at length arrived at hermitage boots making place resound with her laughter which i most heartily joined she had change everything theresa provided her with what was necessary i prevailed upon her forget her dignity partake rustic collation with which she seemed highly satisfied it was late her stay was short but interview was so mirthful that it pleased her she seemed disposed return she did not however put this project into execution until next year but alas delay was not favorable me anything i passed autumn employment no person would suspect me undertaking this was guarding fruit m d epinay hermitage was reservoir waters park chevrette there was garden walled round planted with espaliers other trees which produced m d epinay more fruit than his kitchen garden at chevrette although three fourths it were stolen from him that i might not be guest entirely useless i took upon myself direction garden inspection conduct gardener everything went on well until fruit season but as this became ripe i observed that it disappeared without knowing what manner it was disposed gardener assured me it was dormice which eat it all i destroyed great number these animals notwithstanding which fruit still diminished i watched gardener s motions so narrowly that i found he was great dormouse he lodged at montmorency whence he came night with his wife children take away fruit he had concealed daytime which he sold market at paris as publicly as if he had brought it from garden his own wretch whom i loaded with kindness whose children were clothed by theresa whose father who was beggar i almost supported robbed us with as much ease as effrontery not one three being sufficiently vigilant prevent him one night he emptied my cellar whilst he seemed address himself me only i suffered everything but being desirous giving account fruit i was obliged declare by whom great part it had been stolen madam d epinay desired me pay discharge him look out for another i did so as this rascal rambled about hermitage night armed with thick club staff with iron ferrule accompanied by other villains like himself relieve governesses from their fears i made his successor sleep house with us this not being sufficient remove their apprehensions i sent ask m d epinay for musket which i kept chamber gardener with charge not make use it except attempt was made break open door or scale walls garden fire nothing but powder meaning only frighten thieves this was certainly least precaution man indisposed could take for common safety himself family having pass winter midst wood with two timid women i also procured little dog serve as sentinel de leyre coming see me about this time i related him my situation we laughed together at my military apparatus at his return paris he wished amuse diderot with story by this means coterie d holbachique learned that i was seriously resolved pass winter at hermitage this perseverance which they had not imagined me be capable disconcerted them until they could think some other means making my residence disagreeable me they sent back by means diderot same de leyre who though at first he had thought my precautions quite natural now pretended discover that they were inconsistent with my principles styled them more than ridiculous his letters which he overwhelmed me with pleasantries sufficiently bitter satirical offend me had i been least disposed take offence but at that time being full tender affectionate sentiments not susceptible any other i perceived his biting sarcasms nothing more than jest believed him only jocose when others would have thought him mad by my care vigilance i guarded garden so well that although there had been but little fruit that year produce was triple that preceding years it is true i spared no pains preserve it i went so far as escort what i sent chevrette epinay carry baskets it myself aunt i carried one these which was so heavy that we were obliged rest at every dozen steps which we arrived with it we were quite wet with perspiration as soon as bad season began confine me house i wished return my indolent amusements but this i found impossible i had everywhere two charming female friends before my eyes their friend everything by which they were surrounded country they inhabited objects created or embellished for them by my imagination i was no longer myself for moment my delirium never left me after many useless efforts banish all fictions from my mind they at length seduced me my future endeavors were confined giving them order coherence for purpose converting them into species novel what embarrassed me most was that i had contradicted myself so openly fully after severe principles i had just so publicly asserted after austere maxims i had so loudly preached my violent invectives against books which breathed nothing but effeminacy love could anything be less expected or more extraordinary than see me with my own hand write my name list authors those books i had so severely censured i felt this incoherence all its extent i reproached myself with it i blushed at it was vexed but all this could not bring me back reason completely overcome i was at all risks obliged submit resolve brave whatever world might say it except only deliberating afterwards whether or not i should show my work for i did not yet suppose i should ever determine publish it this resolution taken i entirely abandoned myself my reveries by frequently resolving these my mind formed with them kind plan which execution has been seen this was certainly greatest advantage that could be drawn from my follies love good which has never once been effaced from my heart turned them towards useful objects moral which might have produced its good effects my voluptuous descriptions would have lost all their graces had they been devoid coloring innocence weak girl is object pity whom love may

never had such real proofs her friendship for me which mine never more fully answered it would be wrong me were not i among these proofs make special mention her portrait which she sent me at same

found little under petticoat english flannel which she told me she had worn desired i would make it under waistcoat this care more than friendly appeared me so tender as if she had stripped herself clothe me that my emotion i repeatedly kissed shedding tears at same time both note petticoat theresa thought me mad it is singular that all marks friendship madam d epinay ever showed me this touched me most that ever since our rupture i have never recollected it without being very sensibly affected i for long time preserved her little note it would still have been my possession had not it shared fate my other notes received at same period although my disorder then gave me but little respite winter part interval was employed seeking relief from pain this was still upon whole season which since my residence france i had passed with most pleasure tranquillity during four or five months whilst bad weather sheltered me from interruptions importunate visits i tasted greater degree than i had ever yet or have since done that equal simple independent life enjoyment which still made it more desirable me without any other company than two governesses reality two female cousins idea it was then especially that i daily congratulated myself upon resolution i had had good sense take unmindful clamors my friends who were vexed at seeing me delivered from their tyranny when i heard attempt madman when de leyre madam d epinay spoke me letters trouble agitation which reigned paris how thankful was i heaven for having placed me at distance from all such spectacles horror guilt these would have been continued increased bilious humor which sight public disorders had given me whilst seeing nothing around me my retirement but gay pleasing objects my heart was wholly abandoned sentiments which were amiable i remark here with pleasure course last peaceful moments that were left me spring succeeding this winter which had been so calm developed germ misfortunes i have yet describe tissue which like interval wherein i had leisure respite will not be found i think however i recollect that during this interval peace bosom my solitude i was not quite undisturbed by holbachiens diderot stirred me up some strife i am much deceived if it was not course this winter that fils naturel natural son which i shall soon have occasion speak made its appearance independently causes which left me but few papers relative that period those even which i have been able preserve are not very exact with respect dates diderot never dated his letters madam d epinay madam d houdetot seldom dated theirs except day week de leyre mostly confined himself same rules when i was desirous putting these letters order i was obliged supply what was wanting by guessing at dates so uncertain that i cannot depend upon them unable therefore fix with certainty beginning these quarrels i prefer relating one subsequent article everything i can recollect concerning them return spring had increased my amorous delirium my melancholy occasioned by excess my transports i had composed for last parts eloisa several letters wherein evident marks rapture which i wrote them are found amongst others i may quote those from elysium excursion upon lake which if my memory does not deceive me are at end fourth part whoever reading these letters does not feel his heart soften melt into tenderness by which they were dictated ought lay down book nature has refused him means judging sentiment precisely at same time i received second unforeseen visit from madam d houdetot absence her husband who was captain gendarmarie her lover who was also service she had come eaubonne middle valley montmorency where she had taken pretty house from thence she made new excursion hermitage she came on horseback dressed men s clothes although i am not very fond this kind masquerade i was struck with romantic appearance she made for once it was with love as this was first only time all my life consequence which will forever render it terrible my remembrance i must take permission enter into some particulars on subject countess d houdetot was nearly thirty years age not handsome her face was marked with smallpox her complexion coarse she was short sighted her eyes were rather round but she had fine long black hair which hung down natural curls below her waist her figure was agreeable she was at once both awkward graceful her motions her wit was natural pleasing this gayety heedlessness ingenuousness were perfectly suited she abounded charming sallies after which she so little sought that they sometimes escaped her lips spite herself she possessed several agreeable talents played harpsichord danced well wrote pleasing poetry her character was angelic this was founded upon sweetness mind except prudence fortitude contained it every virtue she was besides so much be depended upon all intercourse so faithful society even her enemies were not under necessity concealing from her their secrets i mean by her enemies men or rather women by whom she was not beloved for as herself she had not heart capable hatred i am opinion this conformity with mine greatly contributed towards inspiring me with passion for her confidence most intimate friendship i never heard her speak ill persons who were absent not even her sister law she could neither conceal her thoughts from anyone nor disguise any her sentiments i am persuaded she spoke her lover her husband as she spoke him her friends acquaintances everybody without distinction persons what proved beyond all manner doubt purity sincerity her nature was that subject very extraordinary absences mind most laughable inconsiderateness she was often guilty some very imprudent ones with respect herself but never least offensive any person whatsoever she had been married very young against her inclinations comte d houdetot man fashion good officer but man who loved play chicane who was not very amiable whom she never loved she found m de saint lambert all merit her husband with more agreeable qualities mind joined with virtue talents if anything manners age can be pardoned it is attachment which duration renders more pure which its effects do honor which becomes cemented by reciprocal esteem it was little from inclination as i am disposed think but much more please saint lambert that she came see me he had requested her do it there was reason believe friendship which began be established between us would render this society agreeable all three she knew i was acquainted with their connection as she could speak me without restraint it was natural she should find my conversation agreeable she came i saw her i was intoxicated with love without object this intoxication fascinated my eyes object fixed itself upon her i saw my julia madam d houdetot i soon saw nothing but madam d houdetot but with all perfections with which i had just adorned idol my heart complete my delirium she spoke me saint lambert with fondness passionate lover contagious force love while listening her finding myself near her i was seized with delicious trembling which i had never before experienced when near any person whatsoever she spoke i felt myself affected i thought i was nothing more than interested her sentiments when i perceived i possessed those which were similar i drank freely poisoned cup which i yet tasted nothing more than sweetness finally imperceptibly us both she inspired me for herself with all she expressed for her lover alas it was very late life cruel was it consume with passion not less violent than unfortunate for woman whose heart was already possession another notwithstanding extraordinary emotions i had felt when near her i did not at first perceive what had happened me it was not until after her departure that wishing think julia i was struck with surprise at being unable think anything but madam d houdetot then was it my eyes were opened i felt my misfortune lamented what had happened but i did not foresee consequences i hesitated long time on manner which i should conduct myself towards her as if real love left behind it sufficient reason deliberate act accordingly i had not yet determined upon this when she unexpectedly returned found me unprovided it was this time perfectly acquainted with my situation shame companion evil rendered me dumb made me tremble her presence i neither dared open my mouth or raise my eyes i was inexpressible confusion which it was impossible she should not perceive i resolved confess her my troubled state mind left her guess cause whence it proceeded this was telling her terms sufficiently clear had i been young amiable madam d houdetot afterwards weak i should here blame her conduct but this was not case i am obliged applaud admire it resolution she took was equally prudent generous she could not suddenly break with me without giving her reasons for it saint lambert who himself had desired her come see me this would have exposed two friends rupture perhaps public one which she wished avoid she had for me esteem good wishes she pitied my folly without encouraging it endeavored restore me reason she was glad preserve her lover herself friend for whom she had some respect she spoke nothing with more pleasure than intimate agreeable society we might form between us three moment i should become reasonable she did not always confine herself these friendly exhortations case need did not spare me more severe reproaches which i had richly deserved i spared myself still less moment i was alone i began recover i was more calm after my declaration love known person by whom it is inspired becomes more supportable forcible manner which i approached myself with mine ought have cured me it had thing been possible what powerful motives did i not call my mind stifle it my morals sentiments principles shame treachery crime abusing what was confided friendship ridiculousness burning at my age with most extravagant passion for object whose heart was preengaged who could neither make me return nor least hope moreover with passion which far from having anything gain by constancy daily became less sufferable we would imagine that last consideration which ought have added weight all others was that whereby i eluded them what scruple thought i ought i make folly prejudicial nobody but myself am i then young man whom madam d houdetot ought be afraid would not it be said by my presumptive remorse that by my gallantry manner dress i was going seduce her poor jean jacques love on at thy ease all safety conscience be not afraid that thy sighs will be prejudicial saint lambert it has been seen that i never was coxcomb not even my youth manner thinking which i have spoken was according my turn mind it flattered my passion this was sufficient induce me abandon myself it without reserve laugh even at impertinent scruple i thought i had made from vanity rather than from reason this is great lesson for virtuous minds which vice never attacks openly it finds means surprise them by masking itself with sophisms not unfrequently with virtue guilty without remorse i soon became so without measure i entreat it may be observed what manner my passion followed my nature at length plunge me into abyss first place it assumed air humility encourage me render me intrepid it carried this humility even mistrust madam d houdetot incessantly putting mind my duty without once for single moment flattering my folly treated me with greatest mildness remained with me upon footing most tender friendship this friendship would i protest have satisfied my wishes had i thought it sincere but finding it too strong be real i took it into my head that love so ill suited my age appearance had rendered me contemptible eyes madam d houdetot that this young mad creature only wished divert herself with me my superannuated passion that she had communicated this saint lambert that indignation caused by my breach friendship having made her lover enter into her views they were agreed turn my head then laugh at me this folly which at twenty six years age had made me guilty some extravagant behavior madam de larnage whom i did not know would have been pardonable me at forty five with madam d houdetot had not i known that she her lover were persons too much uprightness indulge themselves such barbarous amusement madam d houdetot continued her visits which i delayed not return she as well as myself was fond walking we took long walks enchanting country satisfied with loving daring say i loved i should have been most agreeable situation had not my extravagance spoiled all charm it she at first could not comprehend foolish pettishness with which i received her attentions but my heart incapable concealing what passed it did not long leave her ignorant my suspicions she endeavored laugh at them but this expedient did not succeed transports rage would have been consequence she changed her tone her compassionate gentleness was invincible she made me reproaches which penetrated my heart she expressed inquietude at my unjust fears which i took advantage i required proofs her being earnest she perceived there was no other means relieving me from my apprehensions i became pressing step was delicate it is astonishing perhaps without example that woman having suffered herself be brought hesitate should have got herself off so well she refused me nothing most tender friendship could grant yet she granted me nothing that rendered her unfaithful i had mortification see that disorder into which most trifling favors had thrown all my senses had not least effect upon hers i have somewhere said that nothing should be granted senses when we wished refuse them anything prove how false this maxim was relative madam d houdetot how far she was right depend upon her own strength mind it would be necessary enter into detail our long frequent conversations follow them all their liveliness during four months we passed together intimacy almost without example between two friends different sexes who contain themselves within bounds which we never exceeded ah if i had lived so long without feeling power real love my heart senses abundantly paid arrears what therefore are transports we feel with object our affections by whom we are beloved since passions which my idol did not partake inspired such as i felt but i am wrong saying madam houdetot did not partake passion love that which i felt was some measure confined myself yet love was equal on both sides but not reciprocal we were both intoxicated with passion she for her lover i for herself our sighs delicious tears were mingled together tender confidants secrets each other there was so great similarity our sentiments that it was impossible they should not find some common point union midst this delicious intoxication she never forgot herself for moment i solemnly protest that if ever led away by my senses i have attempted render her unfaithful i was never really desirous succeeding vehemence itself my passion restrained it within bounds duty self denial had elevated my mind lustre every virture adorned my eyes idol my heart have soiled their divine image would have been destroy it i might have committed crime it has been hundred times committed my heart but dishonor my sophia ah was this ever possible no i have told her hundred times it was not had i had it my power satisfy my desires had she consented commit herself my discretion i should except few moments delirium have refused be happy at price her honor i loved her too well wish possess her distance from hermitage raubonne is almost league my frequent excursions it i have sometimes slept there one evening after having supped tete tete we went walk garden by fine moonlight at bottom garden considerable copse through which we passed on our way pretty grove ornamented with cascade which i had given her idea she had procured it be executed accordingly eternal remembrance innocence enjoyment it was this grove that seated by her side upon seat turf under acacia full bloom i found for emotions my heart language worthy them it was first only time my life but i was sublime if everything amiable seducing with which most tender ardent love can inspire heart man can be so called what intoxicating tears did i shed upon her knees how many did i make her shed involuntarily at length involuntary transport she exclaimed no never was man so amiable nor ever was there one who loved like you but your friend saint lambert hears us my heart is incapable loving twice i exhausted myself with sighs i embraced her what embrace but this was all she had lived alone for last six months that is absent from her husband lover i had seen her almost every day during three months love seldom failed make third we had supped tete tete we were alone grove by moonlight after two hours most lively tender conversation she left this grove at midnight arms her lover as morally physically pure as she had entered it reader weigh all these circumstances i will add nothing more do not however imagine that this situation my passions left me as undisturbed as i was with theresa mamma i have already observed i was this time inspired not only with love but with love all its energy fury i will not describe either agitations tremblings palpitations convulsionary emotions nor faintings heart i continually experienced these may be judged by effect her image alone made upon me i have observed distance from hermitage eaubonne was considerable i went by hills andilly which are delightful i mused as i walked on her whom i was going see charming reception she would give me upon kiss which awaited me at my arrival this single kiss this pernicious embrace even before i received it inflamed my blood such degree as affect my head my eyes were dazzled my knees trembled were unable support me i was obliged stop sit down my whole frame was inconceivable disorder i was upon point fainting knowing danger i endeavored at setting out divert my attention from object think something else i had not proceeded twenty steps before same recollection all that was consequence it assailed me such manner that it was impossible avoid them spite all my efforts i do not believe i ever made this little excursion alone with impunity i arrived at eaubonne weak exhausted scarcely able support myself moment i saw her everything was repaired all i felt her presence was importunity inexhaustible useless ardor upon road raubonne there was pleasant terrace called mont olympe at which we sometimes met i arrived first it was proper i should wait for her but how dear this waiting cost me divert my attention i endeavored write with my pencil billets which i could have written with purest drops my blood i never could finish one which was eligible when she found note niche upon which we had agreed all she learned from contents was deplorable state which i was when i wrote it this state its continuation during three months irritation self denial so exhausted me that i was several years before i recovered from it at end these it left me ailment which i shall carry with me or which will carry me grave such was sole enjoyment man most combustible constitution but who was at same time perhaps one most timid mortals nature ever produced such were last happy days i can reckon upon earth at end these began long train evils which there will be found but little interruption it has been seen that during whole course my life my heart as transparent as crystal has never been capable concealing for space moment any sentiment least lively which had taken refuge it it will therefore be judged whether or not it was possible for me long conceal my affection for madam d houdetot our intimacy struck eyes everybody we did not make it either secret or mystery it was not nature require any such precaution as madam d houdetot had for me most tender friendship with which she did not reproach herself i for her esteem with justice which nobody was better acquainted than myself she frank absent heedless i true awkward haughty impatient choleric we exposed ourselves more deceitful security than we should have done had we been culpable we both went chevrette we sometimes met there by appointment we lived there according our accustomed manner walking together every day talking our amours our duties our friend our innocent projects all this park opposite apartment madam d epinay under her windows whence incessantly examining us thinking herself braved she by her eyes filled her heart with rage indignation women have art concealing their anger especially when it is great madam d epinay violent but deliberate possessed this art eminent degree she feigned not see or suspect anything at same time that she doubled towards me her cares attention allurements she affected load her sister law with incivilities marks disdain which she seemingly wished communicate me it will easily be imagined she did not succeed but i was on rack torn by opposite passions at same time that i was sensible her caresses i could scarcely contain my anger when i saw her wanting good manners madam d houdetot angelic sweetness this lady made her endure everything without complaint or even without being offended she was fact so absent always so little attentive these things that half time she did not perceive them i was so taken up with my passion that seeing nothing but sophia one names madam d houdetot i did not perceive that i was become laughing stock whole house all those who came it baron d holbach who never as i heard had been at chevrette was one latter had i at that time been as mistrustful as i am since become i should strongly have suspected madam d epinay have contrived this journey give baron amusing spectacle amorous citizen but i was then so stupid that i saw not that even which was glaring everybody my stupidity did not however prevent me from finding baron more jovial satisfied appearance than ordinary instead looking upon me with his usual moroseness he said me hundred jocose things without my knowing what he meant surprise was painted my countenance but i answered not word madam d epinay shook her sides with laughing i knew not what possessed them as nothing yet passed bounds pleasantry best thing i could have done had i been secret would have been have humored joke it is true i perceived amid rallying gayety baron that his eyes sparkled with malicious joy which could have given me pain had i then remarked it degree it has since occurred my recollection one day when i went see madam d houdetot at eaubonne after her return from one her journeys paris i found her melancholy observed that she had been weeping i was obliged put restraint on myself because madam de blainville sister her husband was present but moment i found opportunity i expressed her my uneasiness ah said she with sigh i am much afraid your follies will cost me repose rest my days st lambert has been informed what has passed ill informed it he does me justice but he is vexed what is still worse he conceals from me part his vexation fortunately i have not concealed from him anything relative our connection which was formed under his auspices my letters like my heart were full yourself i made him acquainted with everything except your extravagant passion which i hoped cure you which he imputes me as crime somebody has done us ill offices i have been injured but what does this signify either let us entirely break with each other or do you be what you ought be i will not future have anything conceal from my lover this was first moment which i was sensible shame feeling myself humbled by sentiment my fault presence young woman whose just reproaches i approved whom i ought have been mentor indignation i felt against myself would perhaps have been sufficient overcome my weakness had not tender passion inspired me by victim it again softened my heart alas was this moment harden it when it was overflowed by tears which penetrated it every part this tenderness was soon changed into rage against vile informers who had seen nothing but evil criminal but involuntary sentiment without believing or even imagining sincere uprightness heart by which it was counteracted we did not remain long doubt about hand by which blow was directed we both knew that madam d epinay corresponded with st lambert this was not first storm she had raised up against madam d houdetot from whom she had made thousand efforts detach her lover success some which made consequences be dreaded besides grimm who i think had accompanied m de castries army was westphalia as well as saint lambert they sometimes visited grimm had made some attempts on madam d houdetot which had not succeeded being extremely piqued suddenly discontinued his visits her let it be judged with what calmness modest as he is known be he supposed she preferred him man older than himself whom since he had frequented great he had never spoken but as person whom he patronized my suspicions madam d epinay were changed into certainty moment i heard what had passed my own house when i was at chevrette theresa frequently came there either bring me letters or pay me that attention which my ill state health rendered necessary madam d epinay had asked her if madam d houdetot i did not write each other upon her answering affirmative madam d epinay pressed her give her letters madam d houdetot assuring her that she would reseal them such manner as it should never be known theresa without showing how much she was shocked at proposition without even putting me upon my guard did nothing more than seal letters she brought me more carefully lucky precaution for madam d epinay had her watched when she arrived waiting for her passage several times carried her audaciousness as far as examine her tucker she did more even than this having one day invited herself with m de margency dinner at hermitage for first time since i resided there she seized moment i was walking with margency go into my closet with mother daughter press them show her letters madam d houdetot had mother known where letters were they would have been given her fortunately daughter was only person who was secret denied my having preserved any one them virtuous faithful generous falsehood whilst truth would have been perfidy madam d epinay perceiving theresa was not be seduced endeavored irritate her by jealousy reproaching her with her easy temper blindness how is it possible said she her you cannot perceive there is criminal intercourse between them if besides what strikes your eyes you stand need other proofs lend your assistance obtain that which may furnish them you say he tears letters from madam d houdetot as soon as he has read them well carefully gather up pieces give them me i will take upon myself put them together such were lessons my friend gave partner my bed theresa had discretion conceal from me for considerable time all these attempts but perceiving how much i was perplexed she thought herself obliged inform me everything end that knowing with whom i had do i might take my measures accordingly my rage indignation are not be described instead dissembling with madam d epinay according her own example making use counterplots i abandoned myself without reserve natural impetuosity my temper with my accustomed inconsiderateness came open rupture my imprudence will be judged by following letters which sufficiently show manner proceeding both parties on this occasion note from madam d epinay why my dear friend do i not see you you make me uneasy you have so often promised me do nothing but go come between this place hermitage this i have left you at liberty you have suffered week pass without coming had not i been told you were well i should have imagined contrary i expected you either day before yesterday or yesterday but found myself disappointed my god what is matter with you you have no business nor can you have any uneasiness for had this been case i flatter myself you would have come communicated it me you are therefore ill relieve me i beseech you speedily from my fears adieu my dear friend let this adieu produce me good morning from you answer i cannot yet say anything you i wait be better informed this i shall be sooner or later meantime be persuaded that innocence will find defender sufficiently powerful cause some repentance slanderers be they who they may second note from same do you know that your letter frightens me what does it mean i have read it twenty times truth i do not understand what it means all i can perceive is that you are uneasy tormented that you wait until you are no longer so before you speak me upon subject is this my dear friend what we agreed upon what then is become that friendship confidence by what means have i lost them is it with me or for me that you are angry however this may be come me this evening i conjure you remember you promised me no longer than week ago let nothing remain upon your mind but immediately communicate me whatever might make it uneasy my dear friend i live that confidence there i have just read your letter again i do not understand contents better but they make me tremble you seem be cruelly agitated i could wish calm your mind but as i am ignorant cause whence your uneasiness arises i know not what say except that i am as wretched as yourself shall remain so until we meet if you are not here this evening at six o clock i set off morrow for hermitage let weather be how it will whatever state health i may be for i can no longer support inquietude i now feel good day my dear friend at all risks i take liberty tell you without knowing whether or not you are need such advice endeavor stop progress uneasiness makes solitude fly becomes monster i have frequently experienced it answer i can neither come see you nor receive your visit so long as my present inquietude continues confidence which you speak no longer exists it will be easy for you recover it i see nothing more your present anxiety than desire drawing from confessions others some advantage agreeable your views my heart so ready pour its overflowings into another which opens itself receive them is shut against trick cunning i distinguish your ordinary address difficulty you find understanding my note do you think me dupe enough believe you have not comprehended what it meant no but i shall know how overcome your subtleties by my frankness i will explain myself more clearly that you may understand me still less two lovers closely united worthy each other s love are dear me i expect you will not know who i mean unless i name them i presume attempts have been made disunite them that i have been made use inspire one two with jealousy choice was not judicious but it appeared convenient purposes malice this malice it is you whom i suspect be guilty i hope this becomes more clear thus woman whom i most esteem would with my knowledge have been loaded with infamy dividing her heart person between two lovers i with that being one these wretches if i knew that for single moment your life you ever had thought this either her or myself i should hate you until my last hour but it is with having said not with having thought it that i charge you this case i cannot comprehend which three you wished injure but if you love peace mind tremble lest you should have succeeded i have not concealed either from you or her all ill i think certain connections but i wish these end by means as virtuous as their cause that illegitimate love may be changed into eternal friendship should i who never do ill any person be innocent means doing it my friends no i should never forgive you i should become your irreconcilable enemy your secrets are all i should respect for i will never be man without honor i do not apprehend my present perplexity will continue long time i shall soon know whether or not i am deceived i shall then perhaps have great injuries repair which i will do with as much cheerfulness as that with which most agreeable act my life has been accompanied but do you know what manner i will make amends for my faults during short space time i have remain near you by doing what nobody but myself would do by telling you freely what world thinks you breaches you have repair your reputation notwithstanding all pretended friends by whom you are surrounded moment you see me depart you may bid adieu truth you will no longer find any person who will tell it you third letter from same i did not understand your letter this morning this i told you because it was case i understand that this evening do not imagine i shall ever return answer it i am too anxious forget what it contains although you excite my pity i am not proof against bitterness with which it has filled my mind i descend trick cunning with you i accused blackest all infamies adieu i regret your having adieu i know not what i say adieu i shall be very anxious forgive you you will come when you please you will be better received than your suspicions deserve all i have desire you is not trouble yourself about my reputation opinion world concerning me is but little importance my esteem my conduct is good this is sufficient for me besides i am ignorant what has happened two persons who are dear me as they are you this last letter extricated me from terrible embarrassment threw me into another almost same magnitude although these letters answers were sent returned same day with extreme rapidity interval had been sufficient place another between my rage transport give me time reflect on enormity my imprudence madam d houdetot had not recommended me anything so much as remain quiet leave her care extricating herself avoid especially at that moment all noise rupture i by most open atrocious insults took properest means carrying rage its greatest height heart woman who was already but too well disposed it i now could naturally expect nothing from her but answer so haughty disdainful expressive contempt that i could not without utmost meanness do otherwise than immediately quit her house happily she more adroit than i was furious avoided by manner her answer reducing me that extremity but it was necessary either quit or immediately go see her alternative was inevitable i resolved on latter though i foresaw how much i must be embarrassed explanation for how was i get through it without exposing either madam d houdetot or theresa woe her whom i should have named there was nothing that vengeance implacable intriguing woman did not make me fear for person who should be object it it was prevent this misfortune that my letter i had spoken nothing but suspicions that i might not be under necessity producing my proofs this it is true rendered my transports less excusable no simple suspicions being sufficient authorize me treat woman especially friend manner i had treated madam d epinay but here begins noble task i worthily fulfilled expiating my faults secret weaknesses by charging myself with such former as i was incapable committing which i never did commit i had not bear attack i had expected fear was greatest evil i received from it at my approach madam d epinay threw her arms about my neck bursting into tears this unexpected reception by old friend extremely affected me i also shed many tears i said her few words which had not much meaning she uttered others with still less everything ended here supper was served we sat down table where expectation explanation i imagined be deferred until supper was over i made very poor figure for i am so overpowered by most trifling inquietude mind that i cannot conceal it from persons least clear sighted my embarrassed appearance must have given her courage yet she did not risk anything upon that foundation there was no more explanation after than before supper none took place on next day our little tete tete conversations consisted indifferent things or some complimentary words on my part by which while i informed her i could not say more relative my suspicions i asserted with greatest truth that if they were ill founded my whole life should be employed repairing injustice she did not show least curiosity know precisely what they were nor for what reason i had formed them all our peacemaking consisted on her part as well as on mine embrace at our first meeting since madam d epinay was only person offended at least form i thought it was not for me strive bring about eclaircissement for which she herself did not seem anxious i returned as i had come continuing besides live with her upon same footing as before i soon almost entirely forgot quarrel foolishly believed she had done same because she seemed not remember what had passed this it will soon appear was not only vexation caused me by weakness but i had others not less disagreeable which i had not brought upon myself only cause these was desire forcing me from my solitude by means tormenting me these originated from diderot d holbachiens that is take from it old woman who was wanted conspiracy it is astonishing that during this long quarrel my stupid confidence presented me from comprehending that it was not me but her whom they wanted paris since i had resided at hermitage diderot incessantly harrassed me either himself or by means de leyre i soon perceived from pleasantries latter upon my ramblings groves with what pleasure he had travestied hermit into gallant shepherd but this was not question my quarrels with diderot cause these were more serious after publication fils naturel he had sent me copy it which i had read with interest attention i ever bestowed on works friend reading kind poem annexed it i was surprised rather grieved find it amongst several things disobliging but supportable against men solitude this bitter severe sentence without least softening il n y que le m chant qui soit seul this sentence is equivocal seems present double meaning one true other false since it is impossible that man who is determined remain alone can do least harm anybody consequently he cannot be wicked sentence itself therefore required interpretation more so from author who when he sent it press had friend retired from world it appeared me shocking uncivil either have forgotten that solitary friend or remembering him not have made from general maxim honorable just exception which he owed not only his friend but so many respectable sages who all ages have sought for peace tranquillity retirement whom for first time since creation world writer took it into his head indiscriminately make so many villains i had great affection most sincere esteem for diderot fully depended upon his having same sentiments for me but tired with his indefatigable obstinacy continually opposing my inclinations taste manner living everything which related no person but myself shocked at seeing man younger than i was wish at all events govern me like child disgusted with his facility promising his negligence performing weary so many appointments given by himself capriciously broken while new ones were again given only be again broken displeased at uselessly waiting for him three or four times month on days he had assigned dining alone at night after having gone saint denis meet him waited whole day for his coming my heart was already full these multiplied injuries this last appeared me still more serious gave me infinite pain i wrote complain it but so mild tender manner that i moistened my paper with my tears my letter was sufficiently affecting have drawn others from himself it would be impossible guess his answer on this subject it was literally as follows i am glad my work has pleased affected you you are not my opinion relative hermits say as much good them as you please you will be only one world whom i shall think well even on this there would be much say were it possible speak you without giving you offence woman eighty years age etc

agreeable her pay her lodging have same care taken her as if she remained with me she rejected my offer assured me she was very well satisfied with hermitage that country air was service her this was

delightful abode being fond little amusements garden care fruit which she had handling but that she had said what she had been desired say induce me return paris failing this attempt they endeavored obtain by scruple effect which complaisance had not produced construed into crime my keeping old woman at distance from succors which at her age she might be need they did not recollect that she many other old people whose lives were prolonged by air country might obtain these succors at montmorency near which i lived as if there were no old people except paris that it was impossible for them live any other place madam le vasseur who ate great deal with extreme voracity was subject overflowings bile strong diarrhoeas which lasted several days served her instead clysters at paris she neither did nor took anything for them but left nature itself she observed same rule at hermitage knowing it was best thing she could do no matter since there were not country either physicians or apothecaries keeping her there must no doubt be with desire putting end her existence although she was perfect health diderot should have determined at what age under pain being punished for homicide it is no longer permitted let old people remain out paris this was one atrocious accusations from which he did not except me his remark that none but wicked were alone meaning his pathetic exclamation with et cetera which he had benignantly added woman eighty years age etc i thought best answer that could be given this reproach would be from madam le vasseur herself i desired her write freely naturally her sentiments madam d epinay relieve her from all constraint i would not see her letter i showed her that which i am going transcribe i wrote it madam d epinay upon subject answer i wished return letter

you will perceive your grief is not equal mine we suffer less by seeing persons we love ill than when they are unjust cruel adieu my good friend i shall never again mention you this unhappy affair you speak going paris with unconcern which at any other time would give me pleasure i wrote diderot telling him what i had done relative madam le vasseur upon proposal madam d epinay herself madam le vasseur having as it may be imagined chosen remain at hermitage where she enjoyed good state health always had company lived very agreeably diderot not knowing what else attribute me as crime construed my precaution into one discovered another madam le vasseur continuing reside at hermitage although this was by her own choice though her going paris had depended still depended upon herself where she would continue receive same succors from me as i gave her my house this is explanation first reproach letter diderot that second is letter which follows learned man name given joke by grimm son madam d epinay must have informed you there were upon rampart twenty poor persons who were dying with cold hunger waiting for farthing you customarily gave them this is specimen our little babbling if you understand rest it will amuse you perhap my answer this terrible argument which diderot seemed so proud was following words i think i answered learned man that is farmer general that i did not pity poor whom he had seen upon rampart waiting for my farthing that he had probably amply made it up them that i appointed him my substitute that poor paris would have no reason complain change that i should not easily find so good one for poor montmorency who were much greater need assistance here is good respectable old man who after having worked hard all his lifetime no longer being able continue his labors is his old days dying with hunger my conscience is more satisfied with two sous i give him every monday than with hundred farthings i should have distributed amongst all beggars on rampart you are pleasant men you philosophers while you consider inhabitants cities as only persons whom you ought befriend it is country men learn how love serve humanity all they learn cities is despise it such were singular scruples on which man sense had folly attribute me as crime my retiring from paris pretended prove me by my own example that it was not possible live out capital without becoming bad man i cannot at present conceive how i could be guilty folly answering him suffering myself be angry instead laughing his fare however decisions madam d epinay clamors coterie holbachique had so far operated her favor that i was generally thought be wrong d houdetot herself very partial diderot insisted upon my going see him at paris making all advances towards accommodation which full sincere as it was on my part was not long duration victorious argument by which she subdued my heart was that at that moment diderot was distress besides storm excited against encyclopedie he had then another violent one make head against relative his piece which notwithstanding short history he had printed at head it he was accused having entirely taken from goldoni diderot more wounded by criticisms than voltaire was overwhelmed by them madam de grasigny had been malicious enough spread report that i had broken with him on this account i thought it would be just generous publicly prove contrary i went pass two days not only with him but at his lodgings this since i had taken up my abode at hermitage was my second journey paris i had made first run poor gauffecourt who had had stroke apoplexy from which he has never perfectly recovered i did not quit side his pillow until he was so far restored as have no further need my assistance diderot received me well how many wrongs are effaced by embraces friend after these what resentment can remain heart we came but little explanation this is needless for reciprocal invectives only thing necessary is know how forget them there had been no underhand proceedings none at least that had come my knowledge case was not same with madam d epinay he showed me plan pere de famille this said i him is best defence fils naturel be silent give your attention this piece then throw it at head your enemies as only answer you think proper make them he did so was satisfied with what he had done i had six months before sent him first two parts my eloisa have his opinion upon them he had not yet read work over we read part it together he found this feuillet that was his term by which he meant loaded with words redundancies i myself had already perceived it but it was babbling fever i have never been able correct it last parts are not same fourth especially sixth are master pieces diction day after my arrival he would absolutely take me sup with m d holbach we were far from agreeing on this point for i wished even get rid bargain for manuscript on chemistry for which i was enraged be obliged that man diderot carried all before him he swore d holbach loved me with all his heart said i must forgive him his manner which was same everybody more disagreeable his friends than others he observed me that refusing produce this manuscript after having accepted it two years before was affront donor which he had not deserved that my refusal might be interpreted into secret reproach for having waited so long conclude bargain i see added he d holbach every day know better than you do nature his disposition had you reason be dissatisfied with him do you think your friend capable advising you do mean thing short with my accustomed weakness i suffered myself be prevailed upon we went sup with baron who received me as he usually had done but his wife received me coldly almost uncivilly i saw nothing her which resembled amiable caroline who when maid expressed for me so many good wishes i thought i had already perceived that since grimm had frequented house d aine i had not met there so friendly reception whilst i was at paris saint lambert arrived there from army as i was not acquainted with his arrival i did not see him until after my return country first at chevrette afterwards at hermitage which he came with madam d houdetot invited himself dinner with me it may be judged whether or not i received him with pleasure but i felt one still greater at seeing good understanding between my guests satisfied with not having disturbed their happiness i myself was happy being witness it i can safely assert that during whole my mad passion especially at moment which i speak had it been my power take from him madam d houdetot i would not have done it nor should i have so much as been tempted undertake it i found her so amiable her passion for saint lambert that i could scarcely imagine she would have been as much so had she loved me instead him without wishing disturb their union all i really desired her was permit herself be loved finally however violent my passion may have been for this lady i found it as agreeable be confidant as object her amours i never for moment considered her lover as rival but always as my friend it will be said this was not love be it so but it was something more as for saint lambert he behaved like honest judicious man as i was only person culpable so was i only one who was punished this however was with greatest indulgence he treated me severely but friendly manner i perceived i had lost something his esteem but not least part his friendship for this i consoled myself knowing it would be much more easy me recover one than other that he had too much sense confound involuntary weakness passion with vice character if even i were fault all that had passed i was but very little so had i first sought after his mistress had not he himself sent her me did not she come search me could i avoid receiving her what could i do they themselves had done evil i was person on whom it fell my situation they would have done as much as i did perhaps more for however estimable faithful madam d houdetot might be she was still woman her lover was absent opportunities were frequent temptations strong it would have been very difficult for her always have defended herself with same success against more enterprising man we certainly had done great deal our situation placing boundaries beyond which we never permitted ourselves pass although at bottom my heart i found evidence sufficiently honorable my favor so many appearances were against me that invincible shame always predominant me gave me his presence appearance guilt this he took advantage for purpose humbling me single circumstance will describe this reciprocal situation i read him after dinner letter i had written preceding year voltaire which saint lambert had heard speak whilst i was reading he fell asleep i lately so haughty at present so foolish dared not stop continued read whilst he continued snore such were my indignities such his revenge but his generosity never permitted him exercise them except between ourselves after his return army i found madam d houdetot greatly changed her manner with me at this i was as much surprised as if it had not been what i ought have expected it affected me more than it ought have done did me considerable harm it seemed that everything from which i expected cure still plunged deeper into my heart dart which i at length broke rather than draw out i was quite determined conquer myself leave no means untried change my foolish passion into pure lasting friendship for this purpose i had formed finest projects world for execution which concurrence madam d houdetot was necessary when i wished speak her i found her absent embarrassed i perceived i was no longer agreeable her that something had passed which she would not communicate me which i have never yet known this change impossibility knowing reason it grieved me heart she asked me for her letters these i returned her with fidelity which she did me insult doubt for moment this doubt was another wound given my heart with which she must have been so well acquainted she did me justice but not immediately i understood that examination packet i had sent her made her perceive her error i saw she reproached herself with it by which i was gainer something she could not take back her letters without returning me mine she told me she had burnt them this i dared doubt my turn i confess i doubt it at this moment no such letters as mine her were are never thrown into fire those eloisa have been found ardent heavens what would have been said these no no she who can inspire like passion will never have courage burn proofs it but i am not afraid her having made bad use them this i do not think her capable besides i had taken proper measures prevent it foolish but strong apprehension raillery had made me begin this correspondence manner secure my letters from all communication i carried familiarity i permitted myself with her my intoxication so far as speak her singular number but what theeing thouing she certainly could not be offended with it yet she several times complained but this was always useless her complaints had no other effect than that awakening my fears i besides could not suffer myself lose ground if these letters be not yet destroyed should they ever be made public world will see what manner i have loved grief caused me by coldness madam d houdetot certainty not having merited it made me take singular resolution complain it saint lambert himself while waiting effect letter i wrote him i sought dissipations which i ought sooner have had recourse fetes were given at chevrette for which i composed music pleasure honoring myself eyes madam d houdetot by talent she loved warmed my imagination another object still contributed give it animation this was desire author devin du village had showing he understood music for i had perceived some persons had for considerable time past endeavored render this doubtful at least with respect composition my beginning at paris ordeal through which i had several times passed there both at house m dupin that m de la popliniere quantity music i had composed during fourteen years midst most celebrated masters before their eyes finally opera muses gallantes that even devin motet i had composed for mademoiselle fel which she had sung at spiritual concert frequent conferences i had had upon this fine art with first composers all seemed prevent or dissipate doubt such nature this however existed even at chevrette mind m d epinay himself without appearing observe it i undertook compose him motet for dedication chapel chevrette i begged him make choice words he directed de linant tutor his son furnish me with these de linant gave me words proper subject week after i had received them motet was finished this time spite was my apollo never did better music come from my hand words began with ecce sedes hic tonantis i have since learned these were by santeuil that m de linant had without scruple appropriated them himself grandeur opening is suitable words rest motet is so elegantly harmonious that everyone was struck with it i had composed it for great orchestra d epinay procured best performers madam bruna italian singer sung motet was well accompanied composition succeeded so well that it was afterwards performed at spiritual concert where spite secret cabals notwithstanding it was badly executed it was twice generally applauded i gave for birthday m d epinay idea kind piece half dramatic half pantomimical which i also composed music grimm on his arrival heard speak my musical success hour afterwards not word more was said on subject but there no longer remained doubt not at least that i know my knowledge composition grimm was scarcely arrived at chevrette where i already did not much amuse myself before he made it insupportable me by airs i never before saw any person which i had no idea evening before he came i was dislodged from chamber favor contiguous that madam d epinay it was prepared for grimm instead it i was put into another further off this manner said i laughingly madam d epinay new comers displace those which are established she seemed embarrassed i was better acquainted same evening with reason for change learning that between her chamber that i had quitted there was private door which she had thought needless show me her intercourse with grimm was not secret either her own house or public not even her husband yet far from confessing it me confidant secrets more important her which was sure would be faithfully kept she constantly denied it strongest manner i comprehended this reserve proceeded from grimm who though intrusted with all my secrets did not choose i should be with any his however prejudiced i was favor this man by former sentiments which were not extinguished by real merit he had all was not proof against cares he took destroy it he received me like comte de tuffiere he scarcely deigned return my salute he never once spoke me prevented my speaking him by not making me any answer he everywhere passed first took first place without ever paying me least attention all this would have been supportable had he not accompanied it with shocking affectation which may be judged by one example taken from hundred one evening madam d epinay finding herself little indisposed ordered something for her supper be carried into her chamber went up stairs sup by side fire she asked me go with her which i did grimm came afterwards little table was already placed there were but two covers supper was served madam d epinay took her place on one side fire grimm took armed chair seated himself at other drew little table between them opened his napkin prepared himself for eating without speaking me single word madam d epinay blushed at his behavior induce him repair his rudeness offered me her place he said nothing nor did he ever look at me not being able approach fire i walked about chamber until cover was brought indisposed as i was older than himself longer acquainted house than he had been person who had introduced him there whom as favorite lady he ought have done honors it he suffered me sup at end table at distance from fire without showing me least civility his whole behavior me corresponded with this example it he did not treat me precisely as his inferior but he looked upon me as cipher i could scarcely recognize same grimm who at house prince de saxe gotha thought himself honored when i cast my eyes upon him i had still more difficulty reconciling this profound silence insulting haughtiness with tender friendship he professed for me those whom he knew be real friends it is true only proofs he gave it was pitying my wretched fortune which i did not complain compassionating my sad fate with which i was satisfied lamenting see me obstinately refuse benevolent services he said he wished render me thus was it he artfully made world admire his affectionate generosity blame my ungrateful misanthropy insensibly accustomed people imagine there was nothing more between protector like him wretch like myself than connection founded upon benefactions on one part obligations on other without once thinking friendship between equals for my part i have vainly sought discover what i was under obligation this new protector i had lent him money he had never lent me any i had attended him his illness he scarcely came see me mine i had given him all my friends he never had given me any his i had said everything i could his favor if ever he has spoken me it has been less publicly another manner he has never either rendered or offered me least service any kind how therefore was he my mecaenas what manner was i protected by him this was incomprehensible me still remains so it is true he was more or less arrogant with everybody but i was only person with whom he was brutally so i remember saint lambert once ready throw plate at his head upon his some measure giving him lie at table by vulgarly saying that is not true with his naturally imperious manner he had self sufficiency upstart became ridiculous by being extravagantly impertinent intercourse with great had so far intoxicated him that he gave himself airs which none but contemptible part them ever assume he never called his lackey but by eh as if amongst number his servants my lord had not known which was waiting when he sent him buy anything he threw money upon ground instead putting it into his hand short entirely forgetting he was man he treated him with such shocking contempt so cruel disdain everything that poor lad very good creature whom madam d epinay had recommended quitted his service without any other complaint than that impossibility enduring such treatment this was la fleur this new presuming upstart as these things were nothing more than ridiculous but quite opposite my character they contributed render him suspicious me i could easily imagine that man whose head was so much deranged could not have heart well placed he piqued himself upon nothing so much as upon sentiments how could this agree with defects which are peculiar little minds how can continued overflowings susceptible heart suffer it be incessantly employed so many little cares relative person he who feels his heart inflamed with this celestial fire strives diffuse it wishes show what he internally is he would wish place his heart his countenance thinks not other paint for his cheeks i remember summary his morality which madam d epinay had mentioned me adopted this consisted one single article that sole duty man is follow all inclinations his heart this morality when i heard it mentioned gave me great matter reflection although i at first considered it solely as play wit but i soon perceived it was principle really rule his conduct which i afterwards had at my own expense but too many convincing proofs it is interior doctrine diderot has so frequently intimated me but which i never heard him explain i remember having several years before been frequently told that grimm was false that he had nothing more than appearance sentiment particularly that he did not love me i recollected several little anecdotes which i had heard him by m de francueil madam de chenonceaux neither whom esteemed him whom he must have been known as madam de chenonceaux was daughter madam de rochechouart intimate friend late comte de friese that m de francueil at that time very intimate with viscount de polignac had lived good deal at palais royal precisely when grimm began introduce himself there all paris heard his despair after death comte de friese it was necessary support reputation he had acquired after rigors mademoiselle fel which i more than any other person should have seen imposture had i been less blind he was obliged be dragged hotel de castries where he worthily played his part abandoned most mortal affliction there he every morning went into garden weep at his ease holding before his eyes his handkerchief moistened with tears as long as he was sight hotel but at turning certain alley people whom he little thought saw him instantly put his handkerchief his pocket take out it book this observation which was repeatedly made soon became public paris was almost as soon forgotten i myself had forgotten it circumstance which i was concerned brought it my recollection i was at point death my bed rue de grenelle grimm was country he came one morning quite out breath see me saying he had arrived town that very instant moment afterwards i learned he had arrived evening before had been seen at theatre i heard many things same kind but observation which i was surprised not have made sooner struck me more than anything else i had given grimm all my friends without exception they were become his i was so inseparable from him that i should have had some difficulty continuing visit at house where he was not received madam de crequi was only person who refused admit him into her company whom for that reason i have seldom since seen grimm on his part made himself other friends as well by his own means as by those comte de friese all these not one them ever became my friend he never said word induce me even become acquainted with them not one those i sometimes met at his apartments ever showed me least good will comte de friese whose house he lived with whom it consequently would have been agreeable me form some connection not excepted nor comte de schomberg his relation with whom grimm was still more intimate add this my own friends whom i made his who were all tenderly attached me before this acquaintance were no longer so moment it was made he never gave me one his i gave him all mine these he has taken from me if these be effects friendship what are those enmity diderot himself told me several times at beginning that grimm whom i had so much confidence was not my friend he changed his language moment he was no longer so himself manner which i had disposed my children wanted not concurrence any person yet i informed some my friends it solely make it known them that i might not their eyes appear better than i was these friends were three number diderot grimm madam d epinay duclos most worthy my confidence was only real friend whom i did not inform it he nevertheless knew what i had done by whom this i know not it is not very probable perfidy came from madam d epinay who knew that by following her example had i been capable doing it i had my power means cruel revenge it remains therefore between grimm diderot then so much united especially against me it is probable this crime was common them both i would lay wager that duclos whom i never told my secret who consequently was at liberty make what use he pleased his information is only person who has not spoken it again grimm diderot their project take from me governesses had used greatest efforts make duclos enter into their views but this he refused do with disdain it was not until sometime afterwards that i learned from him what had passed between them on subject but i learned at time from theresa enough perceive there was some secret design that they wished dispose me if not against my own consent at least without my knowledge or had intention making these two persons serve as instruments some project they had view this was far from upright conduct opposition duclos is convincing proof it they who think proper may believe it be friendship this pretended friendship was as fatal me at home as it was abroad long frequent conversations with madam le vasseur for several years past had made sensible change this woman s behavior me change was far from being my favor what was subject these singular conversations why such profound mystery was conversation that old woman agreeable enough take her into favor sufficient importance make it so great secret during two or three years these colloquies had from time time been continued they had appeared me ridiculous but when i thought them again they began astonish me this astonishment would have been carried inquietude had i then known what old creature was preparing for me notwithstanding pretended zeal for my welfare which grimm made such public boast difficult reconcile with airs he gave himself when we were together i heard nothing him from any quarter least my advantage his feigned commiseration tended less do me service than render me contemptible he deprived me as much as he possibly could resource i found employment i had chosen by decrying me as bad copyist i confess he spoke truth but this case it was not for him do it he proved himself earnest by employing another copyist prevailing upon everybody he could by whom i was engaged do same his intention might have been supposed be that reducing me dependence upon him his credit for subsistence cut off latter until i was brought that degree distress all things considered my reason imposed silence upon my former prejudice which still pleaded his favor i judged his character be at least suspicious with respect his friendship i positively decided it be false i then resolved see him no more informed madam d epinay resolution i had taken supporting it with several unanswerable facts but which i have now forgotten she strongly combated my resolution without knowing how reply reasons on which it was founded she had not concerted with him but next day instead explaining herself verbally she with great address gave me letter they had drawn up together by which without entering into detail facts she justified him by his concentrated character attributed me as crime my having suspected him perfidy towards his friend exhorted me come accommodation with him this letter staggered me conversation we afterwards had together which i found her better prepared than she had been first time i suffered myself be quite prevailed upon was inclined believe i might have judged erroneously this case i thought i really had done friend very serious injury which it was my duty repair short as i had already done several times with diderot baron d holbach half from inclination half from weakness i made all advances i had right require i went m grimm like another george dandin make him my apologies for offence he had given me still false persuasion which course my life has made me guilty thousand meannesses my pretended friends that there is no hatred which may not be disarmed by mildness proper behavior whereas on contrary hatred wicked becomes still more envenomed by impossibility finding anything found it upon sentiment their own injustice is another cause offence against person who is object it i have without going further than my own history strong proof this maxim grimm tronchin both became my implacable enemies from inclination pleasure fancy without having been able charge me with having done either them most trifling injury whose rage like that tigers becomes daily more fierce by facility satiating it i did not give surname jongleur latter until long time after his enmity had been declared persecutions he brought upon me at geneva elsewhere i soon suppressed name moment i perceived i was entirely his victim mean vengeance is unworthy my heart hatred never takes least root it i expected that grimm confused by my condescension advances would receive me with open arms most tender friendship he received me as roman emperor would have done with haughtiness i never saw any person but himself i was by no means prepared for such reception when embarrassment part i had act which was so unworthy me i had few words with timid air fulfilled object which had brought me him before he received me into favor he pronounced with deal majesty harangue he had prepared which contained long enumeration his rare virtues especially those connected with friendship he laid great stress upon thing which at first struck me great deal this was his having always preserved same friends whilst he was yet speaking i said myself it would be cruel for me be only exception this rule he returned subject so frequently with such emphasis that i thought if this he followed nothing but sentiments his heart he would be less struck with maxim that he made it art useful his views by procuring means accomplishing them until then i had been same situation i had preserved all my first friends those even from my tenderest infancy without having lost one them except by death yet i had never before made reflection it was not maxim i had prescribed myself since therefore advantage was common both why did he boast it preference if he had not previously intended deprive me merit he afterwards endeavored humble me by proofs preference our common friends gave him with this i was as well acquainted as himself question was by what means he had obtained it whether it was by merit or address by exalting himself or endeavoring abase me at last when he had placed between us all distance that he could add value favor he was about confer he granted me kiss peace slight embrace which resembled accolade which king gives newmade knights i was stupefied with surprise i knew not what say not word could i utter whole scene had appearance reprimand preceptor gives his pupil while he graciously spares inflicting rod i never think it without perceiving what degree judgments founded upon appearances which vulgar give so much weight are deceitful how frequently audaciousness pride are found guilty shame embarrassment innocent we were reconciled this was relief my heart which every kind quarrel fills with anguish it will naturally be supposed that like reconciliation changed nothing his manners all it effected was deprive me right complaining them for this reason i took resolution endure everything for future say not word so many successive vexations overwhelmed me such degree as leave me but little power over my mind receiving no answer from saint lambert neglected by madam d houdetot no longer daring open my heart any person i began be afraid that by making friendship my idol i should sacrifice my whole life chimeras after putting all those with whom i had been acquainted test there remained but two who had preserved my esteem whom my heart could confide duclos whom since my retreat hermitage i had lost sight saint lambert i thought only means repairing wrongs i had done latter was open myself him without reserve i resolved confess him everything by which his mistress should not be exposed i have no doubt but this was another snare my passions keep me nearer her person but i should certainly have had no reserve with her lover entirely submitting his direction carrying sincerity as far as it was possible do it i was upon point writing him second letter which i was certain he would have returned answer when i learned melancholy cause his silence relative first he had been unable support until end fatigues campaign madam d epinay informed me he had had attack palsy madam d houdetot ill from affliction wrote me two or three days after from paris that he was going aix la chapelle take benefit waters i will not say this melancholy circumstance afflicted me as it did her but i am opinion my grief heart was as painful as her tears pain knowing him be such state increased by fear least inquietude should have contributed occasion it affected me more than anything that had yet happened i felt most cruelly want fortitude which my estimation was necessary enable me support so many misfortunes happily this generous friend did not long leave me so overwhelmed with affliction he did not forget me notwithstanding his attack i soon learned from himself that i had ill judged his sentiments been too much alarmed for his situation it is now time i should come grand revolution my destiny catastrophe which has divided my life two parts so different from each other from very trifling cause produced such terrible effects one day little thinking what was happen madam d epinay sent for me chevrette moment i saw her i perceived her eyes whole countenance appearance uneasiness which struck me more as this was not customary nobody knowing better than she did how govern her features her movements my friend said she me i am immediately going set off for geneva my breast is bad state my health so deranged that i must go consult tronchin i was more astonished at this resolution so suddenly taken at beginning bad season year as thirty six hours before she had not when i left her so much as thought it i asked her who she would take with her she said her son m de linant afterwards carelessly added you dear will not you go also as i did not think she spoke seriously knowing that at season year i was scarcely situation go my chamber i joked upon utility company one sick person another she herself had not seemed make proposition seriously here matter dropped rest our conversation ran upon necessary preparations for her journey about which she immediately gave orders being determined set off within fortnight she lost nothing by my refusal having prevailed upon her husband accompany her few days afterwards i received from diderot note i am going transcribe this note simply doubled up so that contents were easily read was addressed me at madam d epinay s sent m de linant tutor son confidant mother note from diderot i am naturally disposed love you am born give you trouble i am informed madam d epinay is

approbation others what i now write my good friend is acquit myself what i think i owe us both should my letter displease you throw it into fire let it be forgotten i salute love embrace you although trembling almost blind with rage whilst i read this epistle i remarked address with which diderot affected milder more polite language than he had done his former ones wherein he never went further than my dear without ever deigning add name friend i easily discovered secondhand means by which letter was conveyed me subscription manner form awkwardly betrayed manoeuvre for we commonly wrote each other by post or messenger montmorency this was first only time he sent me his letter by any other conveyance as soon as first transports my indignation permitted me write i with great precipitation wrote him following answer which i immediately carried from hermitage where i then was chevrette show it madam d epinay whom my blind rage i read contents as well as letter from diderot you cannot my dear friend either know magnitude obligations i am under madam d epinay what degree i am bound by them whether or not she is desirous my accompanying her that this is possible or reasons i may have for my noncompliance i have no objection discuss all these points with you but you will meantime confess that prescribing me so positively what i ought do without first enabling yourself judge matter is my dear philosopher acting very inconsiderately what is still worse i perceive opinion you give comes not from yourself besides my being but little disposed suffer myself be led by nose under your name by any third or fourth person i observe this secondary advice certain underhand dealing which ill agrees with your candor from which you will on your account as well as mine do well future abstain you are afraid my conduct should be misinterpreted but i defy heart like yours think ill mine others would perhaps speak better me if i resembled them more god preserve me from gaining their approbation let vile wicked watch over my conduct misinterpret my actions rousseau is not man be afraid them nor is diderot be prevailed upon hearken what they say if i am displeased with your letter you wish me throw it into fire pay no attention contents do you imagine that anything coming from you can be forgotten such manner you hold my dear friend my tears as cheap pain you give me as you do my life health cares you exhort me take could you but break yourself this your friendship would be more pleasing me i should be less be pitied on entering chamber madam d epinay i found grimm with her with which i was highly delighted i read them loud clear voice two letters with intrepidity which i should not have thought myself capable concluded with few observations not least derogatory it at this unexpected audacity man generally timid they were struck dumb with surprise i perceived that arrogant man look down upon ground not daring meet my eyes which sparkled with indignation but bottom his heart he from that instant resolved upon my destruction with madam d epinay i am certain concerted measures that effect before they separated it was much about this time that i at length received by madam d houdetot answer from saint lambert dated from wolfenb ttel few days after accident had happened him my letter which had been long delayed upon road this answer gave me consolation which i then stood so much need it was full assurance esteem friendship these gave me strength courage deserve them from that moment i did my duty but had saint lambert been less reasonable generous honest i was inevitably lost season became bad people began quit country madam d houdetot informed me day on which she intended come bid adieu valley gave me rendezvous at eaubonne this happened be same day on which madam d epinay left chevrette go paris for purpose completing preparations for her journey fortunately she set off morning i had still time go dine with her sister law i had letter from saint lambert my pocket read it over several times as i walked along this letter served me as shield against my weakness i made kept resolution seeing nothing madam d houdetot but my friend mistress saint lambert i passed with her tete tete four hours most delicious calm infinitely preferable even with respect enjoyment paroxysms burning fever which always until that moment i had had when her presence as she too well knew my heart not be changed she was sensible efforts i made conquer myself esteemed me more for them i had pleasure perceiving that her friendship for me was not extinguished she announced me approaching return saint lambert who although well enough recovered from his attack was unable bear fatigues war was quitting service come live peace with her we formed charming project intimate connection between us three had reason hope it would be lasting since it was founded on every sentiment by which honest susceptible hearts could be united we had moreover amongst us all knowledge talents necessary be sufficient ourselves without aid any foreign supplement alas abandoning myself hope so agreeable life i little suspected that which awaited me we afterwards spoke my situation with madam d epinay i showed her letter from diderot with my answer it i related her everything that had passed upon subject declared her my resolution quitting hermitage this she vehemently opposed by reasons all powerful over my heart she expressed me how much she could have wished i had been party geneva foreseeing she should inevitably be considered as having caused refusal which letter diderot seemed previously announce however as she was acquainted with my reasons she did not insist upon this point but conjured me avoid coming open rupture let it cost me what mortification it would palliate my refusal by reasons sufficiently plausible put away all unjust suspicions her having been cause it i told her task she imposed on me was not easy but that resolved expiate my faults at expense my reputation i would give preference hers everything that honor permitted me suffer it will soon be seen whether or not i fulfilled this engagement my passion was so far from having lost any part its force that i never my life loved my sophia so ardently tenderly as on that day but such was impression made upon me by letter saint lambert sentiment my duty horror which i held perfidy that during whole time interview my senses left me peace i was not so much as tempted kiss her hand at parting she embraced me before her servants this embrace so different from those i had sometimes stolen from her under foliage proved i was become master myself i am certain that had my mind undisturbed had time acquire more firmness three months would have cured me radically here ends my personal connections with madam d houdetot connections which each has been able judge by appearance according disposition his own heart but which passion inspired me by that amiable woman most lively passion perhaps man ever felt will be honorable our own eyes by rare painful sacrifice we both made duty honor love friendship we each had too high opinion other easily suffer ourselves do anything derogatory our dignity we must have been unworthy all esteem had we not set proper value upon one like this energy my sentiments which have rendered us culpable was that which prevented us from becoming so thus after long friendship for one these women strongest affection for other i bade them both adieu same day one never see her more other see her again twice upon occasions which i shall hereafter speak after their departure i found myself much embarrassed fulfill so many pressing contradictory duties consequences my imprudence had i been my natural situation after proposition refusal journey geneva i had only remain quiet everything was as it should be but i had foolishly made it affair which could not remain state it was explanation was absolutely necessary unless i quitted hermitage which i had just promised madam d houdetot not do at least for present moreover she had required me make known reasons for my refusal my pretended friends that it might not be imputed her yet i could not state true reason without doing outrage madam d epinay who certainly had right my gratitude for what she had done for me everything well considered i found myself reduced severe but indispensable necessity failing respect either madam d upinay madam d houdetot or myself it was last i resolved make my victim this i did without hesitation openly fully with so much generosity as make act worthy expiating faults which had reduced me such extremity this sacrifice taken advantage by my enemies which they perhaps did not expect has ruined my reputation by their assiduity deprived me esteem public but it has restored me my own given me consolation my misfortune this as it will hereafter appear is not last time i made such sacrifice nor that advantages were taken it do me injury grimm was only person who appeared have taken no part affair it was him i determined address myself i wrote him long letter which i set forth ridiculousness considering it as my duty accompany madam d epinay geneva inutility measure embarrassment even it would have caused her besides inconvenience myself i could not resist temptation letting him perceive this letter how fully i was informed what manner things were arranged that me it appeared singular i should be expected undertake journey whilst he himself dispensed with it that his name was never mentioned this letter wherein on account my not being able clearly state my reasons i was often obliged wander from text would have rendered me culpable eyes public but it was model reservedness discretion for people who like grimm were fully acquainted with things i forbore mention which justified my conduct i did not even hesitate raise another prejudice against myself attributing advice diderot my other friends this i did insinuate that madam d houdetot had been same opinion as she really was not mentioning that upon reasons i gave her she thought differently i could not better remove suspicion her having connived at my proceedings than appearing dissatisfied with her behavior this letter was concluded by act confidence which would have had effect upon any other man for desiring grimm weigh my reasons afterwards give me his opinion i informed him that let this be what it would i should act accordingly such was my intention had he even thought i ought set off for m d epinay having appointed himself conductor his wife my going with them would then have had different appearance whereas it was i who first place was asked take upon me that employment he was out question until after my refusal answer from grimm was slow incoming it was singular enough on which account i will here transcribe it departure madam d epinay is postponed her son is ill it is necessary wait until his health is re established i will consider contents your letter remain quiet at your hermitage i will send you my opinion as soon as this shall be necessary as she will certainly not set off for some days there is no immediate occasion for it meantime you may if you think proper make her your offers although this me seems matter indifference for knowing your situation as well as you do yourself i doubt not her returning your offer such answer as she ought do all advantage which my opinion can result from this will be your having it your power say those by whom you may be importuned that your not being travelling party was not for want having made your offers that effect moreover i do not see why you will absolutely have it that philosopher is speaking trumpet all world nor because he is opinion you ought go why you should imagine all your friends think as he does if you write madam d epinay her answer will be yours all your friends since you have it so much at heart give them all answer adieu i embrace madam le vasseur criminal m le vasseur whose wife governed him rather rudely called her lieutenant criminal grimm joke gave same name daughter by way abridgment was pleased retrench first word struck with astonishment at reading this letter i vainly endeavored find out what it meant how instead answering me with simplicity he took time consider what i had written as if time he had already taken was not sufficient he intimates even state suspense which he wishes keep me as if profound problem was be resolved or that it was importance his views deprive me every means comprehending his intentions until moment he should think proper make them known what therefore did he mean by these precautions delays mysteries was this manner acting consistent with honor uprightness i vainly sought for some favorable interpretation his conduct it was impossible find one whatever his design might be were this inimical me his situation facilitated execution it without its being possible for me mine oppose least obstacle favor house great prince having extensive acquaintance giving tone common circles which he was oracle he had it his power with his usual address dispose everything his favor i alone my hermitage far removed from all society without benefit advice having no communication with world had nothing do but remain peace all i did was write madam d epinay upon illness her son as polite letter as could be written but which i did not fall into snare offering accompany her geneva after waiting for long time most cruel uncertainty into which that barbarous man had plunged me i learned at expiration eight or ten days that madam d epinay was set off received from him second letter it contained not more than seven or eight lines which i did not entirely read it was rupture but such terms as most infernal hatred only can dictate these became unmeaning by excessive degree acrimony with which he wished charge them he forbade me his presence as he would have forbidden me his states all that was wanting his letter make it laughable was be read over with coolness without taking copy it or reading whole contents i returned it him immediately accompanied by following note i refused admit force just reasons i had suspicion i now when it is too late am become sufficiently acquainted with your character this then is letter upon which you took time meditate i return it you it is not for me you may show mine whole world hate me openly this on your part will be falsehood less my telling he might show my preceding letter related article his by which his profound address throughout whole affair will be judged i have observed that my letter might inculpate me eyes persons unacquainted with particulars what had passed this he was delighted discover but how was he take advantage it without exposing himself by showing letter he ran risk being reproached with abusing confidence his friend relieve himself from this embarrassment he resolved break with me most violent manner possible set forth his letter favor he did me not showing mine he was certain that my indignation anger i should refuse his feigned discretion permit him show my letter everybody this was what he wished for everything turned out as he expected it would he sent my letter all over paris with his own commentaries upon it which however were not so successful as he had expected them be it was not judged that permission he had extorted make my letter public exempted him from blame having so lightly taken me at my word do me injury people continually asked what personal complaints he had against me authorize so violent hatred finally it was thought that if even my behavior had been such as authorize him break with me friendship although extinguished had rights which he ought have respected but unfortunately inhabitants paris are frivolous remarks moment are soon forgotten absent unfortunate are neglected man who prospers secures favor by his presence intriguing malicious support each other renew their vile efforts effects these incessantly succeeding each other efface everything by which they were preceded thus after having so long deceived me this man threw aside his mask convinced that state which he had brought things he no longer stood need it relieved from fear being unjust towards wretch i left him his reflections thought no more him week afterwards i received answer from madam d epinay dated from geneva i understood from manner her letter which for first time her life she put on airs state with me that both depending but little upon success their measures considering me man inevitably lost their intentions were give themselves pleasure completing my destruction fact my situation was deplorable i perceived all my friends withdrew themselves from me without knowing how or for why diderot who boasted continuation his attachment who for three months past had promised me visit did not come winter began make its appearance brought with it my habitual disorders my constitution although vigorous had been unequal combat so many opposite passions i was so exhausted that i had neither strength nor courage sufficient resist most trifling indisposition had my engagements continued remonstrances diderot madam d houdetot then permitted me quit hermitage i knew not where go nor what manner drag myself along i remained stupid immovable idea alone step take letter write or word say made me tremble i could not however do otherwise than reply letter madam d epinay without acknowledging myself be worthy treatment with which she her friend overwhelmed me i determined upon notifying her my sentiments resolutions not doubting moment that from humanity generosity propriety good manner thinking i imagined i had observed her notwithstanding her bad one she would immediately subscribe them my letter was as follows hermitage 23d nov 1757 were it possible die grief i should not now be alive but i have at length determined triumph over everything friendship madam is extinguished between us but that which no longer exists still has its rights i respect them i have not forgotten your goodness me you may on my part expect as much gratitude as it is possible have towards person i no longer can love all further explanation would be useless i have my favor my own conscience i return you your letter i wished quit hermitage i ought have done it my friends pretend i must stay there until spring since my friends desire it i will remain there until that season if you will consent my stay after writing despatching this letter all i thought was remaining quiet at hermitage taking care my health endeavoring recover my strength taking measures remove spring without noise or making rupture public but these were not intentions either grimm or madam d epinay as it will presently appear few days afterwards i had pleasure receiving from diderot visit he had so frequently promised which he had as constantly failed he could not have come more opportunely he was my oldest friend almost only one who remained me pleasure i felt seeing him as things were circumstanced may easily be imagined my heart was full i disclosed it him i explained him several facts which either had not come his knowledge or had been disguised or suppressed i informed him as far as i could do it with propriety all that had passed i did not affect conceal from him that with which he was but too well acquainted that passion equally unreasonable unfortunate had been cause my destruction but i never acknowledged that madam d houdetot had been made acquainted with it or at least that i had declared it her i mentioned him unworthy manoeuvres madam d epinay intercept innocent letters her sister law wrote me i was determined he should hear particulars from mouth persons whom she had attempted seduce theresa related them with great precision but what was my astonishment when mother came speak i heard her declare maintain that nothing this had come her knowledge these were her words from which she would never depart not four days before she herself had recited me all particulars theresa had just stated presence my friend she contradicted me my face this me was decisive i then clearly saw my imprudence having so long time kept such woman near me i made no use invective i scarcely deigned speak her few words contempt i felt what i owed daughter whose steadfast uprightness was perfect contrast base monoeuvres mother but from instant my resolution was taken relative old woman i waited for nothing but moment put it into execution this presented itself sooner than i expected on 10th december i received from madam d epinay following answer my preceding letter geneva 1st december 1757 after having for several years given you every possible mark friendship all i can now do is pity you you are very unhappy i wish your conscience may be as calm as mine this may be necessary repose your whole life since you are determined quit hermitage are persuaded that you ought do it i am astonished your friends have prevailed upon you stay there for my part i never consult mine upon my duty i have nothing further say you upon your own such unforeseen dismission so fully pronounced left me not moment hesitate it was necessary quit immediately let weather my health be what state they might although i were sleep woods upon snow with which ground was then covered defiance everything madam d houdetot might say for i was willing do everything please her except render myself infamous i never had been so embarrassed my whole life as i then was but my resolution was taken i swore let what would happen not sleep at hermitage on night that day week i began prepare for sending away my effects resolving leave them open field rather than not give up key course week for i was determined everything should be done before letter could be written geneva answer it received i never felt myself so inspired with courage i had recovered all my strength honor indignation upon which madam d epinay had not calculated contributed restore me vigor fortune aided my audacity m mathas fiscal procurer heard my embarrassment he sent offer me little house he had his garden mont louis at montmorency i accepted it with eagerness gratitude bargain was soon concluded i immediately sent purchase little furniture add that we already had my effects i had carted away with deal trouble great expense notwithstanding ice snow my removal was completed couple days on fifteenth december i gave up keys hermitage after having paid wages gardener not being able pay my rent with respect madam le vasseur i told her we must part her daughter attempted make me renounce my resolution but i was inflexible i sent her off paris carriage messenger with all furniture effects she her daughter had common i gave her some money engaged pay her lodging with her children or elsewhere provide for her subsistence as much as it should be possible for me do it never let her want bread as long as i should have it myself finally day after my arrival at mont louis i wrote madam d epinay following letter montmorency 17th december 1757 nothing madam is so natural necessary as leave your house moment you no longer approve my remaining there upon you refusing your consent my passing rest winter at hermitage i quitted it on fifteenth december my destiny was enter it spite myself leave it same i thank you for residence you prevailed upon me make there i would thank you still more had i paid for it less dear you are right believing me unhappy nobody upon earth knows better than yourself what degree i must be so if being deceived choice our friends be misfortune it is another not less cruel recover from so pleasing error such is faithful narrative my residence at hermitage reasons which obliged me leave it i could not break off recital it was necessary continue it with greatest exactness this epoch my life having had upon rest it influence which will extend my latest remembrance book x illustration 0156 extraordinary degree strength momentary effervescence had given me quit hermitage left me moment i was out it i was scarcely established my new habitation before i frequently suffered from retentions which were accompanied by new complaint that rupture from which i had for some time without knowing what it was felt great inconvenience i soon was reduced most cruel state physician thieiry my old friend came see me made me acquainted with my situation sight all apparatus infirmities years made me severely feel that when body is no longer young heart is not so with impunity fine season did not restore me i passed whole year 1758 state languor which made me think i was almost at end my career i saw with impatience closing scene approach recovered from chimeras friendship detached from everything which had rendered life desirable me i saw nothing more it that could make it agreeable all i perceived was wretchedness misery which prevented me from enjoying myself i sighed after moment when i was be free escape from my enemies but i must follow order events my retreat montmorency seemed disconcert madam d epinay probably she did not expect it my melancholy situation severity season general dereliction me by my friends all made her grimm believe that by driving me last extremity they should oblige me implore mercy thus by vile meanness render myself contemptible be suffered remain asylum which honor commanded me leave i left it so suddenly that they had not time prevent step from being taken they were reduced alternative double or quit endeavor ruin me entirely or prevail upon me return grimm chose former but i am opinion madam d epinay would have preferred latter this from her answer my last letter which she seemed have laid aside airs she had given herself preceding ones give opening accommodation long delay this answer for which she made me wait whole month sufficiently indicates difficulty she found giving it proper turn deliberations by which it was preceded she could not make any further advances without exposing herself but after her former letters my sudden retreat from her house it is impossible not be struck with care she takes this letter not suffer offensive expression escape her i will copy it at length enable my reader judge what she wrote geneva january 17 1758 sir i did not receive your letter 17th december until yesterday it was sent me box filled with different things which has been all this time upon road i shall answer only postscript you may recollect sir that we agreed wages gardener hermitage should pass through your hands better make him feel that he depended upon you avoid ridiculous indecent scenes which happened time his predecessor as proof this first quarter his wages were given you few days before my departure we agreed i should reimburse you what you had advanced i know that this you at first made some difficulty but i had desired you make these advances it was natural i should acquit myself towards you this we concluded upon cahouet informs me that you refused receive money there is certainly some mistake matter i have given orders that it may again be offered you i see no reason for your wishing pay my gardener notwithstanding our conventions beyond term even your inhabiting hermitage i therefore expect sir that recollecting everything i have honor state you will not refuse be reimbursed for sums you have been pleased advance for me after what had passed not having least confidence madam d epinay i was unwilling renew my connection with her i returned no answer this letter there our correspondence ended perceiving i had taken my resolution she took hers entering into all views grimm coterie holbachique she united her efforts with theirs accomplish my destruction whilst they manoevured at paris she did same at geneva grimm who afterwards went her there completed what she had begun tronchin whom they had no difficulty gaining over seconded them powerfully became most violent my persecutors without having against me any more than grimm had least subject complaint they all three spread silence that which effects were seen there four years afterwards they had more trouble at paris where i was better known citizens whose hearts less disposed hatred less easily received its impressions better direct their blow they began by giving out that it was i who had left them thence still feigning be my friends they dexterously spread their malignant accusations by complaining injustice their friend their auditors thus thrown off their guard listened more attentively what was said me were inclined blame my conduct secret accusations perfidy ingratitude were made with greater precaution by that means with greater effect i knew they imputed me most atrocious crimes without being able learn what these consisted all i could infer from public rumor was that this was founded upon four following capital offences my retiring country my passion for madam d houdetot my refusing accompany madam d epinay geneva my leaving hermitage if these they added other griefs they took their measures so well that it has hitherto been impossible for me learn subject them it is therefore at this period that i think i may fix establishment system since adopted by those by whom my fate has been determined which has made such progress as will seem miraculous persons who know not with what facility everything which favors malignity man is established i will endeavor explain few words what me appeared visible this profound obscure system with name already distinguished known throughout all europe i had still preserved my primitive simplicity my mortal aversion all party faction cabal had kept me free independent without any other chain than attachments my heart alone stranger without family or fortune unconnected with everything except my principles duties i intrepidly followed paths uprightness never flattering or favoring any person at expense truth justice besides having lived for two years past solitude without observing course events i was unconnected with affairs world not informed what passed nor desirous being acquainted with it i lived four leagues from paris as much separated from that capital by my negligence as i should have been island tinian by sea grimm diderot d holbach were on contrary centre vortex lived great world divided amongst them almost all spheres it great wits men letters men long robe women all listened them when they chose act concert advantage three men this situation united must have over fourth mine cannot but already appear it is true diderot d holbach were incapable at least i think so forming black conspiracies one them was not base enough nor other sufficiently able but it was for this reason that party was more united grimm alone formed his plan his own mind discovered more it than was necessary induce his associates concur execution ascendency he had gained over them made this quite easy effect whole answered superiority his talents it was with these which were superior kind that perceiving advantage he might acquire from our respective situations he conceived project overturning my reputation without exposing himself giving me one nature quite opposite by raising up about me edifice obscurity which it was impossible for me penetrate by that means throw light upon his manoevures unmask him this enterprise was difficult because it was necessary palliate iniquity eyes those whose assistance he stood need he had honest men deceive alienate from me good opinion everybody deprive me all my friends what say i he had cut off all communication with me that not single word truth might reach my ears had single man generosity come said me you assume appearance virtue yet this is manner which you are treated these circumstances by which you are judged what have you say truth would have triumphed grimm have been undone this he was fully convinced but he had examined his own heart estimated men according their merit i am sorry for honor humanity that he judged with so much truth these dark crooked paths his steps be more sure were necessarily slow he has for twelve years pursued his plan most difficult part execution it is still come this is deceive public entirely he is afraid this public dares not lay his conspiracy open since this was written he has made dangerous step with fullest most inconceivable success i am opinion it was tronchin who inspired him with courage supplied him with means but he has found easy means accompanying it with power this power has disposal me thus supported he advances with less danger agents power piquing themselves but little on uprightness still less on candor he has no longer indiscretion honest man fear his safety is my being enveloped impenetrable obscurity concealing from me his conspiracy well knowing that with whatever art he may have formed it i could by single glance eye discover whole his great address consists appearing favor whilst he defames me giving his perfidy air generosity i felt first effects this system by secret accusations coterie holbachique without its being possible for me know what accusations consisted or form probable conjecture as nature them de leyre informed me his letters that heinous things were attributed me diderot more mysteriously told me same thing when i came explanation with both whole was reduced heads accusation which i have already spoken i perceived gradual increase coolness letters from madam d houdetot this i could not attribute saint lambert he continued write me with same friendship came see me after his return it was also impossible think myself cause it as we had separated well satisfied with each other nothing since that time had happened on my part except my departure from hermitage which she felt necessity therefore not knowing whence this coolness which she refused acknowledge although my heart was not be deceived could proceed i was uneasy upon every account i knew she greatly favored her sister law grimm consequence their connections with saint lambert i was afraid their machinations this agitation opened my wounds rendered my correspondence so disagreeable as quite disgust her with it i saw as at distance thousand cruel circumstances without discovering anything distinctly i was situation most insupportable man whose imagination is easily heated had i been quite retired from world known nothing matter i should have become more calm but my heart still clung attachments by means which my enemies had great advantages over me feeble rays which penetrated my asylum conveyed me nothing more than knowledge blackness mysteries which were concealed from my eyes i should have sunk i have not doubt it under these torments too cruel insupportable my open disposition which by impossibility concealing my sentiments makes me fear everything from those concealed from me if fortunately objects sufficiently interesting my heart divert it from others with which spite myself my imagination was filled had not presented themselves last visit diderot paid me at hermitage he had spoken article geneva which d alembert had inserted encyclopedie he had informed me that this article concerted with people first consideration had for object establishment theatre at geneva that measures had been taken accordingly that establishment would soon take place as diderot seemed think all this very proper did not doubt success measure as i had besides speak him upon too many other subjects touch upon that article i made him no answer but scandalized at these preparatives corruption licentiousness my country i waited with impatience for volume encyclopedie which article was inserted see whether or not it would be possible give answer which might ward off blow i received volume soon after my establishment at mont louis found articles be written with much art address worthy pen whence it proceeded this however did not abate my desire answer it notwithstanding dejection spirits i then labored under my griefs pains severity season inconvenience my new abode which i had not yet had time arrange myself i set work with zeal which surmounted every obstacle severe winter month february situation i have described i went every day morning evening pass couple hours open alcove which was at bottom garden which my habitation stood this alcove which terminated alley terrace looked upon valley pond montmorency presented me as closing point prospect plain but respectable castle st gratien retreat virtuous catinat it was this place then exposed freezing cold that without being sheltered from wind snow having no other fire than that my heart i composed space three weeks my letter d alembert on theatres it was this for my eloisa was not then half written that i found charms philosophical labor until then virtuous indignation had been substitute apollo tenderness gentleness mind now became so injustice i had been witness had irritated me that which i became object rendered me melancholy this melancholy without bitterness was that heart too tender affectionate which deceived by those whom it had confided was obliged remain concentred full that which had befallen me still affected by so many violent emotions my heart added sentiment its sufferings ideas with which meditation on my subject had inspired me what i wrote bore evident marks this mixture without perceiving it i described situation i was then gave portraits grimm madam d epinay madam d houdetot saint lambert myself what delicious tears did i shed as i wrote alas these descriptions there are proofs but too evident that love fatal love which i made such efforts cure myself still remained my heart with all this there was certain sentiment tenderness relative myself i thought i was dying imagined i bid public my last adieu far from fearing death i joyfully saw it approach but i felt some regret at leaving my fellow creatures without their having perceived my real merit being convinced how much i should have deserved their esteem had they known me better these are secret causes singular manner which this work opposite that work by which it was preceded is written discours sur l inegalite discourse on inequality mankind i corrected copied letter was preparing print it when after long silence i received one from madam d houdetot which brought upon me new affliction more painful than any i had yet suffered she informed me that my passion for her was known all paris that i had spoken it persons who had made it public that this rumor having reached ears her lover had nearly cost him his life yet he did her justice peace was restored between them but on his account as well as on hers for sake her reputation she thought it her duty break off all correspondence with me at same time assuring me that she her friend were both interested my welfare that they would defend me public that she herself would from time time send inquire after my health thou also diderot exclaimed i unworthy friend i could not however yet resolve condemn him my weakness was known others who might have spoken it i wished doubt but this was soon out my power saint lambert shortly after performed action worthy himself knowing my manner thinking he judged state which i must be betrayed by one part my friends forsaken by other he came see me first time he had not many moments spare he came again unfortunately not expecting him i was not at home theresa had with him conversation upwards two hours which they informed each other facts great importance us all surprise with which i learned that nobody doubted my having lived with madam d epinay as grimm then did cannot be equalled except by that saint lambert when he was convinced that rumor was false he great dissatisfaction lady was same situation with myself eclaircissements resulting from conversation removed from me all regret on account my having broken with her forever relative madam d houdetot he mentioned several circumstances with which neither theresa nor madam d houdetot herself were acquainted these were known me only first instance i had never mentioned them except diderot under seal friendship it was saint lambert himself whom he had chosen communicate them this last step was sufficient determine me i resolved break with diderot forever this without further deliberation except on manner doing it for i had perceived secret ruptures turned my prejudice because they left mask friendship possession my most cruel enemies rules good breeding established world on this head seem have been dictated by spirit treachery falsehood appear friend man when reality we are no longer so is reserve ourselves means doing him injury by surprising honest men into error i recollected that when illustrious montesquieu broke with father de tournemine he immediately said everybody listen neither father tournemine nor myself when we speak each other for we are no longer friends this open generous proceeding was universally applauded i resolved follow example with diderot but what method was i take publish rupture authentically from my retreat yet without scandal i concluded on inserting form note my work passage from book ecclesiasticus which declared rupture even subject it terms sufficiently clear such as were acquainted with previous circumstances but could signify nothing rest world i determined not speak my work friend whom i renounced except with honor always due extinguished friendship whole may be seen work itself there is nothing this world but time misfortune every act courage seems be crime adversity for that which has been admired montesquieu i received only blame reproach as soon as my work was printed i had copies it i sent one saint lambert who evening before had written me his own name that madam d houdetot note expressive most tender friendship following is letter he wrote me when he returned copy i had sent him eaubonne 10th october 1758 indeed sir i cannot accept present you have just made me that part your preface where relative diderot you quote passage from ecclesiastes he mistakes it is from ecclesiasticus book dropped from my hand conversations we had together summer you seemed be persuaded diderot was not guilty pretended indiscretions you had imputed him you may for aught i know contrary have reason complain him but this does not give you right insult him publicly you are not unacquainted with nature persecutions he suffers you join voice old friend that envy i cannot refrain from telling you sir how much this heinous act yours has shocked me i am not acquainted with diderot but i honor him i have lively sense pain you give man whom at least not my hearing you have never reproached with anything more than trifling weakness you i sir differ too much our principles ever be agreeable each other forget that i exist this you will easily do i have never done men either good or evil nature be long remembered i promise you sir forget your person remember nothing relative you but your talents this letter filled me with indignation affliction excess my pangs feeling my pride wounded i answered him by following note montmorency 11th october 1758 sir while reading your letter i did you honor be surprised at it had weakness suffer it affect me but i find it unworthy answer i will no longer continue copies madam d houdetot if it be not agreeable her keep that she has she may send it me back i will return her money if she keeps it she must still send for rest her paper money at same time i beg she will return me prospectus which she has her possession adieu sir courage under misfortune irritates hearts cowards but it is pleasing generous minds this note seemed make saint lambert reflect with himself regret his having been so violent but too haughty his turn make open advances he seized perhaps prepared opportunity palliating what he had done fortnight afterwards i received from madam d epinay following letter thursday 26th sir i received book you had goodness send me which i have read with much pleasure i have always experienced same sentiment reading all works which have come from your pen receive my thanks for whole i should have returned you these person had my affairs permitted me remain any time your neighborhood but i was not this year long at chevrette m madam dupin come there on sunday dinner i expect m de saint lambert m de francueil madam d houdetot will be party you will do me much pleasure by making one also all persons who are dine with me desire will as well as myself be delighted pass with you part day i have honor be with most perfect consideration etc this letter made my heart beat violently after having for year past been subject conversation all paris idea presenting myself as spectacle before madam d houdetot made me tremble i had much difficulty find sufficient courage support that ceremony yet as she saint lambert were desirous it madam d epinay spoke name her guests without naming one whom i should not be glad see i did not think i should expose myself accepting dinner which i was some degree invited by all persons who with myself were partake it i therefore promised go on sunday weather was bad madam d epinay sent me her carriage my arrival caused sensation i never met better reception observer would have thought whole company felt how much i stood need encouragement none but french hearts are susceptible this kind delicacy however i found more people than i expected see amongst others comte d houdetot whom i did not know his sister madam de blainville without whose company i should have been as well pleased she had year before came several times eaubonne her sister law had left her our solitary walks wait until she thought proper suffer her join us she had harbored resentment against me which during this dinner she gratified at her ease presence comte d houdetot saint lambert did not give me laugh on my side it may be judged that man embarrassed most common conversations was not very brilliant that which then took place i never suffered so much appeared so awkward or received more unexpected mortifications as soon as we had risen from table i withdrew from that wicked woman i had pleasure seeing saint lambert madam d houdetot approach me we conversed together part afternoon upon things very indifferent it is true but with same familiarity as before my involuntary error this friendly attention was not lost upon my heart could saint lambert have read what passed there he certainly would have been satisfied with it i can safely assert that although on my arrival presence madam d houdetot gave me most violent palpitations on returning from house i scarcely thought her my mind was entirely taken up with saint lambert notwithstanding malignant sarcasms madam de blainville dinner was great service me i congratulated myself upon not having refused invitation i not only discovered that intrigues grimm holbachiens had not deprived me my old acquaintance but what flattered me still more that madam d houdetot saint lambert were less changed than i had imagined i at length understood that his keeping her at distance from me proceeded more from jealousy than from disesteem such simplicity my heart was my opinion when i wrote these confessions this was consolation me calmed my mind certain not being object contempt eyes persons whom i esteemed i worked upon my own heart with greater courage success if i did not quite extinguish it guilty unhappy passion i at least so well regulated remains it that they have never since that moment led me into most trifling error copies madam d houdetot which she prevailed upon me take again my works which i continued send her as soon as they appeared produced me from her few notes messages indifferent but obliging she did still more as will hereafter appear reciprocal conduct her lover myself after our intercourse had ceased may serve as example manner which persons honor separate when it is no longer agreeable them associate with each other another advantage this dinner procured me was its being spoken paris where it served as refutation rumor spread by my enemies that i had quarrelled with every person who partook it especially with m d epinay when i left hermitage i had written him very polite letter thanks which he answered not less politely mutual civilities had continued as well between us as between me m de la lalive his brother law who even came see me at montmorency sent me some his engravings excepting two sisters law madam d houdetot i have never been on bad terms with any person family my letter d alembert had great success all my works had been very well received but this was more favorable me it taught public guard against insinuations coterie holbachique when i went hermitage this coterie predicted with its usual sufficiency that i should not remain there three months when i had stayed there twenty months was obliged leave it i still fixed my residence country coterie insisted this was from motive pure obstinacy that i was weary even death my retirement but that eaten up with pride i chose rather become victim my stubbornness than recover from it return paris letter d alembert breathed gentleness mind which every one perceived not be affected had i been dissatisfied with my retreat my style manner would have borne evident marks my ill humor this reigned all works i had written paris but first i wrote country not least appearance it was be found persons who knew how distinguish this remark was decisive they perceived i was returned my element yet same work notwithstanding all mildness it breathed made me by mistake my own my usual ill luck another enemy amongst men letters i had become acquainted with marmontel at house m de la popliniere his acquaintance had been continued at that baron marmontel at that time wrote mercure de france as i had too much pride send my works authors periodical publications wishing send him this without his imagining it was consequence that title or being desirous he should speak it mercure i wrote upon book that it was not for author mercure but for m marmontel i thought i paid him fine compliment he mistook it for cruel offence became my irreconcilable enemy he wrote against letter with politeness it is true but with bitterness easily perceptible since that time has never lost opportunity injuring me society indirectly ill treating me his works such difficulty is there managing irritable self love men letters so careful ought every person be not leave anything equivocal compliments they pay them having nothing more disturb me i took advantage my leisure independence continue my literary pursuits with more coherence i this winter finished my eloisa sent it rey who had it printed year following i was however interrupted my projects by circumstance sufficiently disagreeable i heard new preparations were making at opera house give devin du village enraged at seeing these people arrogantly dispose my property i again took up memoir i had sent m d argenson which no answer had been returned having made some trifling alterations it i sent manuscript by m sellon resident from geneva letter with which he was pleased charge himself comte de st florentin who had succeeded m d argenson opera department duclos whom i communicated what i had done mentioned it petits violons who offered restore me not my opera but my freedom theatre which i was no longer situation enjoy perceiving i had not from any quarter least justice expect i gave up affair directors opera without either answering or listening my reasons have continued dispose as their own property turn their profit devin du village which incontestably belongs nobody but myself since i had shaken off yoke my tyrants i led life sufficiently agreeable peaceful deprived charm too strong attachments i was delivered from weight their chains disgusted with friends who pretended be my protectors wished absolutely dispose me at will spite myself subject me their pretended good services i resolved future have no other connections than those simple benevolence these without least constraint upon liberty constitute pleasure society which equality is basis i had them as many as were necessary enable me taste charm liberty without being subject dependence it as soon as i had made experiment this manner life i felt it was most proper my age end my days peace far removed from agitations quarrels cavillings which i had just been half submerged during my residence at hermitage after my settlement at montmorency i had made neighborhood some agreeable acquaintance which did not subject me any inconvenience principal these was young loyseau de mauleon who then beginning plead at bar did not yet know what rank he would one day hold there i for my part was not least doubt about matter i soon pointed out him illustrious career midst which he is now seen predicted that if he laid down himself rigid rules for choice causes never became defender anything but virtue justice his genius elevated by this sublime sentiment would be equal that greatest orators he followed my advice now feels good effects it his defence m de portes is worthy demosthenes he came every year within quarter league hermitage pass vacation at st brice fief mauleon belonging his mother where great bossuet had formerly lodged this is fief which like succession proprietors would render nobility difficult support i had also for neighbor same village st brice bookseller guerin man wit learning amiable disposition one first his profession he brought me acquainted with jean neaulme bookseller amsterdam his friend correspondent who afterwards printed emilius i had another acquaintance still nearer than st brice this was m maltor vicar groslay man better adapted for functions statesman minister than for those vicar village whom diocese at least would have been given govern if talents decided disposal places he had been secretary comte de luc was formerly intimately acquainted with jean bapiste rousseau holding as much esteem memory that illustrious exile as he held villain who ruined him horror he possessed curious anecdotes both which segur had not inserted life still manuscript former he assured me that comte de luc far from ever having had reason complain his conduct had until his last moment preserved for him warmest friendship m maltor whom m de vintimille gave this retreat after death his patron had formerly been employed many affairs which although far advanced years he still preserved distinct remembrance reasoned upon them tolerably well his conversation equally amusing instructive had nothing it resembling that village pastor he joined manners man world knowledge one who passes his life study he all my permanent neighbors was person whose society was most agreeable me i was also acquainted at montmorency with several fathers oratory amongst others father berthier professor natural philosophy whom notwithstanding some little tincture pedantry i become attached on account certain air cordial good nature which i observed him i had however some difficulty reconcile this great simplicity with desire art he had everywhere thrusting himself into company great as well as that women devotees philosophers he knew how accommodate himself every one i was greatly pleased with man spoke my satisfaction all my other acquaintances apparently what i said him came his ear he one day thanked me for having thought him good natured man i observed something his forced smile which my eyes totally changed his physiognomy which has since frequently occurred my mind i cannot better compare this smile than that panurge purchasing sheep dindenaut our acquaintance had begun little time after my arrival at hermitage which place he frequently came see me i was already settled at montmorency when he left it go reside at paris he often saw madam le vasseur there one day when i least expected anything kind he wrote me behalf that woman informing me that grimm offered maintain her ask my permission accept offer this i understood consisted pension three hundred livres that madam le vasseur was come live at deuil between chevrette montmorency i will not say what impression application made on me it would have been less surprising had grimm had ten thousand livres year or any relation more easy comprehend with that woman had not such crime been made my taking her country where as if she had become younger he was now pleased think placing her i perceived good old lady had no other reason for asking my permission which she might easily have done without but fear losing what i already gave her should i think ill step she took although this charity appeared be very extraordinary it did not strike me so much then as afterwards but had i known even everything i have since discovered i should still as readily have given my consent as i did was obliged do unless i had exceeded offer m grimm father berthier afterwards cured me little my opinion his good nature cordiality with which i had so unthinkingly charged him this same father berthier was acquainted with two men who for what reason i know not were become so with me there was but little similarity between their taste mine they were children melchisedec whom neither country nor family was known no more than all probability real name they were jansenists passed for priests disguise perhaps on account their ridiculous manner wearing long swords which they appeared have been fastened prodigious mystery all their proceedings gave them appearance heads party i never had least doubt their being authors gazette ecclesiastique one tall smooth tongued sharping was named ferrand other short squat sneerer punctilious was m minard they called each other cousin they lodged at paris with d alembert house his nurse named madam rousseau had taken at montmorency little apartment pass summers there they did everything for themselves had neither servant nor runner each had his turn weekly purchase provisions do business kitchen sweep house they managed tolerably well we sometimes ate with each other i know not for what reason they gave themselves any concern about me for my part my only motive for beginning acquaintance with them was their playing at chess make poor little party i suffered four hours fatigue as they thrust themselves into all companies wished intermeddle everything theresa called them gossips by this name they were long known at montmorency such with my host m mathas who was good man were my principal country acquaintance i still had sufficient number at paris live there agreeably whenever i chose it out sphere men letters amongst whom duclos was only friend i reckoned for de leyre was still too young although after having been witness manoeuvres philosophical tribe against me he had withdrawn from it at least i thought so i could not yet forget facility with which he made himself mouthpiece all people that description first place i had my old respectable friend roguin this was good old fashioned friend for whom i was not indebted my writings but myself whom for that reason i have always preserved i had good lenieps my countryman his daughter then alive madam lambert i had young genevese named coindet good creature careful officious zealous who came see me soon after i had gone reside at hermitage without any other introducer than himself had made his way into my good graces he had taste for drawing was acquainted with artists he was service me relative engravings new eloisa he undertook direction drawings plates acquitted himself well commission i had free access house m dupin which less brilliant than young days madam dupin was still by merit heads family choice company which assembled there one best houses paris as i had not preferred anybody them had separated myself from their society live free independent they had always received me friendly manner i was always certain being well received by madam dupin i might even have counted her amongst my country neighbors after her establishment at clichy which place i sometimes went pass day or two where i should have been more frequently had madam dupin madam de chenonceaux been upon better terms but difficulty dividing my time same house between two women whose manner thinking was unfavorable each other made this disagreeable however i had pleasure seeing her more at my ease at deuil where at trifling distance from me she had taken small house even at my own habitation where she often came see me i had likewise for friend madam de crequi who having become devout no longer received d alembert marmontel nor single man letters except i believe abbe trublet half hypocrite whom she was weary i whose acquaintance she had sought lost neither her good wishes nor intercourse she sent me young fat pullets from mons her intention was come see me year following had not journey upon which madam de luxembourg determined prevented her i here owe her place apart she will always hold distinguished one my remembrance this list i should also place man whom except roguin i ought have mentioned as first upon it my old friend brother politician de carrio formerly titulary secretary embassy from spain venice afterwards sweden where he was charge des affaires at length really secretary embassy from spain at paris he came surprised me at montmorency when i least expected him he was decorated with insignia spanish order name which i have forgotten with fine cross jewelry he had been obliged his proofs nobility add letter his name bear that chevalier de carrion i found him still same man possessing same excellent heart his mind daily improving becoming more more amiable we would have renewed our former intimacy had not coindet interposed according custom taken advantage distance i was at from town insinuate himself into my place my name into his confidence supplant me by excess his zeal render me services remembrance carrion makes me recollect one my country neighbors whom i should be inexcusable not speak as i have make confession unpardonable neglect which i was guilty towards him this was honest m le blond who had done me service at venice having made excursion france with his family had taken house country at birche not far from montmorency when i wrote this full my blind confidence i was far from suspecting real motive effect his journey paris as soon as i heard he was my neighbor i joy my heart making it more pleasure than duty went pay him visit i set off upon this errand next day i was met by people who were coming see me with whom i was obliged return two days afterwards i set off again for same purpose he had dined at paris with all his family third time he was at home i heard voice women saw at door coach which alarmed me i wished see him at least for first time quite at my ease that we might talk over what had passed during our former connection fine i so often postponed my visit from day day that shame discharging like duty so late prevented me from doing it at all after having dared wait so long i no longer dared present myself this negligence at which m le blond could not but be justly offended gave relative him appearance ingratitude my indolence yet i felt my heart so little culpable that had it been my power do m le blond least service even unknown himself i am certain he would not have found me idle but indolence negligence delay little duties be fulfilled have been more prejudicial me than great vices my greatest faults have been omissions i have seldom done what i ought not have done unfortunately it has still more rarely happened that i have done what i ought since i am now upon subject my venetian acquaintance i must not forget one which i still preserved for considerable time after my intercourse with rest had ceased this was m de joinville who continued after his return from genoa show me much friendship he was fond seeing me conversing with me upon affairs italy follies m de montaigu whom he himself knew many anecdotes by means his acquaintance office for foreign affairs which he was much connected i had also pleasure seeing at my house my old comrade dupont who had purchased place province which he was whose affairs had brought him paris m de joinville became by degrees so desirous seeing me that he some measure laid me under constraint although our places residence were at great distance from each other we had friendly quarrel when i let week pass without going dine with him when he went joinville he was always desirous my accompanying him but having once been there pass week i had not least desire return m de joinville was certainly honest man even amiable certain respects but his understanding was beneath mediocrity he was handsome rather fond his person tolerably fatiguing he had one most singular collections perhaps world which he gave much his attention endeavored acquire it that his friends whom it sometimes afforded less amusement than it did himself this was complete collection songs court paris for upwards fifty years past which many anecdotes were be found that would have been sought for vain elsewhere these are memoirs for history france which would scarcely be thought any other country one day whilst we were still upon very best terms he received me so coldly manner so different from that which was customary him that after having given him opportunity explain even having begged him do it i left his house with resolution which i have persevered never return it again for i am seldom seen where i have been once ill received this case there was no diderot who pleaded for m de joinville i vainly endeavored discover what i had done offend him i could not recollect circumstance at which he could possibly have taken offence i was certain never having spoken him or his any other than most honorable manner for he had acquired my friendship besides my having nothing but favorable things say him my most inviolable maxim has been that never speaking but honorable manner houses i frequented at length by continually ruminating i formed following conjecture last time we had seen each other i had supped with him at apartment some girls his acquaintance company with two or three clerks office foreign affairs very amiable men who had neither manner nor appearance libertines on my part i can assert that whole evening passed making melancholy reflections on wretched fate creatures with whom we were i did not pay anything as m de joinville gave supper nor did i make girls least present because i gave them not opportunity i had done padoana establishing claim trifle i might have offered we all came away together cheerfully upon very good terms without having made second visit girls i went three or four days afterwards dine with m de joinville whom i had not seen during that interval who gave me reception which i have spoken unable suppose any other cause for it than some misunderstanding relative supper perceiving he had no inclination explain i resolved visit him no longer but i still continued send him my works he frequently sent me his compliments one evening meeting him green room french theatre he obligingly reproached me with not having called see him which however did not induce me depart from my resolution therefore this affair had rather appearance coolness than rupture however not having heard nor seen him since that time it would have been too late after absence several years renew my acquaintance with him it is for this reason m de joinville is not named my list although i had for considerable time frequented his house i will not swell my catalogue with names many other persons with whom i was or had become less intimate although i sometimes saw them country either at my own house or that some neighbor such for instance as abbes de condillac de malby mm de mairan de lalive de boisgelou vatelet ancelet others i will also pass lightly over that m de margency gentleman ordinary king ancient member coterie holbachique which he had quitted as well as myself old friend madam d epinay from whom he had separated as i had done i likewise consider that m desmahis his friend celebrated but short lived author comedy impertinent much same importance first was my neighbor country his estate at margency being near montmorency we were old acquaintances but neighborhood certain conformity experience connected us still more last died soon afterwards he had merit even wit but he was some degree original his comedy little coxcomb with women by whom he was not much regretted illustration 0178 i cannot however omit taking notice new correspondence i entered into at this period which has had too much influence over rest my life not make it necessary for me mark its origin person question is de lamoignon de malesherbes cour des aides then censor books which office he exercised with equal intelligence mildness great satisfaction men letters i had not once been see him at paris yet i had never received from him any other than most obliging condescensions relative censorship i knew that he had more than once very severely reprimanded persons who had written against me i had new proofs his goodness upon subject edition eloisa proofs so great work being very expensive from amsterdam by post he whom all letters were free permitted these be addressed him sent them me under countersign chancellor his father when work was printed he did not permit sale it kingdom until contrary my wishes edition had been sold for my benefit as profit this would on my part have been theft committed upon rey whom i had sold manuscript i not only refused accept present intended me without his consent which he very generously gave but persisted upon dividing with him hundred pistoles thousand livres forty pounds amount it but which he would not receive anything for these hundred pistoles i had mortification against which m de malesherbes had not guarded me seeing my work horribly mutilated sale good edition stopped until bad one was entirely disposed i have always considered m de malesherbes as man whose uprightness was proof against every temptation nothing that has happened has even made me doubt for moment his probity but as weak as he is polite he sometimes injures those he wishes serve by excess his zeal preserve them from evil he not only retrenched hundred pages edition paris but he made another retrenchment which no person but author could permit himself do copy good edition he sent madam de pompadour it is somewhere said that work that wife coal heaver is more respectable than mistress prince this phrase had occurred me warmth composition without any application reading over work i perceived it would be applied yet consequence very imprudent maxim i had adopted not suppressing anything on account application which might be made when my conscience bore witness me that i had not made them at time i wrote i determined not expunge phrase contented myself with substituting word prince king which i had first written this softening did not seem sufficient m de malesherbes he retrenched whole expression new sheet which he had printed on purpose stuck between other with as much exactness as possible copy madam de pompadour she was not ignorant this manoeuvre some good natured people took trouble inform her it for my part it was not until long time afterwards when i began feel consequences it that matter came my knowledge is not this origin concealed but implacable hatred another lady who was like situation without my knowing it or even being acquainted with her person when i wrote passage when book was published acquaintance was made i was very uneasy i mentioned this chevalier de lorenzy who laughed at me said lady was so little offended that she had not even taken notice matter i believed him perhaps rather too lightly made myself easy when there was much reason for my being otherwise at beginning winter i received additional mark goodness m de malesherbes which i was very sensible although i did not think proper take advantage it place was vacant journal des savans margency wrote me proposing me place as from himself but i easily perceived from manner letter that he was dictated authorized he afterwards told me he had been desired make me offer occupations this place were but trifling all i should have had do would have been make two abstracts month from books brought me for that purpose without being under necessity going once paris not even pay magistrate visit thanks by this employment i should have entered society men letters first merit m de mairan clairaut de guignes abbe barthelemi with first two whom i had already made acquaintance that two others was very desirable fine for this trifling employment duties which i might so commodiously have discharged there was salary eight hundred livres thirty three pounds i was for few hours undecided this from fear making margency angry displeasing m de malesherbes but at length insupportable constraint not having it my power work when i thought proper be commanded by time moreover certainty badly performing functions with which i was charge myself prevailed over everything determined me refuse place for which i was unfit i knew that my whole talent consisted certain warmth mind with respect subjects what i had treat that nothing but love that which was great beautiful sublime could animate my genius what would subjects extracts i should have had make from books or even books themselves have signified me my indifference about them would have frozen my pen stupefied my mind people thought i could make trade writing as most other men letters did instead which i never could write but from warmth imagination this certainly was not necessary for journal des savans i therefore wrote margency letter thanks politest terms possible so well explained him my reasons that it was not possible that either he or m de malesherbes could imagine there was pride or ill humor my refusal they both approved it without receiving me less politely secret was so well kept that it was never known public proposition did not come favorable moment i had some time before this formed project quitting literature especially trade author i had been disgusted with men letters by everything that had lately befallen me had learned from experience that it was impossible proceed same track without having some connections with them i was not much less dissatisfied with men world general with mixed life i had lately led half myself half devoted societies for which i was unfit i felt more than ever by constant experience that every unequal association is disadvantageous weaker person living with opulent people situation different from that i had chosen without keeping house as they did i was obliged imitate them many things little expenses which were nothing their fortunes were for me not less ruinous than indispensable another man country house friend is served by his own servant as well at table as his chamber he sends him seek for everything he wants having nothing directly do with servants house not even seeing them he gives them what he pleases when he thinks proper but i alone without servant was at mercy servants house whom it was necessary gain good graces that i might not have much suffer being treated as equal their master i was obliged treat them accordingly better than another would have done because fact i stood greater need their services this where there are but few domestics may be complied with but houses i frequented there were great number knaves so well understood their interests that they knew how make me want services them all successively women paris who have so much wit have no just idea this inconvenience their zeal economize my purse they ruined me if i supped town at any considerable distance from my lodgings instead permitting me send for hackney coach mistress house ordered her horses be put sent me home her carriage she was very glad save me twenty four sous shilling for fiacre but never thought half crown i gave her coachman footman if lady wrote me from paris hermitage or montmorency she regretted four sous two pence postage letter would have cost me sent it by one her servants who came sweating on foot whom i gave dinner half crown which he certainly had well earned if she proposed me pass with her week or fortnight at her country house she still said herself it will be saving poor man during that time his eating will cost him nothing she never recollected that i was whole time idle that expenses my family my rent linen clothes were still going on that i paid my barber double that it cost me more being her house than my own although i confined my little largesses house which i customarily lived that these were still ruinous me i am certain i have paid upwards twenty five crowns house madam d houdetot at raubonne where i never slept more than four or five times upwards thousand livres forty pounds as well at epinay as at chevrette during five or six years i was most assiduous there these expenses are inevitable man like me who knows not how provide anything for himself cannot support sight lackey who grumbles serves him with sour look with madam dupin even where i was one family whose house i rendered many services servants i never received theirs but for my money course time it was necessary renounce these little liberalities which my situation no longer permitted me bestow i felt still more severely inconvenience associating with people situation different from my own had this manner life been my taste i should have been consoled for heavy expense which i dedicated my pleasures but ruin myself at same time that i fatigued my mind was insupportable i had so felt weight this that profiting by interval liberty i then had i was determined perpetuate it entirely renounce great companies composition books all literary concerns for remainder my days confine myself narrow peaceful sphere which i felt i was born move produce this letter d alembert new elosia had little improved state my finances which had been considerably exhausted at hermitage emilius which after i had finished eloisa i had given great application was forwardness produce this could not be less than sum which i was already possession i intended place this money such manner as produce me little annual income which with my copying might be sufficient my wants without writing any more i had two other works upon stocks first these was my institutions politiques i examined state this work found it required several years labor i had not courage enough continue it wait until it was finished before i carried my intentions into execution therefore laying book aside i determined take from it all i could burn rest continuing this with zeal without interrupting emilius i finished contrat social dictionary music now remained this was mechanical might be taken up at any time object it was entirely pecuniary i reserved myself liberty laying it aside or finishing it at my ease according as my other resources collected should render this necessary or superfluous with respect morale sensitive which i had made nothing more than sketch i entirely gave it up as my last project if i found i could not entirely do without copying was that removing from paris where affluence my visitors rendered my housekeeping expensive deprived me time i should have turned advantage provide for it prevent my retirement state lassitude into which author is said fall when he has laid down his pen i reserved myself occupation which might fill up void my solitude without tempting me print anything more i know not for what reason they had long tormented me write memoirs my life although these were not until that time interesting as facts i felt they might become so by candor with which i was capable giving them i determined make these only work kind by unexampled veracity that for once at least world might see man such as he internally was i had always laughed at false ingenuousness montaigne who feigning confess his faults takes great care not give himself any except such as are amiable whilst i who have ever thought still think myself considering everything best men felt there is no human being however pure he may be who does not internally conceal some odious vice i knew i was described public very different from what i really was so opposite that notwithstanding my faults all which i was determined relate i could not but be gainer by showing myself my proper colors this besides not being be done without setting forth others also theirs work for same reason not being nature appear during my lifetime that several other persons i was more encouraged make my confession at which i should never have blush before any person i therefore resolved dedicate my leisure execution this undertaking immediately began collect such letters papers as might guide or assist my memory greatly regretting loss all i had burned mislaid destroyed project absolute retirement one most reasonable i had ever formed was strongly impressed upon my mind for execution it i was already taking measures when heaven which prepared me different destiny plunged me into another vortex montmorency ancient fine patrimony illustrious family that name was taken from it by confiscation it passed by sister duke henry house conde which has changed name montmorency that enguien duchy has no other castle than old tower where archives are kept which vassals come do homage but at montmorency or enguien there is private house built by crosat called le pauvre which having magnificence most superb chateaux deserves bears name castle majestic appearance this noble edifice view from it not equalled perhaps any country spacious saloon painted by hand master garden planted by celebrated le notre all combined form whole strikingly majestic which there is still simplicity that enforces admiration marechal duke de luxembourg who then inhabited this house came every year into neighborhood where formerly his ancestors were masters pass at least five or six weeks as private inhabitant but with splendor which did not degenerate from ancient lustre his family on first journey he made it after my residing at montmorency he his lady sent me valet de chambre with their compliments inviting me sup with them as often as it should be agreeable me at each time their coming they never failed reiterate same compliments invitation this called my recollection madam beuzenval sending me dine servants hall times were changed but i was still same man i did not choose be sent dine servants hall was but little desirous appearing at table great i should have been much better pleased had they left me as i was without caressing me rendering me ridiculous i answered politely respectfully monsieur madam de luxembourg but i did not accept their offers my indisposition timidity with my embarrassment speaking making me tremble at idea alone appearing assembly people court i did not even go castle pay visit thanks although i sufficiently comprehended this was all they desired that their eager politeness was rather matter curiosity than benevolence however advances still were made even became more pressing countess de boufflers who was very intimate with lady marechal sent inquire after my health beg i would go see her i returned her proper answer but did not stir from my house at journey easter year following 1759 chevalier de lorenzy who belonged court prince conti was intimate with madam de luxembourg came several times see me we became acquainted he pressed me go castle but i refused comply at length one afternoon when i least expected anything kind i saw coming up house marechal de luxembourg followed by five or six persons there was now no longer any means defence i could not without being arrogant unmannerly do otherwise than return this visit make my court madam la marechale from whom marechal had been bearer most obliging compliments me thus under unfortunate auspices began connections from which i could no longer preserve myself although too well founded foresight made me afraid them until they were made i was excessively afraid madam de luxembourg i knew she was amiable as manner i had seen her several times at theatre when she was duchess boufflers bloom her beauty but she was said be malignant this woman her rank made me tremble i had scarcely seen her before i was subjugated i thought her charming with that charm proof against time which had most powerful action upon my heart i expected find her conversation satirical full pleasantries points it was not so it was much better conversation madam de luxembourg is not remarkably full wit it has no sallies nor even finesse it is exquisitely delicate never striking but always pleasing her flattery is more intoxicating as it is natural it seems escape her involuntarily her heart overflow because it is too full i thought i perceived on my first visit that notwithstanding my awkward manner embarrassed expression i was not displeasing her all women court know how persuade us this when they please whether it be true or not but they do not all like madam de luxembourg possess art rendering that persuasion so agreeable that we are no longer disposed ever have doubt remaining from first day my confidence her would have been as full as it soon afterwards became had not duchess montmorency her daughter law young giddy malicious also taken it into her head attack me midst eulogiums her mamma feigned allurements on her own account made me suspect i was only considered by them as subject ridicule it would perhaps have been difficult relieve me from this fear with these two ladies had not extreme goodness marechal confirmed me belief that theirs was not real nothing is more surprising considering my timidity than promptitude with which i took him at his word on footing equality which he would absolutely reduce himself with me except it be that with which he took me at mine with respect absolute independence which i was determined live both persuaded i had reason be content with my situation that i was unwilling change it neither he nor madam de luxembourg seemed think moment my purse or fortune although i can have no doubt tender concern they had for me they never proposed me place nor offered me their interest except it were once when madam de luxembourg seemed wish me become member french academy i alleged my religion this she told me was no obstacle or if it was one she engaged remove it i answered that however great honor becoming member so illustrious body might be having refused m de tressan some measure king poland become member academy at nancy i could not with propriety enter into any other madam de luxembourg did not insist nothing more was said upon subject this simplicity intercourse with persons such rank who had power doing anything my favor m de luxembourg being highly deserving be particular friend king affords singular contrast with continual cares equally importunate officious friends protectors from whom i had just separated who endeavored less serve me than render me contemptible when marechal came see me at mont louis i was uneasy at receiving him his retinue my only chamber not because i was obliged make them all sit down midst my dirty plates broken pots but on account state floor which was rotten falling ruin i was afraid weight his attendants would entirely sink it less concerned on account my own danger than for that which affability marechal exposed him i hastened remove him from it by conducting him notwithstanding coldness weather my alcove which was quite open air had no chimney when he was there i told him my reason for having brought him it he told it his lady they both pressed me accept until floor was repaired lodging castle or if i preferred it separate edifice called little castle which was middle park this delightful abode deserves be spoken park or garden montmorency is not plain like that chevrette it is uneven mountainous raised by little hills valleys which able artist has taken advantage thereby varied his groves ornaments waters points view if i may so speak multiplied by art genius space itself rather narrow this park is terminated at top by terrace castle at bottom it forms narrow passage which opens becomes wider towards valley angle which is filled up with large piece water between orangery which is this widening piece water banks which are agreeably decorated stands little castle which i have spoken this edifice ground about it formerly belonged celebrated le brun who amused himself building decorating it exquisite taste architectual ornaments which that great painter had formed himself castle has since been rebuilt but still according plan design its first master it is little simple but elegant as it stands hollow between orangery large piece water consequently is liable be damp it is open middle by peristyle between two rows columns by which means air circulating throughout whole edifice keeps it dry notwithstanding its unfavorable situation when building is seen from opposite elevation which is point view it appears absolutely surrounded with water we imagine we have before our eyes enchanted island or most beautiful three boromeans called isola bella greater lake this solitary edifice i was offered choice four complete apartments it contains besides ground floor consisting dancing room billiard room kitchen i chose smallest over kitchen which also i had with it it was charmingly neat with blue white furniture this profound delicious solitude midst woods singing birds every kind perfume orange flowers i composed continual ecstasy fifth book emilius coloring which i owe great measure lively impression i received from place i inhabited with what eagerness did i run every morning at sunrise respire perfumed air peristyle what excellent coffee i took there tete tete with my theresa my cat dog were our company this retinue alone would have been sufficient for me during my whole life which i should not have had one weary moment i was there terrestrial paradise i lived innocence tasted happiness at journey july m madam de luxembourg showed me so much attention were so extremely kind that lodged their house overwhelmed with their goodness i could not do less than make them proper return assiduous respect near their persons i scarcely quitted them i went morning pay my court madam la marechale after dinner i walked with marechal but did not sup at castle on account numerous guests because they supped too late for me thus far everything was as it should be no harm would have been done could i have remained at this point but i have never known how preserve medium my attachments simply fulfil duties society i have ever been everything or nothing i was soon everything receiving most polite attention from persons highest rank i passed proper bounds conceived for them friendship not permitted except among equals these i had all familiarity my manners whilst they still preserved theirs same politeness which they had accustomed me yet i was never quite at my ease with madam de luxembourg although i was not quite relieved from my fears relative her character i apprehended less danger from it than from her wit it was by this especially that she impressed me with awe i knew she was difficult as conversation she had right be so i knew women especially those her rank would absolutely be amused that it was better offend than weary them i judged by her commentaries upon what people who went away had said what she must think my blunders i thought expedient spare me with her embarrassment speaking this was reading she had heard my eloisa knew it was press she expressed desire see work i offered read it her she accepted my offer i went her every morning at ten o clock m de luxembourg was present door was shut i read by side her bed so well proportioned my readings that there would have been sufficient for whole time she had stay had they even not been interrupted loss great battle which much afflicted king obliged m de luxembourg precipitately return court success this expedient surpassed my expectation madam de luxembourg took great liking julia author she spoke nothing but me thought nothing else said civil things me from morning till night embraced me ten times day she insisted on me always having my place by her side at table when any great lords wished it she told them it was mine made them sit down somewhere else impression these charming manners made upon me who was subjugated by least mark affection may easily be judged i became really attached her proportion attachment she showed me all my fear perceiving this infatuation feeling want agreeableness myself support it was that it would be changed into disgust unfortunately this fear was but too well founded there must have been natural opposition between her turn mind mine since independently numerous stupid things which at every instant escaped me conversation even my letters when i was upon best terms with her there were certain other things with which she was displeased without my being able imagine reason i will quote one instance from among twenty she knew i was writing for madam d houdetot copy new eloisa she was desirous have one on same footing this i promised her thereby making her one my customers i wrote her polite letter upon subject at least such was my intention her answer which was as follows stupefied me with surprise versailles tuesday i am ravished i am satisfied your letter has given me infinite pleasure i take earliest moment acquaint you with thank you for it these are exact words your letter although you are certainly very good customer i have some pain receiving your money according regular order i ought pay for pleasure i should have working for you i will say nothing more on subject i have complain your not speaking your state health nothing interests me more i love you with all my heart be assured that i write this you very melancholy mood for i should have much pleasure telling it you myself m de luxembourg loves embraces you with all his heart on receiving letter i hastened answer it reserving myself more fully examine matter protesting against all disobliging interpretation after having given several days this examination with inquietude which may easily be conceived still without being able discover what i could have erred what follows was my final answer on subject montmorency 8th december 1759 since my last letter i have examined hundred times passage question i have considered it its proper natural meaning as well as every other which may be given it i confess you madam that i know not whether it be i who owe you excuses or you from whom they are due me it is now ten years since these letters were written i have since that time frequently thought subject them such is still my stupidity that i have hitherto been unable discover what passages quoted from my letter she could find offensive or even displeasing i must here mention relative manuscript copy eloisa madam de luxembourg wished have what manner i thought give it some marked advantage which should distinguish it from all others i had written separately adventures lord edward had long been undetermined whether i should insert them wholly or extracts work which they seemed be wanting i at length determined retrench them entirely because not being manner rest they would have spoiled interesting simplicity which was its principal merit i had still stronger reason when i came know madam de luxembourg there was these adventures roman marchioness bad character some parts which without being applicable might have been applied her by those whom she was not particularly known i was therefore highly pleased with determination which i had come resolved abide by it but ardent desire enrich her copy with something which was not other what should i fall upon but these unfortunate adventures i concluded on making extract from them add work project dictated by madness which extravagance is inexplicable except by blind fatality which led me on destruction quos vult perdere jupiter dementet i was stupid enough make this extract with greatest care pains send it her as finest thing world it is true i at same time informed her original was burned which was really case that extract was for her alone would never be seen except by herself unless she chose show it which far from proving her my prudence discretion as it was my intention do clearly intimated what i thought application by which she might be offended my stupidity was such that i had no doubt her being delighted with what i had done she did not make me compliment upon it which i expected my great surprise never once mentioned paper i had sent her i was so satisfied with myself that it was not until long time afterwards i judged from other indications effect it had produced i had still favor her manuscript another idea more reasonable but which by more distant effects has not been much less prejudicial me so much does everything concur with work destiny when that hurries on man misfortune i thought ornamenting manuscript with engravings new eloisa which were same size i asked coindet for these engravings which belonged me by every kind title more so as i had given him produce plates which had considerable sale coindet is as cunning as i am contrary by frequently asking him for engravings he came knowledge use i intended make them he then under pretence adding some new ornament still kept them from me at length presented them himself ego versiculos feci tulit alter honores this gave him introduction upon certain footing hotel de luxembourg after my establishment at little castle he came rather frequently see me always morning especially when m madam de luxembourg were at montmorency therefore that i might pass day with him i did not go castle reproaches were made me on account my absence i told reason them i was desired bring with me m coindet i did so this was what he had sought after therefore thanks excessive goodness m madam de luxembourg had for me clerk m thelusson who was sometimes pleased give him his table when he had nobody else dine with him was suddenly placed at that marechal france with princes duchesses persons highest rank at court i shall never forget that one day being obliged return early paris marechal said after dinner company let us take walk upon road st denis we will accompany m coindet this was too much for poor man his head was quite turned for my part my heart was so affected that i could not say word i followed company weeping like child having strongest desire kiss foot good marechal but continuation history manuscript has made me anticipate i will go little back as far as my memory will permit mark each event its proper order as soon as little house mont louis was ready i had it neatly furnished again established myself there i could not break through resolution i had made on quitting hermitage always having my apartment myself but i found difficulty resolving quit little castle i kept key it being delighted with charming breakfasts peristyle frequently went castle sleep stayed three or four days as at country house i was at that time perhaps better more agreeably lodged than any private individual europe my host m mathas one best men world had left me absolute direction repairs at mont louis insisted upon my disposing his workmen without his interference i therefore found means making single chamber upon first story complete set apartments consisting chamber antechamber water closet upon ground floor was kitchen chamber theresa alcove served me for closet by means glazed partition chimney i had made there after my return this habitation i amused myself decorating terrace which was already shaded by two rows linden trees i added two others make cabinet verdure placed it table stone benches i surrounded it with lilies syringa woodbines had beautiful border flowers parallel with two rows trees this terrace more elevated than that castle from which view was at least as fine where i had tamed great number birds was my drawing room which i received m madam de luxembourg duke villeroy prince tingry marquis armentieres duchess montmorency duchess bouffiers countess valentinois countess boufflers other persons first rank who from castle disdained not make over very fatiguing mountain pilgrimage mont louis i owed all these visits favor m madam de luxembourg this i felt my heart on that account did them all due homage it was with same sentiment that i once said m de luxembourg embracing him ah monsieur le marechal i hated great before i knew you i have hated them still more since you have shown me with what ease they might acquire universal respect further than this i defy any person with whom i was then acquainted say i was ever dazzled for instant with splendor or that vapor incense i received ever affected my head that i was less uniform my manner less plain my dress less easy access people lowest rank less familiar with neighbors or less ready render service every person when i had it my power so do without ever once being discouraged by numerous frequently unreasonable importunities with which i was incessantly assailed although my heart led me castle montmorency by my sincere attachment those by whom it was inhabited it by same means drew me back neighborhood it there taste sweets equal simple life which my only happiness consisted theresa had contracted friendship with daughter one my neighbors mason name pilleu i did same with father after having dined at castle not without some constraint please madam de luxembourg with what eagerness did i return evening sup with good man pilleu his family sometimes at his own house at others at mine besides my two lodgings country i soon had third at hotel de luxembourg proprietors which pressed me so much go see them there that i consented notwithstanding my aversion paris where since my retiring hermitage i had been but twice upon two occasions which i have spoken i did not now go there except on days agreed upon solely supper next morning i returned country i entered came out by garden which faces boulevard so that i could with greatest truth say i had not set my foot upon stones paris midst this transient prosperity catastrophe which was be conclusion it was preparing at distance short time after my return mont louis i made there as it was customary against my inclination new acquaintance which makes another era my private history whether this be favorable or unfavorable reader will hereafter be able judge person with whom i became acquainted was marchioness verdelin my neighbor whose husband had just bought country house at soisy near montmorency mademoiselle d ars daughter comte d ars man fashion but poor had married m de verdelin old ugly deaf uncouth brutal jealous with gashes his face blind one eye but upon whole good man when properly managed possession fortune from fifteen twenty thousand year this charming object swearing roaring scolding storming making his wife cry all day long ended by doing whatever she thought proper this set her rage because she knew how persuade him that it was he who would she would not have it so m de margency whom i have spoken was friend madam became that monsieur he had few years before let them his castle margency near eaubonne andilly they resided there precisely at time my passion for madam d houdetot madam d houdetot madam de verdelin became acquainted with each other by means madam d aubeterre their common friend as garden margency was road by which madam d houdetot went mont olympe her favorite walk madam de verdelin gave her key that she might pass through it by means this key i crossed it several times with her but i did not like unexpected meetings when madam de verdelin was by chance upon our way i left them together without speaking her went on before this want gallantry must have made on her impression unfavorable me yet when she was at soisy she was anxious have my company she came several times see me at mont louis without finding me at home perceiving i did not return her visit took it into her head as means forcing me do it send me pots flowers for my terrace i was under necessity going thank her this was all she wanted we thus became acquainted this connection like every other i formed or was led into contrary my inclination began rather boisterously there never reigned it real calm turn mind madam de verdelinwas too opposite mine malignant expressions pointed sarcasms came from her with so much simplicity that continual attention too fatiguing for me was necessary perceive she was turning into ridicule person whom she spoke one trivial circumstance which occurs my recollection will be sufficient give idea her manner her brother had just obtained command frigate cruising against english i spoke manner fitting out this frigate without diminishing its swiftness sailing yes replied she most natural tone voice no more cannon are taken than are necessary for fighting i seldom have heard her speak well any her absent friends without letting slip something their prejudice what she did not see with evil eye she looked upon with one ridicule her friend margency was not excepted what i found most insupportable her was perpetual constraint proceeding from her little messages presents billets which it was labor for me answer i had continual embarrassments either thanking or refusing however by frequently seeing this lady i became attached her she had her troubles as well as i had mine reciprocal confidence rendered our conversations interesting nothing so cordially attaches two persons as satisfaction weeping together we sought company each other for our reciprocal consolation want this has frequently made me pass over many things i had been so severe my frankness with her that after having sometimes shown so little esteem for her character great deal was necessary be able believe she could sincerely forgive me following letter is specimen epistles i sometimes wrote her it is be remarked that she never once any her answers them seemed be least degree piqued montmorency 5th november 1760 you tell me madam you have not well explained yourself order make me understand i have explained myself ill you speak your pretended stupidity for purpose making me feel my own you boast being nothing more than good kind woman as if you were afraid being taken at your word you make me apologies tell me i owe them you yes madam i know it it is i who am fool good kind man if it be possible worse than all this it is i who make bad choice my expressions opinion fine french lady who pays as much attention words speaks as well as you do but consider that i take them common meaning language without knowing or troubling my head about polite acceptations which they are taken virtuous societies paris if my expressions are sometimes equivocal i endeavored by my conduct determine their meaning etc rest letter is much same coindet enterprising bold even effrontery who was upon watch after all my friends soon introduced himself my name house madam de verdelin unknown me shortly became there more familiar than myself this coindet was extraordinary man he presented himself my name houses all my acquaintance gained footing them ate there without ceremony transported with zeal do me service he never mentioned my name without his eyes being suffused with tears but when he came see me he kept most profound silence on subject all these connections especially on that which he knew i must be interested instead telling me what he had heard said or seen relative my affairs he waited for my speaking him even interrogated me he never knew anything what passed paris except that which i told him finally although everybody spoke me him he never once spoke me any person he was secret mysterious with his friend only but i will for present leave coindet madam de verdelin return them at proper time sometime after my return mont louis la tour painter came see me brought with him my portrait crayons which few years before he had exhibited at salon he wished give me this portrait which i did not choose accept but madam d epinay who had given me hers would have had this prevailed upon me ask him for it he had taken some time retouch features interval happened my rupture with madam d epinay i returned her her portrait giving her mine being no longer question i put it into my chamber castle m de luxembourg saw it there found it good one i offered it him he accepted it i sent it castle he his lady comprehended i should be very glad have theirs they had them taken miniature by very skilful hand set box rock crystal mounted with gold very handsome manner with which i was delighted made me present both madam de luxenbourg would never consent that her portrait should be on upper part box she had reproached me several times with loving m de luxembourg better than i did her i had not denied it because it was true by this manner placing her portrait she showed very politely but very clearly she had not forgotten preference much about this time i was guilty folly which did not contribute preserve me her good graces although i had no knowledge m de silhoutte was not much disposed like him i had great opinion his administration when he began let his hand fall rather heavily upon financiers i perceived he did not begin his operation favorable moment but he had my warmest wishes for his success as soon as i heard he was displaced i wrote him my intrepid heedless manner following letter which i certainly do not undertake justify montmorency 2d december 1759 vouchsafe sir receive homage solitary man who is not known you but who esteems you for your talents respects you for your administration who did you honor believe you would not long remain it unable save state except at expense capital by which it has been ruined you have braved clamors gainers money when i saw you crush these wretches i envied you your place at seeing you quit it without departing from your system i admire you be satisfied with yourself sir step you have taken will leave you honor you will long enjoy without competitor malediction knaves is glory honest man madam de luxembourg who knew i had written this letter spoke me it when she came into country at easter i showed it her she was desirous copy this i gave her but when i did it i did not know she was interested under farms displacing m de silhoutte by my numerous follies any person would have imagined i wilfully endeavored bring on myself hatred amiable woman who had power whom truth i daily became more attached was far from wishing occasion her displeasure although by my awkward manner proceeding i did everything proper for that purpose i think it superfluous remark here that it is her history opiate m tronchin which i have spoken first part my memoirs relates other lady was madam de mirepoix they have never mentioned me circumstance nor has either them least seemed have preserved remembrance it but presume that madam de luxembourg can possibly have forgotten it appears me very difficult would still remain so even were subsequent events entirely unknown for my part i fell into deceitful security relative effects my stupid mistakes by internal evidence my not having taken any step with intention offend as if woman could ever forgive what i had done although she might be certain will had not least part matter although she seemed not see or feel anything that i did not immediately find either her warmth friendship diminished or least change her manner continuation even increase too well founded foreboding made me incessantly tremble lest disgust should succeed infatuation was it possible for me expect lady such high rank constancy proof against my want address support it i was unable conceal from her this secret foreboding which made me uneasy rendered me still more disagreeable this will be judged by following letter which contains very singular prediction n b this letter without date my rough copy was written october 1760 at latest how cruel is your goodness why disturb peace solitary mortal who had renounced pleasures life that he might no longer suffer fatigues them i have passed my days vainly searching for solid attachments i have not been able form any ranks which i was equal is it yours that i ought seek for them neither ambition nor interest can tempt me i am not vain but little fearful i can resist everything except caresses why do you both attack me by weakness which i must overcome because distance by which we are separated over flowings susceptible hearts cannot bring mine near you will gratitude be sufficient for heart which knows not two manners bestowing its affections feels itself incapable everything except friendship friendship madam la marechale ah there is my misfortune it is good you marechal make use this expression but i am mad when i take you at your word you amuse yourselves i become attached end this prepares for me new regrets how i do hate all your titles pity you on account your being obliged bear them you seem me be so worthy tasting charms private life why do not you reside at clarens i would go there search happiness but castle montmorency hotel de luxembourg is it these places jean jacques ought be seen is it there friend equality ought carry affections sensible heart who thus paying esteem which he is held thinks he returns as much as he receives you are good susceptible also this i know have seen i am sorry i was not sooner convinced it but rank you hold manner living nothing can make lasting impression succession new objects efface each other so that not one them remains you will forget me madam after having made it impossible for me imitate you you have done great deal make me unhappy be inexcusable i joined with her marechal render compliment less severe for i was moreover so sure him that i never had doubt my mind continuation his friendship nothing that intimidated me madam la marechale ever for moment extended him i never have had least mistrust relative his character which i knew be feeble but constant i no more feared coldness on his part than i expected from him heroic attachment simplicity familiarity our manners with each other proved how far dependence was reciprocal we were both always right i shall ever honor hold dear memory this worthy man notwithstanding everything that was done detach him from me i am as certain his having died my friend as if i had been present his last moments at second journey montmorency year 1760 reading eloisa being finished i had recourse that emilius support myself good graces madam de luxembourg but this whether subject was less her taste or that so much reading at length fatigued her did not succeed so well however as she reproached me with suffering myself be dupe booksellers she wished me leave her care printing work that i might reap from it greater advantage i consented her doing it on express condition its not being printed france on which we had along dispute i affirming that it was impossible obtain even imprudent solicit tacit permission being unwilling permit impression upon any other terms kingdom she that censor could not make least difficulty according system government had adopted she found means make m de malesherbes enter into her views he wrote me on subject long letter with his own hand prove profession faith savoyard vicar be composition which must everywhere gain approbation its readers that court as things were then circumstanced i was surprised see this magistrate always so prudent become so smooth business as printing book was by that alone legal i had no longer any objection make that work yet by extraordinary scruple i still required it should be printed holland by bookseller neaulme whom not satisfied with indicating him i informed my wishes consenting edition should be brought out for profit french bookseller that as soon as it was ready it should be sold at paris or wherever else it might be thought proper as with this i had no manner concern this is exactly what was agreed upon between madam de luxembourg myself after which i gave her my manuscript madam de luxembourg was this time accompanied by her granddaughter mademoiselle de boufflers now duchess lauzun her name was amelia she was charming girl she really had maiden beauty mildness timidity nothing could be more lovely than her person nothing more chaste tender than sentiments she inspired she was besides still child under eleven years age madam de luxembourg who thought her too timid used every endeavor animate her she permitted me several times give her kiss which i did with my usual awkwardness instead saying flattering things her as any other person would have done i remained silent disconcerted i know not which two little girl or myself was most ashamed illustration 0202 i met her one day alone staircase little castle she had been see theresa with whom her governess still was not knowing what else say i proposed her kiss which innocence her heart she did not refuse having morning received one from me by order her grandmother her presence next day while reading emilius by side bed madam de luxembourg i came passage which i justly censure that which i had done preceding evening she thought reflection extremely just said some very sensible things upon subject which made me blush how was i enraged at my incredible stupidity which has frequently given me appearance guilt when i was nothing more than fool embarrassed stupidity which man known be endowed with some wit is considered as false excuse i can safely swear that this kiss as well as others heart thoughts mademoiselle amelia were not more pure than my own that if i could have avoided meeting her i should have done it not that i had not great pleasure seeing her but from embarrassment not finding word proper say whence comes it that even child can intimidate man whom power kings has never inspired with fear what is be done how without presence mind am i act if i strive speak persons i meet i certainly say some stupid thing them if i remain silent i am misanthrope unsociable animal bear total imbecility would have been more favorable me but talents which i have failed improve world have become instruments my destruction that talents i possessed at latter end this journey madam de luxembourg did good action which i had some share diderot having very imprudently offended princess robeck daughter m de luxembourg palissot whom she protected took up quarrel revenged her by comedy philosophers which i was ridiculed diderot very roughly handled author treated me with more gentleness less i am opinion on account obligation he was under me than from fear displeasing father his protectress by whom he knew i was beloved bookseller duchesne with whom i was not at that time acquainted sent me comedy when it was printed this i suspect was by order palissot who perhaps thought i should have pleasure seeing man with whom i was no longer connected defamed he was greatly deceived when i broke with diderot whom i thought less ill natured than weak indiscreet i still always preserved for his person attachment esteem even respect for our ancient friendship which i know was for long time as sincere on his part as on mine case was quite different with grimm man false by nature who never loved me who is not even capable friendship person who without least subject complaint solely satisfy his gloomy jealousy became under mask friendship my most cruel calumniator this man is me cipher other will always be my old friend my very bowels yearned at sight this odious piece reading it was insupportable me without going through whole i returned copy duchesne with following letter montmorency 21st may 1760 casting my eyes over piece you sent me i trembled at seeing myself well spoken it i do not accept horrid present i am persuaded that sending it me you did not intend insult but you do not know or have forgotten that i have honor be friend respectable man who is shamefully defamed calumniated this libel duchense showed letter diderot upon whom it ought have had effect quite contrary was vexed at it his pride could not forgive me superiority generous action i was informed his wife everywhere inveighed against me with bitterness with which i was not least affected as i knew she was known everybody be noisy babbler diderot his turn found avenger abbe morrellet who wrote against palissot little work imitated from petit prophete entitled vision this production he very imprudently offended madam de robeck whose friends got him sent bastile though she not naturally vindictive at that time dying state i am certain had nothing do with affair d alembert who was very intimately connected with morrellet wrote me letter desiring i would beg madam de luxembourg solicit his liberty promising her return encomiums encyclopedie my answer this letter was as follows i did not wait receipt your letter before i expressed madam de luxembourg pain confinement abbe morrellet gave me she knows my concern shall be made acquainted with yours her knowing that abbe is man merit will be sufficient make her interest herself his behalf however although she marechal honor me with benevolence which is my greatest consolation that name your friend be them recommendation favor abbe morrellet i know not how far on this occasion it may be proper for them employ credit attached rank they hold consideration due their persons i am not even convinced that vengeance question relates princess robeck so much as you seem imagine were this even case we must not suppose that pleasure vengeance belongs philosophers exclusively that when they choose become women women will become philosophers i will communicate you whatever madam de luxembourg may say me after having shown her your letter meantime i think i know her well enough assure you that should she have pleasure contributing enlargement abbe morrellet she will not accept tribute acknowledgment you promise her encyclopedie although she might think herself honored by it because she does not do good expectation praise but from dictates her heart i made every effort excite zeal commiseration madam de luxembourg favor poor captive succeeded my wishes she went versailles on purpose speak m de st florentin this journey shortened residence at montmorency which marechal was obliged quit at same time go rouen whither king sent him as governor normandy on account motions parliament which government wished keep within bounds madam de luxembourg wrote me following letter day after her departure versailles wednesday m de luxembourg set off yesterday morning at six o clock i do not yet know that i shall follow him i wait until he writes me as he is not yet certain stay it will be necessary for him make i have seen m de st florentin who is as favorably disposed as possible towards abbe morrellet but he finds some obstacles his wishes which however he is hopes removing first time he has do business with king which will be next week i have also desired as favor that he might not be exiled because this was intended he was be sent nancy this sir is what i have been able obtain but i promise you i will not let m de st florentin rest until affair is terminated manner you desire let me now express you how sorry i am on account my being obliged leave you so soon which i flatter myself you have not least doubt i love you with all my heart shall do so for my whole life few days afterwards i received following note from d alembert which gave me real joy august 1st thanks your cares my dear philosopher abbe has left bastile his imprisonment will have no other consequence he is setting off for country as well as myself returns you thousand thanks compliments vale et me ama abbe also wrote me few days afterwards letter thanks which did not my opinion seem breathe certain effusion heart which he seemed some measure extenuate service i had rendered him some time afterwards i found that he d alembert had certain degree i will not say supplanted but succeeded me good graces madam de luxembourg that i had lost them all they had gained however i am far from suspecting abbe morrellet having contributed my disgrace i have too much esteem for him harbor any such suspicion with respect d alembert i shall at present leave him out question hereafter say him what may seem necessary i had at same time another affair which occasioned last letter i wrote voltaire letter against which he vehemently exclaimed as abominable insult although he never showed it any person i will here supply want that which he refused do abbe trublet with whom i had slight acquaintance but whom i had but seldom seen wrote me on 13th june 1760 informing me that m formey his friend correspondent had printed his journal my letter voltaire upon disaster at lisbon abbe wished know how letter came be printed his jesuitical manner asked me my opinion without giving me his own on necessity reprinting it as i most sovereignly hate this kind artifice strategem i returned such thanks as were proper but manner so reserved as make him feel it although this did not prevent him from wheedling me two or three other letters until he had gathered all he wished know i clearly understood that not withstanding all trublet could say formey had not found letter printed that first impression it came from himself i knew him be impudent pilferer who without ceremony made himself revenue by works others although he had not yet had incredible effrontery take from book already published name author put his own place it sell book for his own profit this manner he afterwards appropriated himself emilius but by what means had this manuscript fallen into his hands that was question not easy resolve but by which i had weakness be embarrassed although voltaire was excessively honored by letter as fact notwithstanding his rude proceedings he would have had right complain had i had it printed without his consent i resolved write him upon subject second letter was as follows which he returned no answer giving greater scope his brutality he feigned be irritated fury montmorency 17th june 1760 i did not think sir i should ever have occasion correspond with you but learning letter i wrote you 1756 had been printed at berlin i owe you account my conduct that respect will fulfil this duty with truth simplicity letter having really been addressed you was not intended be printed i communicated contents it on certain conditions three persons whom right friendship did not permit me refuse anything kind whom same rights still less permitted abuse my confidence by betraying their promise these persons are madam de chenonceaux daughter law madam dupin comtesse d houdetot german name grimm madam de chenonceaux was desirous letter should be printed asked my consent i told her that depended upon yours this was asked you which you refused matter dropped however abbe trublet with whom i have not least connection has just written me from motive most polite attention that having received papers journal m formey he found them this same letter with advertisement dated on 23d october 1759 which editor states that he had few weeks before found it shops booksellers berlin as it is one those loose sheets which shortly disappear he thought proper give it place his journal this sir is all i know matter it is certain letter had not until lately been heard at paris it is also as certain that copy either manuscript or print fallen into hands m de formey could never have reached them except by your means which is not probable or those one three persons i have mentioned finally it is well known two ladies are incapable such perfidy i cannot my retirement learn more relative affair you have correspondence by means which you may if you think it worth trouble go back source verify fact same letter abbe trublet informs me that he keeps paper reserve will not lend it without my consent which most assuredly i will not give but it is possible this copy may not be only one paris i wish sir letter may not be printed there i will do all my power prevent this from happening but if i cannot succeed that timely perceiving it i can have preference i will not then hesitate have it immediately printed this me appears just natural with respect your answer same letter it has not been communicated anyone you may be assured it shall not be printed without your consent which i certainly shall not be indiscreet enough ask you well knowing that what one man writes another is not written public but should you choose write one you wish have published address it me i promise you faithfully add it my letter not make it single word reply i love you not sir you have done me your disciple enthusiastic admirer injuries which might have caused me most exquisite pain you have ruined geneva return for asylum it has afforded you you have alienated from me my fellow citizens return for eulogiums i made you amongst them it is you who render me residence my own country insupportable it is you who will oblige me die foreign land deprived all consolations usually administered dying person cause me instead receiving funeral rites be thrown dogs whilst all honors man can expect will accompany you my country finally i hate you because you have been desirous i should but i hate you as man more worthy loving you had you chosen it all sentiments with which my heart was penetrated for you admiration which cannot be refused your fine genius partiality your writings are those you have not effaced if i can honor nothing you except your talents fault is not mine i shall never be wanting respect due them nor that which this respect requires midst these little literary cavillings which still fortified my resolution i received greatest honor letters ever acquired me which i was most sensible two visits prince conti deigned make me one at little castle other at mont louis he chose time for both these when m de luxembourg was not at montmorency order render it more manifest that he came there solely on my account i have never had doubt my owing first condescensions this prince madam de luxembourg madam de boufflers but i am opinion i owe his own sentiments myself those with which he has since that time continually honored me remark perseverance this blind stupid confidence midst all treatment which should soonest have undeceived me it continued until my return paris 1770 my apartments at mont louis being small situation alcove charming i conducted prince it where complete condescension he was pleased show me he chose i should have honor playing with him game chess i knew he beat chevalier de lorenzy who played better than i did however notwithstanding signs grimace chevalier spectators which i feigned not see i won two games we played when they were ended i said him respectful but very grave manner my lord i honor your serene highness too much not beat you always at chess this great prince who had real wit sense knowledge so was worthy not be treated with mean adulation felt fact at least i think so that i was only person present who treated him like man i have every reason believe he was not displeased with me for it had this even been case i should not have reproached myself with having been unwilling deceive him anything i certainly cannot do it with having my heart made ill return for his goodness but solely with having sometimes done it with ill grace whilst he himself accompanied with infinite gracefulness manner which he showed me marks it few days afterwards he ordered hamper game be sent me which i received as i ought this little time was succeeded by another one his gamekeepers wrote me by order his highness that game it contained had been shot by prince himself i received this second hamper but i wrote madam de boufflers that i would not receive third this letter was generally blamed deservedly so refusing accept presents game from prince blood who moreover sends it so polite manner is less delicacy haughty man who wishes preserve his independence than rusticity clown who does not know himself i have never read this letter my collection without blushing reproaching myself for having written it but i have not undertaken my confession with intention concealing my faults that which i have just spoken is too shocking my own eyes suffer me pass it over silence if i were not guilty offence becoming his rival i was very near doing it for madam de boufflers was still his mistress i knew nothing matter she came rather frequently see me with chevalier de lorenzy she was yet young beautiful affected be whimsical my mind was always romantic which was much same nature i was near being laid hold i believe she perceived it chevalier saw it also at least he spoke me upon subject manner not discouraging but i was this time reasonable at age fifty it was time i should be so full doctrine i had just preached graybeards my letter d alembert i should have been ashamed not profiting by it myself besides coming knowledge that which i had been ignorant i must have been mad have carried my pretensions so far as expose myself such illustrious rivalry finally ill cured perhaps my passion for madam de houdetot i felt nothing could replace it my heart i bade adieu love for rest my life i have this moment just withstood dangerous allurements young woman who had her views if she feigned forget my twelve lustres i remember them after having thus withdrawn myself from danger i am no longer afraid fall i answer for myself for rest my days madam de boufflers perceiving emotion she caused me might also observe i had triumphed over it i am neither mad nor vain enough believe i was at my age capable inspiring her with same feelings but from certain words which she let drop theresa i thought i had inspired her with curiosity if this be case that she has not forgiven me disappointment she met with it must be confessed i was born be victim my weaknesses since triumphant love was so prejudicial me love triumphed over not less so here finishes collection letters which has served me as guide last two books my steps will future be directed by memory only but this is such nature relative period which i am now come strong impression objects has remained so perfectly upon my mind that lost immense sea my misfortunes i cannot forget detail my first shipwreck although consequences present me but confused remembrance i therefore shall be able proceed succeeding book with sufficient confidence if i go further it will be groping dark book xi although eloisa which for long time had been press did not yet at end year 1760 appear work already began make great noise madam de luxembourg had spoken it at court madam de houdetot at paris latter had obtained from me permission for saint lambert read manuscript king poland who had been delighted with it duclos whom i had also given perusal work had spoken it at academy all paris was impatient see novel booksellers rue saint jacques that palais royal were beset with people who came inquire when it was be published it was at length brought out success it had answered contrary custom impatience with which it had been expected dauphiness who was one first who read it spoke it m de luxembourg as ravishing performance opinions men letters differed from each other but those any other class approbation was general especially with women who became so intoxicated with book author that there was not one high life with whom i might not have succeeded had i undertaken do it this i have such proofs as i will not commit paper which without aid experience authorized my opinion it is singular that book should have succeeded better france than rest europe although french both men women are severely treated it contrary my expectation it was least successful switzerland most so paris do friendship love virtue reign this capital more than elsewhere certainly not but there reigns it exquisite sensibility which transports heart their image makes us cherish others pure tender virtuous sentiments we no longer possess corruption is everywhere same virtue morality no longer exist europe but if least love them still remains it is paris that this will be found i wrote this 1769 midst so many prejudices feigned passions real sentiments nature are not be distinguished from others unless we well know analyze human heart very nice discrimination not be acquired except by education world is necessary feel finesses heart if i dare use expression with which this work abounds i do not hesitate place fourth part it upon equality with princess cleves nor assert that had these two works been read nowhere but provinces their merit would never have been discovered it must not therefore be considered as matter astonishment that greatest success my work was at court it abounds with lively but veiled touches pencil which could not but give pleasure there because persons who frequent it are more accustomed than others discover them distinction must however be made work is by no means proper for species men wit who have nothing but cunning who possess no other kind discernment than that which penetrates evil see nothing where good only is be found if for instance eloisa had been published certain country i am convinced it would not have been read through by single person work would have been stifled its birth i have collected most letters written me on subject this publication deposited them tied up together hands madam de nadillac should this collection ever be given world very singular things will be seen opposition opinion which shows what it is have do with public thing least kept view which will ever distinguish it from every other work is simplicity subject continuation interest which confined three persons is kept up throughout six volumes without episode romantic adventure or anything malicious either persons or actions diderot complimented richardson on prodigious variety his portraits multiplicity his persons fact richardson has merit having well characterized them all but with respect their number he has that common with most insipid writers novels who attempt make up for sterility their ideas by multiplying persons adventures it is easy awaken attention by incessantly presenting unheard adventures new faces which pass before imagination as figures magic lanthorn do before eye but keep up that attention same objects without aid wonderful is certainly more difficult if everything else being equal simplicity subject adds beauty work novels richardson superior so many other respects cannot this be compared mine i know it is already forgotten cause its being so but it will be taken up again all my fear was that by extreme simplicity narrative would be fatiguing that it was not sufficiently interesting engage attention throughout whole i was relieved from this apprehension by circumstance which alone was more flattering my pride than all compliments made me upon work it appeared at beginning carnival hawker carried it princess talmont it was not princess but some other lady whose name i do not know on evening ball night at opera after supper princess dressed herself for ball until hour going there took up new novel at midnight she ordered horses be put into carriage continued read servant returned tell her horses were put she made no answer her people perceiving she forgot herself came tell her it was two o clock there is yet no hurry replied princess still reading on some time afterwards her watch having stopped she rang know hour she was told it was four o clock that being case she said it is too late go ball let horses be taken off she undressed herself passed rest night reading ever since i came knowledge this circumstance i have had constant desire see lady not only know from herself whether or not what i have related be exactly true but because i have always thought it impossible be interested so lively manner happiness julia without having that sixth moral sense with which so few hearts are endowed without which no person whatever can understand sentiments mine what rendered women so favorable me was their being persuaded that i had written my own history was myself hero romance this opinion was so firmly established that madam de polignac wrote madam de verdelin begging she would prevail upon me show her portrait julia everybody thought it was impossible so strongly express sentiments without having felt them or thus describe transports love unless immediately from feelings heart this was true i certainly wrote novel during time my imagination was inflamed ecstasy but they who thought real objects necessary this effect were deceived far from conceiving what degree i can at will produce it for imaginary beings without madam d houdetot recollection few circumstances my youth amours i have felt described would have been with fairy nymphs i was unwilling either confirm or destroy error which was advantageous me reader may see preface dialogue which i had printed separately what manner i left public suspense rigorous people say i ought have explicity declared truth for my part i see no reason for this nor anything that could oblige me it am opinion there would have been more folly than candor declaration without necessity much about same time paix perpetuelle made its appearance this i had year before given manuscript certain m de bastide author journal called le monde into which he would at all events cram all my manuscripts he was known m duclos came his name beg i would help him fill monde he had heard speak eloisa would have me put this into his journal he was also desirous making same use emilius he would have asked me for social contract for same purpose had he suspected it be written at length fatigued with his importunities i resolved upon letting him have paix perpetuelle which i gave him for twelve louis our agreement was that he should print it his journal but as soon as he became proprietor manuscript he thought proper print it separately with few retrenchments which censor required him make what would have happened had i joined work my opinion it which fortunately i did not communicate m de bastide nor was it comprehended our agreement this remains still manuscript amongst my papers if ever it be made public world will see how much pleasantries self sufficient manner m de voltaire on subject must have made me who was so well acquainted with short sightedness this poor man political matters which he took it into his head speak shake my sides with laughter midst my success with women public i felt i lost ground at hotel de luxembourg not with marechal whose goodness me seemed daily increase but with his lady since i had had nothing more read her door her apartment was not so frequently open me during her stay at montmorency although i regularly presented myself i seldom saw her except at table my place even there was not distinctly marked out as usual as she no longer offered me that by her side spoke me but seldom not having on my part much say her i was well satisfied with another where i was more at my ease especially evening for i mechanically contracted habit placing myself nearer nearer marechal apropos evening i recollect having said i did not sup at castle this was true at beginning my acquaintance there but as m de luxembourg did not dine nor even sit down table it happened that i was for several months already very familiar family without ever having eaten with him this he had goodness remark upon which i determined sup there from time time when company was not numerous i did so found suppers very agreeable as dinners were taken almost standing whereas former were long everybody remaining seated with pleasure after long walk very good agreeable because m de luxembourg loved good eating honors them were done charming manner by madam de marechale without this explanation it would be difficult understand end letter from m de luxembourg which he says he recollects our walks with greatest pleasure especially adds he when evening we entered court did not find there traces carriages rake being every morning drawn over gravel efface marks left by coach wheels i judged by number ruts that persons who had arrived afternoon this year 1761 completed heavy losses this good man had suffered since i had had honor being known him as if it had been ordained that evils prepared for me by destiny should begin by man whom i was most attached who was most worthy esteem first year he lost his sister duchess villeroy second his daughter princess robeck third he lost duke montmorency his only son comte de luxembourg his grandson last two supporters branch which he was his name he supported all these losses with apparent courage but his heart incessantly bled secret during rest his life his health was ever after upon decline unexpected tragical death his son must have afflicted him more as it happened immediately after king had granted him for his child given him promise for his grandson reversion commission he himself then held captain gardes de corps he had mortification see last most promising young man perish by degrees from blind confidence mother physician who giving unhappy youth medicines for food suffered him die inanition alas had my advice been taken grandfather grandson would both still have been alive what did not i say write marechal what remonstrances did i make madam de montmorency upon more than severe regimen which upon faith physicians she made her son observe madam de luxembourg who thought as i did would not usurp authority mother m de luxembourg man mild easy character did not like contradict her madam de montmorency had borden confidence which her son at length became victim how delighted was poor creature when he could obtain permission come mont louis with madam de boufflers ask theresa for some victuals for his famished stomach how did i secretly deplore miseries greatness seeing this only heir immense fortune great name so many dignified titles devour with greediness beggar wretched morsel bread at length notwithstanding all i could say do physician triumphed child died hunger same confidence quacks which destroyed grandson hastened dissolution grandfather this he added pusillanimity wishing dissimulate infirmities age m de luxembourg had at intervals pain great toe he was seized with it at montmorency which deprived him sleep brought on slight fever i had courage enough pronounce word gout madam de luxembourg gave me reprimand surgeon valet de chambre marechal maintained it was not gout dressed suffering part with beaume tranquille unfortunately pain subsided when it returned same remedy was had recourse constitution marechal was weakened his disorder increased as did his remedies same proportion madam de luxembourg who at length perceived primary disorder be gout objected dangerous manner treating it things were afterwards concealed from her m de luxembourg few years lost his life consequence his obstinate adherence what he imagined be method cure but let me not anticipate misfortune how many others have i relate before i come this it is singular with what fatality everything i could say do seemed nature displease madam de luxembourg even when i had it most at heart preserve her friendship repeated afflictions which fell upon m de luxembourg still attached me him more consequently madam de luxembourg for they always seemed me be so sincerely united that sentiments favor one necessarily extended other marechal grew old his assiduity at court cares this brought on continually hunting fatigue especially that service during quarter he was waiting required vigor young man i did not perceive anything that could support his that course life since besides after his death his dignities were be dispersed his name extinct it was by no means necessary for him continue laborious life which principal object had been dispose prince favorably his children one day when we three were together he complained fatigues court as man who had been discouraged by his losses i took liberty speak retirement give him advice cyneas gave pyrrhus he sighed returned no positive answer but moment madam de luxembourg found me alone she reprimanded me severely for what i had said at which she seemed be alarmed she made remark which i so strongly felt justness that i determined never again touch upon subject this was that long habit living at court made that life necessary that it was become matter amusement for m de luxembourg that retirement i proposed him would be less relaxation from care than exile which inactivity weariness melancholy would soon put end his existence although she must have perceived i was convinced ought have relied upon promise i made her which i faithfully kept she still seemed doubt it i recollect that conversations i afterwards had with marechal were less frequent almost always interrupted whilst my stupidity awkwardness injured me her opinion persons whom she frequently saw most loved were far from being disposed aid me gaining what i had lost abbe de boufflers especially young man as lofty as it was possible for man be never seemed well disposed towards me besides his being only person society madam de luxembourg who never showed me least attention i thought i perceived i lost something with her every time he came castle it is true that without his wishing this be case his presence alone was sufficient produce effect so much did his graceful elegant manner render still more dull my stupid propositi during first two years he seldom came montmorency by indulgence madam de luxembourg i had tolerably supported myself but as soon as his visits began be regular i was irretrievably lost i wished take refuge under his wing gain his friendship but same awkwardness which made it necessary i should please him prevented me from succeeding attempt i made do it what i did with that intention entirely lost me with madam de luxembourg without being least service me with abbe with his understanding he might have succeeded anything but impossibility applying himself his turn for dissipation prevented his acquiring perfect knowledge any subject his talents are however various this is sufficient for circles which he wishes distinguish himself he writes light poetry fashionable letters strums on cithern pretends draw with crayon he took it into his head attempt portrait madam de luxembourg sketch he produced was horrid she said it did not least resemble her this was true traitorous abbe consulted me i like fool liar said there was likeness i wished flatter abbe but i did not please lady who noted down what i had said abbe having obtained what he wanted laughed at me his turn i perceived by ill success this my late beginning necessity making another attempt flatter invita minerva my talent was that telling men useful but severe truths with energy courage this it was necessary confine myself not only i was not born flatter but i knew not how commend awkwardness manner which i have sometimes bestowed eulogium has done me more harm than severity my censure this i have adduce one terrible instance consequences which have not only fixed my fate for rest my life but will perhaps decide on my reputation throughout all posterity during residence m de luxembourg at montmorency m de choiseul sometimes came supper at castle he arrived there one day after i had left it my name was mentioned m de luxembourg related him what had happened at venice between me m de montaigu m de choiseul said it was pity i had quitted that track that if i chose enter it again he would most willingly give me employment m de luxembourg told me what had passed this i was more sensible as i was not accustomed be spoiled by ministers had i been better state health it is not certain that i should not have been guilty new folly ambition never had power over my mind except during short intervals which every other passion left me at liberty but one these intervals would have been sufficient determine me this good intention m de choiseul gained him my attachment increased esteem which consequence some operations his administration i had conceived for his talents family compact particular had appeared me evince statesman first order he moreover gained ground my estimation by little respect i entertained for his predecessors not even excepting madam de pompadour whom i considered as species prime minister when it was reported that one these two would expel other i thought i offered up prayers for honor france when i wished that m de choiseul might triumph i had always felt antipathy madam de pompadour even before her preferment i had seen her with madam de la popliniere when her name was still madam d etioles i was afterwards dissatisfied with her silence on subject diderot with her proceedings relative myself as well on subject muses galantes as on that devin du village which had not any manner produced me advantages proportioned its success on all occasions i had found her but little disposed serve me this however did not prevent chevalier de lorenzy from proposing me write something praise that lady insinuating that i might acquire some advantage by it proposition excited my indignation more as i perceived it did not come from himself knowing that passive as he was he thought acted according impulsion he received i am so little accustomed constraint that it was impossible for me conceal from him my disdain nor from anybody moderate opinion i had favorite this i am sure she knew thus my own interest was added my natural inclination wishes i formed for m de choiseul having great esteem for his talents which was all i knew him full gratitude for his kind intentions moreover unacquainted my retirement with his taste manner living i already considered him as avenger public myself being at that time writing conclusion my social contract i stated it single passage what i thought preceding ministers him by whom they began be eclipsed on this occasion i acted contrary my most constant maxim besides i did not recollect that bestowing praise strongly censuring same article without naming persons language must be so appropriated those whom it is applicable that most ticklish pride cannot find it least thing equivocal i was this respect such imprudent security that i never once thought it was possible any one should make false application it will soon appear whether or not i was right one my misfortunes was always be connected with some female author this i thought i might avoid amongst great i was deceived it still pursued me madam de luxembourg was not however at least that i know attacked with mania writing but madam de boufflers was she wrote tragedy prose which first place was read handed about highly spoken society prince conti upon which not satisfied with encomiums she received she would absolutely consult me for purpose having mine this she obtained but with that moderation which work deserved she besides had with it information i thought it my duty give her that her piece entitled l esclave genereux greatly resembled english tragedy oroonoko but little known france although translated into french language madam de bouffiers thanked me for remark but however assured me there was not least resemblance between her piece other i never spoke plagiarisms except herself i did it discharge duty she had imposed on me but this has not since prevented me from frequently recollecting consequences sincerity gil blas preaching archbishop besides abbe de bouffiers by whom i was not beloved madam de bouffiers whose opinion i was guilty that which neither women nor authors ever pardon other friends madam de luxembourg never seemed much disposed become mine particularly president henault who enrolled amongst authors was not exempt from their weaknesses also madam du deffand mademoiselle de lespinasse both intimate with voltaire friends d alembert with whom latter at length lived however upon honorable footing for it cannot be understood i mean otherwise i first began interest myself for madam du deffand whom loss her eyes made object commiseration mine but her manner living so contrary my own that her hour going bed was almost mine for rising her unbounded passion for low wit importance she gave every kind printed trash either complimentary or abusive despotism transports her oracles her excessive admiration or dislike everything which did not permit her speak upon any subject without convulsions her inconceivable prejudices invincible obstinacy enthusiasm folly which this carried her her passionate judgments all disgusted me diminished attention i wished pay her i neglected her she perceived it this was enough set her rage although i was sufficiently aware how much woman her character was be feared i preferred exposing myself scourge her hatred rather than that her friendship my having so few friends society madam de luxembourg would not have been least dangerous had i had no enemies family these i had but one who my then situation was as powerful as hundred it certainly was not m de villeroy her brother for he not only came see me but had several times invited me villeroy as i had answered invitation with all possible politeness respect he had taken my vague manner doing it as consent arranged with madam de luxembourg journey fortnight which it was proposed me make one party as cares my health then required did not permit me go from home without risk i prayed madam de luxembourg have goodness make my apologies her answer proves this was done with all possible ease m de villeroy still continued show me his usual marks goodness his nephew heir young marquis villeroy had not for me same benevolence nor had i for him respect i had for his uncle his harebrained manner rendered him insupportable me my coldness drew upon me his aversion he insultingly attacked me one evening at table i had worst it because i am fool without presence mind because anger instead rendering my wit more poignant deprives me little i have i had dog which had been given me when he was quite young soon after my arrival at hermitage which i had called duke this dog not handsome but rare his kind which i had made my companion friend title which he certainly merited much more than most persons by whom it was taken became great request at castle montmorency for his good nature fondness attachment we had for each other but from foolish pusillanimity i had changed his name turk as if there were not many dogs called marquis without giving least offence any marquis whatsoever marquis villeroy who knew change name attacked me such manner that i was obliged openly at table relate what i had done whatever there might be offensive name duke it was not my having given but my having taken it away worst it all was there were many dukes present amongst others m de luxembourg his son marquis de villeroy who was one day have now has title enjoyed most cruel manner embarrassment into which he had thrown me i was told next day his aunt had severely reprimanded him it may be judged whether or not supposing her have been serious this put me upon better terms with him enable me support his enmity i had no person neither at hotel de luxembourg nor at temple except chevalier de lorenzy who professed himself my friend but he was more that d alembert under whose protection he passed with women for great geometrician he was moreover cicisbeo or rather complaisant chevalier countess boufflers great friend also d alembert chevalier de lorenzy was most passive instrument her hands thus far from having that circle any counter balance my inaptitude keep me good graces madam de luxembourg everybody who approached her seemed concur injuring me her good opinion yet besides emilius with which she charged herself she gave me at same time another mark her benevolence which made me imagine that although wearied with my conversation she would still preserve for me friendship she had so many times promised me for life as soon as i thought i could depend upon this i began ease my heart by confessing her all my faults having made it inviolable maxim show myself my friends such as i really was neither better nor worse i had declared her my connection with theresa everything that had resulted from it without concealing manner which i had disposed my children she had received my confessions favorably even too much so since she spared me censures i so much merited what made greatest impression upon me was her goodness theresa making her presents sending for her begging her come see her receiving her with caresses often embracing her public this poor girl was transports joy gratitude which i certainly partook friendship madam de luxembourg showed me her condescensions theresa affected me much more than if they had been made immediately myself things remained this state for considerable time but at length madam de luxembourg carried her goodness so far as have desire take one my children from hospital she knew i had put cipher into swaddling clothes eldest she asked me for counterpart cipher i gave it her this research she employed la roche her valet de chambre confidential servant who made vain inquiries although after only about twelve or fourteen years had registers foundling hospital been order or search properly made original cipher ought have been found however this may be i was less sorry for his want success than i should have been had i from time time continued see child from its birth until that moment if by aid indications given another child had been presented as my own doubt its being so fact fear having one thus substituted for it would have contracted my affections i should not have tasted charm real sentiment nature this during infancy stands need being supported by habit long absence child whom father has seen but for instant weakens at length annihilates paternal sentiment parents will never love child sent nurse like that which is brought up under their eyes this reflection may extenuate my faults their effects but it must aggravate them their source it may not perhaps be useless remark that by means theresa same la roche became acquainted with madam le vasseur whom grimm still kept at deuil near la chevrette not far from montmorency after my departure it was by means la roche that i continued send this woman money i had constantly sent her at stated times i am opinion he often carried her presents from madam de luxembourg therefore she certainly was not be pitied although she constantly complained with respect grimm as i am not fond speaking persons whom i ought hate i never mentioned his name madam de luxembourg except when i could not avoid it but she frequently made him subject conversation without telling me what she thought man or letting me discover whether or not he was her acquaintance reserve with people i love who are open with me being contrary my nature especially things relating themselves i have since that time frequently thought that madam de luxembourg but never except when other events rendered recollection natural having waited long time without hearing speak emilius after i had given it madam de luxembourg i at last heard agreement was made at paris with bookseller duchesne by him with neaulme amsterdam madam de luxembourg sent me original duplicate my agreement with duchesne that i might sign them i discovered writing be by same hand as that letters m de malesherbes which he himself did not write certainty that my agreement was made by consent under eye that magistrate made me sign without hesitation duchesne gave me for manuscript six thousand livres two hundred fifty pounds half specie one or two hundred copies after having signed two parts i sent them both madam de luxembourg according her desire she gave one duchesne instead returning other kept it herself so that i never saw it afterwards my acquaintance with m madam de luxembourg though it diverted me little from my plan retirement did not make me entirely renounce it even at time i was most favor with madam de luxembourg i always felt that nothing but my sincere attachment marechal herself could render me supportable people with whom they were connected all difficulty i had was conciliating this attachment with manner life more agreeable my inclination less contrary my health which constraint late suppers continually deranged notwithstanding all care taken prevent it for this as everything else attention was carried as far as possible thus for instance every evening after supper marechal who went early bed never failed notwithstanding everything that could be said contrary make me withdraw at same time it was not until some little time before my catastrophe that for what reason i know not he ceased pay me that attention before i perceived coolness madam de luxembourg i was desirous that i might not expose myself it execute my old project but not having means that effect i was obliged wait for conclusion agreement for emilius time i finished social contract sent it rey fixing price manuscript at thousand livres forty one pounds which he paid me i ought not perhaps omit trifling circumstance relative this manuscript i gave it well sealed up du voisin minister pays de vaud chaplain at hotel de hollande who sometimes came see me took upon himself send packet rey with whom he was connected manuscript written small letter was but very trifling did not fill his pocket yet passing barriere packet fell i know not by what means into hands commis who opened examined it afterwards returned it him when he had reclaimed it name ambassador this gave him opportunity reading it himself which he ingeniously wrote me he had done speaking highly work without suffering word criticism or censure escape him undoubtedly reserving himself become avenger christianity as soon as work should appear he resealed packet sent it rey such is substance his narrative letter which he gave account affair is all i ever knew matter besides these two books my dictionary music at which i still did something as opportunity offered i had other works less importance ready make their appearance which i proposed publish either separately or my general collection should i ever undertake it principal these works most which are still manuscript hands de peyrou was essay on origin languages which i had read m de malesherbes chevalier de lorenzy who spoke favorably it i expected all productions together would produce me net capital from eight ten thousand livres three four hundred pounds which i intended sink annuities for my life that theresa after which our design as i have already mentioned was go live together midst some province without further troubling public about me or myself with any other project than that peacefully ending my days still continuing do my neighborhood all good my power write at leisure memoirs which i intended such was my intention execution it was facilitated by act generosity rey upon which i cannot be silent this bookseller whom so many unfavorable things were told me paris is notwithstanding only one with whom i have always had reason be satisfied it is true we frequently disagreed as execution my works he was heedless i was choleric but matters interest which related them although i never made with him agreement form i always found him great exactness probity he is also only person his profession who frankly confessed me he gained largely by my means he frequently when he offered me part his fortune told me i was author it all not finding means exercising his gratitude immediately upon myself he wished at least give me proofs it person my governante upon whom he settled annuity three hundred livres twelve pounds expressing deed that it was acknowledgment for advantages i had procured him this he did between himself me without ostentation pretension or noise had not i spoken it anybody not single person would ever have known anything matter i was so pleased with this action that i became attached rey conceived for him real friendship sometime afterwards he desired i would become godfather one his children i consented part my regret situation which i am reduced is my being deprived means rendering future my attachment my goddaughter useful her her parents why am i who am so sensible modest generosity this bookseller so little so noisy eagerness many persons highest rank who pompously fill world with accounts services they say they wished render me but good effects which i never felt is it their fault or mine are they nothing more than vain is my insensibility purely ingratitude intelligent reader weigh determine for my part i say no more this pension was great resource theresa considerable alleviation me although i was far from receiving from it direct advantage any more than from presents that were made her she herself has always disposed everything when i kept her money i gave her faithful account it without ever applying any part deposit our common expenses not even when she was richer than myself what is mine is ours said i her what is thine is thine i never departed from this maxim they who have had baseness accuse me receiving by her hands that which i refused take with mine undoubtedly judged my heart by their own knew but little me i would willingly eat with her bread she should have earned but not that she should have had given her for proof this i appeal herself both now hereafter when according course nature she shall have survived me unfortunately she understands but little economy any respect is besides careless extravagant not from vanity nor gluttony but solely from negligence no creature is perfect here below since excellent qualities must be accompanied with some defects i prefer these vices although her defects are more prejudicial us both efforts i have made as formerly i did for mamma accumulate something advance which might some day be her never failing resource are not be conceived but my cares were always ineffectual neither these women ever called themselves account notwithstanding all my efforts everything i acquired was dissipated as fast as it came notwithstanding great simplicity theresa s dress pension from rey has never been sufficient buy her clothes i have every year been under necessity adding something it for that purpose we are neither us born be rich this i certainly do not reckon amongst our misfortunes social contract was soon printed this was not case with emilius for publication which i waited go into retirement i meditated duchesne from time time sent me specimens impression choose from when i had made my choice instead beginning he sent me others when at length we were fully determined on size letter several sheets were already printed off on some trifling alteration i made proof he began whole again at end six months we were less forwardness than on first day during all these experiments i clearly perceived work was printing france as well as holland that two editions it were preparing at same time what could i do manuscript was no longer mine far from having anything do with edition france i was always against it but since at length this was preparing spite all opposition was serve as model other it was necessary i should cast my eyes over it examine proofs that my work might not be mutilated it was besides printed so much by consent magistrate that it was he who some measure directed undertaking he likewise wrote me frequently once came see me converse on subject upon occasion which i am going speak whilst duchesne crept like snail neaulme whom he withheld scarcely moved at all sheets were not regularly sent him as they were printed he thought there was some trick manoeuvre duchesne that is guy who acted for him perceiving terms agreement be departed from he wrote me letter after letter full complaints it was less possible for me remove subject them than that those i myself had make his friend guerin who at that time came frequently see my house never ceased speaking me about work but always with greatest reserve he knew he did not know that it was printing france that magistrate had hand it expressing his concern for my embarrassment he seemed accuse me imprudence without ever saying what this consisted he incessantly equivocated seemed speak for no other purpose than hear what i had say i thought myself so secure that i laughed at his mystery circumspection as at habit he had contracted with ministers magistrates whose offices he much frequented certain having conformed every rule with work strongly persuaded that i had not only consent protection magistrate but that book merited had obtained favor minister i congratulated myself upon my courage doing good laughed at my pusillanimous friends who seemed uneasy on my account duclos was one these i confess my confidence his understanding uprightness might have alarmed me had i had less utility work probity those by whom it was patronized he came from house m baille see me whilst emilius was press he spoke me concerning it i read him profession faith savoyard vicar which he listened attentively as it seemed me with pleasure when i had finished he said what citizen this is part work now printing paris yes answered i it ought be printed at louvre by order king i confess it replied he but pray do not mention anybody your having read me this fragment this striking manner expressing himself surprised without alarming me i knew duclos was intimate with m de malesherbes i could not conceive how it was possible he should think so differently from him upon same subject i had lived at montmorency for last four years without ever having had there one day good health although air is excellent water is bad this may possibly be one causes which contributed increase my habitual complaints towards end autumn 1767 i fell quite ill passed whole winter suffering almost without intermission physical ill augmented by thousand inquietudes rendered these terrible for some time past my mind had been disturbed by melancholy forebodings without my knowing what these directly tended i received anonymous letters extraordinary nature others that were signed much same import i received one from counsellor parliament paris who dissatisfied with present constitution things foreseeing nothing but disagreeable events consulted me upon choice asylum at geneva or switzerland retire with his family another was brought me from m de president mortier parliament who proposed me draw up for this parliament which was then at variance with court memoirs remonstrances offering furnish me with all documents materials necessary for that purpose when i suffer i am subject ill humor this was case when i received these letters my answers them which i flatly refused everything that was asked me bore strong marks effect they had had upon my mind i do not however reproach myself with this refusal as letters might be so many snares laid by my enemies what was required me was contrary principles from which i was less willing than ever swerve but having it within my power refuse with politeness i did it with rudeness this consists my error i knew for instance president de be connected with encyclopedists holbachiens two letters which i have just spoken will be found amongst my papers letter from chancellor did not absolutely surprise me because i agreed with him opinion with many others that declining constitution france threatened approaching destruction disasters unsuccessful war all which proceeded from fault government incredible confusion finances perpetual drawings upon treasury by administration which was then divided between two or three ministers amongst whom reigned nothing but discord who counteract operations each other let kingdom go ruin discontent people every other rank subjects obstinacy woman who constantly sacrificing her judgment if she indeed possessed any her inclinations kept from public employment persons capable discharging duties them place them such as pleased her best everything occurred justifying foresight counsellor that public my own this made me several times consider whether or not i myself should seek asylum out kingdom before it was torn by dissensions by which it seemed be threatened but relieved from my fears by my insignificance peacefulness my disposition i thought that state solitude which i was determined live no public commotion could reach me i was sorry only that this state things m de luxembourg should accept commissions which tended injure him opinion persons place which he was governor i could have wished he had prepared himself retreat there case great machine had fallen pieces which seemed much be apprehended still appears me beyond doubt that if reins government had not fallen into single hand french monarchy would now be at last gasp whilst my situation became worse printing emilius went on more slowly was at length suspended without my being able learn reason why guy did not deign answer my letter inquiry i could obtain no information from any person what was going forward m de malesherbes being then country misfortune never makes me uneasy provided i know what it consists but it is my nature be afraid darkness i tremble at appearance it mystery always gives me inquietude it is too opposite my natural disposition which there is openness bordering on imprudence sight most hideous monster would i am opinion alarm me but little but if by night i were see figure white sheet i should be afraid it my imagination wrought upon by this long silence was now employed creating phantoms i tormented myself more endeavoring discover impediment printing my last best production as i had publication it much at heart as i always carried everything extreme i imagined that i perceived suspension suppression work yet being unable discover either cause or manner it i remained most cruel state suspense i wrote letter after letter guy m de malesherbes madam de luxembourg not receiving answers at least when i expected them my head became so affected that i was not far from delirium i unfortunately heard that father griffet jesuit had spoken emilius repeated from it some passages my imagination instantly unveiled me mystery iniquity i saw whole progress it as clearly as if it had been revealed me i figured myself that jesuits furious on account contemptuous manner which i had spoken colleges were possession my work that it was they who had delayed publication that informed by their friend guerin my situation foreseeing my approaching dissolution which i myself had no manner doubt they wished delay appearance work until after that event with intention curtail mutilate it favor their own views attribute me sentiments not my own number facts circumstances which occurred my mind confirmation this silly proposition gave it appearance truth supported by evidence demonstration is astonishing i knew guerin be entirely interest jesuits i attributed them all friendly advances he had made me i was persuaded he had by their entreaties pressed me engage with neaulme who had given them first sheets my work that they had afterwards found means stop printing it by duchesne perhaps get possession manuscript make such alterations it as they should think proper that after my death they might publish it disguised their own manner i had always perceived notwithstanding wheedling father berthier that jesuits did not like me not only as encyclopedist but because all my principles were more opposition their maxims influence than incredulity my colleagues since atheistical devout fanaticism approaching each other by their common enmity toleration may become united proof which is seen china cabal against myself whereas religion both reasonable moral taking away all power over conscience deprives those who assume that power every resource i knew chancellor was great friend jesuits i had my fears less son intimidated by father should find himself under necessity abandoning work he had protected i besides imagined that i perceived this be case chicanery employed against me relative first two volumes which alterations were required for reasons which i could not feel force whilst other two volumes were known contain things such nature as had censor objected them manner he did passages he thought exceptionable others would have required their being entirely written over again i also understood m de malesherbes himself told me it that abbe de grave whom he had charged with inspection this edition was another partisan jesuits i saw nothing but jesuits without considering that upon point being suppressed wholly taken up making their defence they had something which interested them much more than cavillings relative work which they were not question i am wrong however saying this did not occur me for i really thought it m de malesherbes took care make observation me moment he heard my extravagant suspicions but by another those absurdities man who from bosom obscurity will absolutely judge secret great affairs with which he is totally unacquainted i never could bring myself believe jesuits were danger i considered rumor their suppression as artful manoeuvre their own deceive their adversaries their past successes which had been uninterrupted gave me so terrible idea power that i already was grieved at overthrow parliament i knew m de choiseul had prosecuted his studies under jesuits that madam de pompadour was not upon bad terms with them that their league with favorites ministers had constantly appeared advantageous their order against their common enemies court seemed remain neutral persuaded as i was that should society receive severe check it would not come from parliament i saw inaction government ground their confidence omen their triumph fine perceiving rumors day nothing more than art dissimulation on their part thinking they their state security had time watch over all their interests i had had not least doubt their shortly crushing jansenism parliament encyclopedists with every other association which should not submit their yoke that if they ever suffered my work appear this would not happen until it should be so transformed as favor their pretensions thus make use my name better deceive my readers i felt my health strength decline such was horror with which my mind was filled at idea dishonor my memory work most worthy myself that i am surprised so many extravagant ideas did not occasion speedy end my existence i never was so much afraid death as at this time had i died with apprehensions i then had upon my mind i should have died despair at present although i perceive no obstacle execution blackest most dreadful conspiracy ever formed against memory man i shall die much more peace certain leaving my writings testimony my favor one which sooner or later will triumph over calumnies mankind m de malesherbes who discovered agitation my mind whom i acknowledged it used such endeavors restore me tranquility as proved his excessive goodness heart madam de luxembourg aided him his good work several times went duchesne know what state edition was at length impression was again begun progress it became more rapid than ever without my knowing for what reason it had been suspended m de malesherbes took trouble come montmorency calm my mind this he succeeded full confidence i had his uprightness having overcome derangement my poor head gave efficacy endeavors he made restore it after what he had seen my anguish delirium it was natural he should think i was be pitied he really commiserated my situation expressions incessantly repeated philosophical cabal by which he was surrounded occurred his memory when i went live at hermitage they as i have already remarked said i should not remain there long when they saw i persevered they charged me with obstinacy pride proceeding from want courage retract insisted that my life was there burden me short that i was very wretched m de malesherbes believed this really be case wrote me upon subject this error man for whom i had so much esteem gave me some pain i wrote him four letters successively which i stated real motives my conduct made him fully acquainted with my taste inclination character with most interior sentiments my heart these letters written hastily almost without taking pen from paper which i neither copied corrected nor even read are perhaps only things i ever wrote with facility which midst my sufferings was i think astonishing i sighed as i felt myself declining at thought leaving midst honest men opinion me so far from truth by sketch hastily given my four letters i endeavored some measure substitute them memoirs i had proposed write they are expressive my grief m de malesherbes who showed them paris are besides kind summary what i here give detail on this account merit preservation copy i begged them some years afterwards will be found amongst my papers only thing which continued give me pain idea my approaching dissolution was my not having man letters for friend whom i could confide my papers that after my death he might take proper choice such as were worthy publication after my journey geneva i conceived friendship for moultou this young man pleased me i could have wished him receive my last breath i expressed him this desire am opinion he would readily have complied with it had not his affairs prevented him from so doing deprived this consolation i still wished give him mark my confidence by sending him profession faith savoyard vicar before it was published he was pleased with work but did not his answer seem so fully expect from it effect which i had but little doubt he wished receive from me some fragment which i had not given anybody else i sent him funeral oration late duke orleans this i had written for abbe darty who had not pronounced it because contrary his expectation another person was appointed perform that ceremony printing emilius after having been again taken hand was continued completed without much difficulty i remarked this singularity that after curtailings so much insisted upon first two volumes last two were passed over without objection their contents did not delay publication for moment i had however some uneasiness which i must not pass over silence after having been afraid jesuits i begun fear jansenists philosophers enemy party faction cabal i never heard least good parties concerned them gossips had quitted their old abode taken up their residence by side me so that their chamber everything said mine upon terrace was distinctly heard from their garden it would have been easy scale low wall by which it was separated from my alcove this was become my study my table was covered with proofsheets emilius social contract stitching these sheets as they were sent me i had all my volumes long time before they were published my negligence confidence i had m mathas whose garden i was shut up frequently made me forget lock door at night morning i several times found it wide open this however would not have given me least inquietude had i not thought my papers seemed have been deranged after having several times made same remark i became more careful locked door lock was bad one key turned it no more than half round as i became more attentive i found my papers much greater confusion than they were when i left everything open at length i missed one my volumes without knowing what was become it until morning third day when i again found it upon table i never suspected either m mathas or his nephew m du moulin knowing myself be beloved by both my confidence them was unbounded that i had gossips began diminish although they were jansenists i knew them have some connection with d alembert moreover they all three lodged same house this gave me some uneasiness put me more upon my guard i removed my papers from alcove my chamber dropped my acquaintance with these people having learned they had shown several houses first volume emilius which i had been imprudent enough lend them although they continued until my departure be my neighbors i never after my first suspicions had least communication with them social contract appeared month or two before emilius rey whom i had desired never secretly introduce into france any my books applied magistrate for leave send this book by rouen which place he sent his package by sea he received no answer his bales after remaining at rouen several months were returned him but not until attempt had been made confiscate them this probably would have been done had not he made great clamor several persons whose curiosity work had excited sent amsterdam for copies which were circulated without being much noticed maulion who had heard this had i believe seen work spoke me on subject with air mystery which surprised me would likewise have made me uneasy if certain having conformed every rule i had not by virtue my grand maxim kept my mind calm i moreover had no doubt but m de choiseul already well disposed towards me sensible eulogium his administration which my esteem for him had induced me make work would support me against malevolence madam de pompadour i certainly had then as much reason as ever hope for goodness m de luxembourg even for his assistance case need for he never at any time had given me more frequent more pointed marks his friendship at journey easter my melancholy state no longer permitting me go castle he never suffered day pass without coming see me at length perceiving my sufferings be incessant he prevailed upon me determine see friar come he immediately sent for him came with him had courage uncommon man his rank remain with me during operation which was cruel tedious upon first examination come thought he found great stone told me so at second he could not find it again after having made third attempt with so much care circumspection that i thought time long he declared there was no stone but that prostate gland was schirrous considerably thickened he besides added that i had great deal suffer should live long time should second prediction be as fully accomplished as first my sufferings are far from being at end it was thus i learned after having been so many years treated for disorders which i never had that my incurable disease without being mortal would last as long as myself my imagination repressed by this information no longer presented me prospective cruel death agonies stone delivered from imaginary evils more cruel me than those which were real i more patiently suffered latter it is certain i have since suffered less from my disorder than i had done before every time i recollect that i owe this alleviation m de luxembourg his memory becomes more dear me restored as i may say life more than ever occupied with plan according which i was determined pass rest my days all obstacle immediate execution my design was publication emilius i thought touraine where i had already been which pleased me much as well on account mildness climate as on that character inhabitants la terra molle lieta dilettosa simile se l habitator produce i had already spoken my project m de luxembourg who endeavored dissuade me from it i mentioned it him second time as thing resolved upon he then offered me castle merlon fifteen leagues from paris as asylum which might be agreeable me where he madam de luxembourg would have real pleasure seeing me settled proposition made pleasing impression on my mind but first thing necessary was see place we agreed upon day when marechal was send his valet de chambre with carriage take me it on day appointed i was much indisposed journey was postponed different circumstances prevented me from ever making it i have since learned estate merlou did not belong marechal but his lady on which account i was less sorry i had not gone live there emilius was at length given public without my having heard further retrenchments or difficulties previous publication marechal asked me for all letters m de malesherbes had written me on subject work my great confidence both perfect security which i felt myself prevented me from reflecting upon this extraordinary even alarming request i returned all letters excepting one or two which from inattention were left between leaves book little time before this m de malesherbes told me he should withdraw letters i had written duchesne during my alarm relative jesuits it must be confessed these letters did no great honor my reason but my answer i assured him i would not anything pass for being better than i was that he might leave letters where they were i know not what he resolved upon publication this work was not succeeded by applause which had followed that all my other writings no work was ever more highly spoken private nor had any literary production ever had less public approbation what was said written me upon subject by persons most capable judging confirmed me my opinion that it was best as well as most important all works i had produced but everything favorable was said with air most extraordinary mystery as if there had been necessity keeping it secret madam de boufflers who wrote me that author work merited statue homage mankind at end her letter desired it might be returned her d alembert who his note said work gave me decided superiority ought place me at head men letters did not sign what he wrote although he had signed every note i had before received from him duclos sure friend man veracity but circumspect although he had good opinion work avoided mentioning it his letters me la condomine fell upon confession faith wandered from subject clairaut confined himself same part but he was not afraid expressing me emotion which reading it had caused him most direct terms wrote me that it had warmed his old imagination all those whom i had sent my book he was only person who spoke freely what he thought it mathas whom i also had given copy before publication lent it m de blaire counsellor parliament strasbourg m de blaire had country house at st gratien mathas his old acquaintance sometimes went see him there he made him read emilius before it was published when he returned it him m de blaire expressed himself following terms which were repeated me same day m mathas this is very fine work but it will short time be spoken more than for author might be wished i laughed at prediction saw it nothing more than importance man robe who treats everything with air mystery all alarming observations repeated me made no impression upon my mind far from foreseeing catastrophe so near at hand certain utility excellence my work that i had every respect conformed established rules convinced as i thought i was that i should be supported by all credit m de luxembourg favor ministry i was satisfied with myself for resolution i had taken retire midst my triumphs at my return crush those by whom i was envied one thing publication work alarmed me less on account my safety than for unburdening my mind at hermitage at montmorency i had seen with indignation vexations which jealous care pleasures princes causes be exercised on wretched peasants forced suffer havoc made by game their fields without daring take any other measure prevent this devastation than that making noise passing night amongst beans peas with drums kettles bells keep off wild boars as i had been witness barbarous cruelty with which comte de charolois treated these poor people i had toward end emilius exclaimed against it this was another infraction my maxims which has not remained unpunished i was informed that people prince conti were but little less severe upon his estates i trembled lest that prince for whom i was penetrated with respect gratitude should take his own account what shocked humanity had made me say on that others feel himself offended yet as my conscience fully acquitted me upon this article i made myself easy by so doing acted wisely at least i have not heard that this great prince took notice passage which besides was written long before i had honor being known him few days either before or after publication my work for i do not exactly recollect time there appeared another work upon same subject taken verbatim from my first volume except few stupid things which were joined extract book bore name genevese one balexsert according title page had gained premium academy harlem i easily imagined academy premium be newly founded better conceal plagiarism from eyes public but i further perceived there was some prior intrigue which i could not unravel either by lending my manuscript without which theft could not have been committed or for purpose forging story pretended premium which it was necessary give some foundation it was not until several years afterwards that by word which escaped d ivernois i penetrated mystery discovered those by whom balexsert had been brought forward low murmurings which precede storm began be heard men penetration clearly saw there was something gathering relative me my book which would shortly break over my head for my part my stupidity was such that far from foreseeing my misfortune i did not suspect even cause it after i had felt its effect it was artfully given out that while jesuits were treated with severity no indulgence could be shown books nor authors them which religion was attacked i was reproached with having put my name emilius as if i had not put it all my other works which nothing was said government seemed fear it should be obliged take some steps which circumstances rendered necessary on account my imprudence rumors this effect reached my ears but gave me not much uneasiness it never even came into my head that there could be least thing whole affair which related me personally so perfectly irreproachable well supported did i think myself having besides conformed every ministerial regulation i did not apprehend madam de luxembourg would leave me difficulties for error which if it existed proceeded entirely from herself but knowing manner proceeding like cases that it was customary punish booksellers while authors were favored i had some uneasiness on account poor duchesne whom i saw exposed danger should m de malesherbes abandon him my tranquility still continued rumors increased soon changed their nature public especially parliament seemed irritated by my composure few days fermentation became terrible object menaces being changed these were immediately addressed me parliamentarians were heard declare that burning books was no effect authors also should be burned with them not word was said booksellers first time these expressions more worthy inquisitor goa than senator were related me i had no doubt their coming from holbachiques with intention alarm me drive me from france i laughed at their puerile manoeuvre said they would had they known real state things have thought some other means inspiring me with fear but rumor at length became such that i perceived matter was serious m madam de luxembourg had this year come montmorency month june which for their second journey was more early than common i heard but little there my new books notwithstanding noise they made paris neither marechal nor his lady said single word me on subject however one morning when m de luxembourg i were together he asked me if social contract i had spoken ill m de choiseul i said i retreating few steps with surprise no i swear you i have not but on contrary i have made on him with pen not given praise finest eulogium minister ever received i then showed him passage emilius replied he not word said i there is not it single word which relates him ah said he with more vivacity than was common him you should have taken same care other book or have expressed yourself more clearly i thought replied i what i wrote could not be misconstrued my esteem for him was such as make me extremely cautious not be equivocal he was again going speak i perceived him ready open his mind he stopped short held his tongue wretched policy courtier which best hearts subjugates friendship itself this conversation although short explained me my situation at least certain respects gave me understand that it was against myself anger administration was raised unheard fatality which turned my prejudice all good i did wrote afflicted my heart yet feeling myself shielded this affair by madam de luxembourg m de malesherbes i did not perceive what my persecutors could deprive me their protection however i from that moment was convinced equity judgment were no longer question that no pains would be spared examining whether or not i was culpable storm became still more menacing neaulme himself expressed me excess his babbling how much he repented having had anything do business his certainty fate with which book author were threatened one thing however alleviated my fears madam de luxembourg was so calm satisfied cheerful that i concluded she must necessarily be certain sufficiency her credit especially if she did not seem have least apprehension on my account moreover she said not me word either consolation or apology saw turn affair took with as much unconcern as if she had nothing do with it or anything else that related me what surprised me most was her silence i thought she should have said something on subject madam de boufflers seemed rather uneasy she appeared agitated strained herself good deal assured me prince conti was taking great pains ward off blow about be directed against my person which she attributed nature present circumstances which it was importance parliament not leave jesuits opening whereby they might bring accusation against it as being indifferent with respect religion she did not however seem depend much either upon success her own efforts or even those prince her conversations more alarming than consolatory all tended persuade me leave kingdom go england where she offered me introduction many her friends amongst others one celebrated hume with whom she had long been upon footing intimate friendship seeing me still unshaken she had recourse other arguments more capable disturbing my tranquillity she intimated that case i was arrested interrogated i should be under necessity naming madam de luxembourg that her friendship for me required on my part such precautions as were necessary prevent her being exposed my answer was that should what she seemed apprehend come pass she need not be alarmed that i should do nothing by which lady she mentioned might become sufferer she said such resolution was more easily taken than adhered this she was right especially with respect me determined as i always have been neither prejudice myself nor lie before judges whatever danger there might be speaking truth perceiving this observation had made some impression upon my mind without however inducing me resolve upon evasion she spoke bastile for few weeks as means placing me beyond reach jurisdiction parliament which has nothing do with prisoners state i had no objection this singular favor provided it were not solicited my name as she never spoke it second time i afterwards thought her proposition was made sound me that party did not think proper have recourse expedient which would have put end everything few days afterwards marechal received from cure de dueil friend grimm madam d epinay letter informing him as from good authority that parliament was proceed against me with greatest severity that on day which he mentioned order was be given arrest me i imagined this was fabricated by holbachiques i knew parliament be very attentive forms that on this occasion beginning by arresting me before it was juridically known i avowed myself author book was violating them all i observed madam de boufflers that none but persons accused crimes which tend endanger public safety were on simple information ordered be arrested lest they should escape punishment but when government wish punish crime like mine which merits honor recompense proceedings are directed against book author is as much as possible left out question upon this she made some subtle distinction which i have forgotten prove that ordering me be arrested instead summoning me be heard was matter favor next day i received letter from guy who informed me that having morning been with attorney general he had seen his office rough draft requisition against emilius author guy it is be remembered was partner duchesne who had printed work without apprehensions on his own account charitably gave this information author credit i gave him maybe judged it was no doubt very probable story that bookseller admitted audience by attorney general should read at ease scattered rough drafts office that magistrate madam de boufflers others confirmed what he had said by absurdities which were incessantly rung my ears i was almost tempted believe that everybody i heard speak had lost their senses clearly perceiving that there was some mystery which no one thought proper explain me i patiently awaited event depending upon my integrity innocence thinking myself happy let persecution which awaited me be what it would be called honor suffering cause truth far from being afraid concealing myself i went every day castle afternoon took my usual walk on eighth june evening before order was concluded on i walked company with two professors oratory father alamanni father mandard we carried champeaux little collation which we ate with keen appetite we had forgotten bring glasses supplied want them by stalks rye through which we sucked up wine from bottle piquing ourselves upon choice large tubes vie with each other pumping up what we drank i never was more cheerful my life i have related what manner i lost my sleep during my youth i had since that time contracted habit reading every night my bed until i found my eyes begin grow heavy i then extinguished my wax taper endeavored slumber for few moments which were general very short book i commonly read at night was bible which this manner i read five or six times from beginning end this evening finding myself less disposed sleep than ordinary i continued my reading beyond usual hour read whole book which finishes at levite ephraim book judges if i mistake not for since that time i have never once seen it this history affected me exceedingly kind dream my imagination still ran on it when suddenly i was roused from my stupor by noise light theresa carrying candle lighted m la roche who perceiving me hastily raise myself up said do not be alarmed i come from madam de luxembourg who her letter incloses you another from prince conti fact letter madam de luxembourg i found another which express from prince had brought her stating that notwithstanding all his efforts it was determined proceed against me with utmost rigor fermentation said he is extreme nothing can ward off blow court requires it parliament will absolutely proceed at seven o clock morning order will be made arrest him persons will immediately be sent execute it i have obtained promise that he shall not be pursued if he makes his escape but if he persists exposing himself be taken this will immediately happen la roche conjured me behalf madam de luxembourg rise go speak her it was two o clock she had just retired bed she expects you added he will not go sleep without speaking you i dressed myself haste ran her she appeared be agitated this was for first time her distress affected me this moment surprise night i myself was not free from emotion but on seeing her i forgot my own situation thought nothing but melancholy part she would have act should i suffer myself be arrested for feeling i had sufficient courage strictly adhere truth although i might be certain its being prejudicial or even destructive me i was convinced i had not presence mind address nor perhaps firmness enough not expose her should i be closely pressed this determined me sacrifice my reputation her tranquillity do for her that which nothing could have prevailed upon me do for myself moment i had come this resolution i declared it wishing not diminish magnitude sacrifice by giving her least trouble obtain it i am sure she could not mistake my motive although she said not word which proved me she was sensible it i was so much shocked at her indifference that i for moment thought retracting but marechal came madam de boufflers arrived from paris few moments afterwards they did what madam de luxembourg ought have done i suffered myself be flattered i was ashamed retract only thing that remained be determined upon was place my retreat time my departure m de luxembourg proposed me remain incognito few days at castle that we might deliberate at leisure take such measures as should seem most proper this i would not consent no more than go secretly temple i was determined set off same day rather than remain concealed any place whatever knowing i had secret powerful enemies kingdom i thought notwithstanding my attachment france i ought quit it better insure my future tranquillity my first intention was retire geneva but moment reflection was sufficient dissuade me from committing that act folly i knew ministry france more powerful at geneva than at paris would not leave me more at peace one these cities than other were resolution taken torment me i was also convinced discourse upon inequality had excited against me council hatred more dangerous as council dared not make it manifest i had also learned that when new eloisa appeared same council had immediately forbidden sale that work upon solicitation doctor tronchin but perceiving example not be imitated even paris members were ashamed what they had done withdrew prohibition i had no doubt that finding present case more favorable opportunity they would be very careful take advantage it notwithstanding exterior appearances i knew there reigned against me heart every genevese secret jealousy which first favorable moment would publicly show itself nevertheless love my country called me it could i have flattered myself i should there have lived peace i should not have hesitated but neither honor nor reason permitting me take refuge as fugitive place which i was citizen i resolved approach it only wait switzerland until something relative me should be determined upon geneva this state uncertainty did not as it will soon appear continue long madam de boufflers highly disapproved this resolution renewed her efforts induce me go england but all she could say was no effect i had never loved england nor english eloquence madam de boufflers far from conquering my repugnancy seemed increase it without my knowing why determined set off same day i was from morning inaccessible everybody la roche whom i sent fetch my papers would not tell theresa whether or not i was gone since i had determined write my own memoirs i had collected great number letters other papers so that he was obliged return several times part these papers already selected were laid aside i employed morning sorting rest that i might take with me such only as were necessary destroy what remained m de luxembourg was kind enough assist me this business which we could not finish before it was necessary i should set off i had not time burn single paper marechal offered take upon himself sort what i should leave behind me throw into fire every sheet that he found useless without trusting any person whomsoever send me those which he should make choice i accepted his offer very glad be delivered from that care that i might pass few hours i had remain with persons so dear me from whom i was going separate forever he took key chamber which i had left these papers at my earnest solicitation sent for my poor aunt who not knowing what had become me or what was become herself momentary expectation arrival officers justice without knowing how act or what answer them was miserable extreme la roche accompanied her castle silence she thought i was already far from montmorency on perceiving me she made place resound with her cries threw herself into my arms oh friendship affinity sentiment habit intimacy this pleasing yet cruel moment remembrance so many days happiness tenderness peace passed together augmented grief first separation after union seventeen years during which we had scarcely lost sight each other for single day illustration 0248 marechal who saw this embrace could not suppress his tears he withdrew theresa determined never more leave me out her sight i made her feel inconvenience accompanying me at that moment necessity her remaining take care my effects collect my money when order is made arrest man it is customary seize his papers put seal upon his effects or make inventory them appoint guardian whose care they are intrusted it was necessary theresa should remain observe what passed get everything settled most advantageous manner possible i promised her she should shortly come me marechal confirmed my promise but i did not choose tell her what place i was going that case being interrogated by persons who came take me into custody she might with truth plead ignorance upon that head embracing her moment before we separated i felt within me most extraordinary emotion i said her with agitation which alas was but too prophetic my dear girl you must arm yourself with courage you have partaken my prosperity it now remains you since you have chosen it partake my misery expect nothing future but insult calamity following me destiny begun for me by this melancholy day will pursue me until my latest hour i had now nothing think but my departure officers were arrive at ten o clock it was four afternoon when i set off they were not yet come it was determined i should take post i had no carriage marechal made me present cabriolet lent me horses postillion first stage where consequence measures he had taken i had no difficulty procuring others as i had not dined at table nor made my appearance castle ladies came bid me adieu entresol where i had passed day madam de luxembourg embraced me several times with melancholy air but i did not these embraces feel pressing i had done those she had lavished upon me two or three years before madam de boufflers also embraced me said me many civil things embrace which surprised me more than all rest had done was one from madam de mirepoix for she also was at castle madam la marechale de mirepoix is person extremely cold decent reserved did not at least as she appeared me seem quite exempt from natural haughtiness house lorraine she had never shown me much attention whether flattered by honor i had not expected i endeavored enhance value it or that there really was embrace little that commiseration natural generous hearts i found her manner look something energetical which penetrated me i have since that time frequently thought that acquainted with my destiny she could not refrain from momentary concern for my fate marechal did not open his mouth he was as pale as death he would absolutely accompany me carriage which waited at watering place we crossed garden without uttering single word i had key park with which i opened gate instead putting it again into my pocket i held it out marechal without saying word he took it with vivacity which surprised me which has since frequently intruded itself upon my thoughts i have not my whole life had more bitter moment than that this separation our embrace was long silent we both felt that this was our last adieu between barre montmorency i met hired carriage four men black who saluted me smilingly according what theresa has since told me officers justice hour their arrival their manner behavior i have no doubt that they were persons i met especially as order arrest me instead being made out at seven o clock as i had been told it would had not been given till noon i had go through paris person cabriolet is not much concealed i saw several persons streets who saluted me with air familiarity but i did not know one them same evening i changed my route pass villeroy at lyons couriers were conducted commandant this might have been embarrassing man unwilling either lie or change his name i went with letter from madam de luxembourg beg m de villeroy would spare me this disagreeable ceremony m de villeroy gave me letter which i made no use because i did not go through lyons this letter still remains sealed up amongst my papers duke pressed me sleep at villeroy but i preferred returning great road which i did travelled two more stages same evening my carriage was inconvenient uncomfortable i was too much indisposed go far day my appearance besides was not sufficiently distinguished for me be well served france post horses feel whip proportion favorable opinion postillion has his temporary master by paying guides generously thought i should make up for my shabby appearance this was still worse they took me for worthless fellow who was carrying orders for first time my life travelling post from that moment i had nothing but worn out hacks i became sport postillions i ended as i should have begun by being patient holding my tongue suffering myself be driven as my conductors thought proper i had sufficient matter reflection prevent me from being weary on road employing myself recollection that which had just happened but this was neither my turn mind nor inclination my heart facility with which i forget past evils however recent they may be is astonishing remembrance them becomes feeble sooner or later effaced inverse proportion greater degree fear with which approach them inspires me my cruel imagination incessantly tormented by apprehension evils still at distance diverts my attention prevents me from recollecting those which are past caution is needless after evil has happened it is time lost give it thought i some measure put period my misfortunes before they happen more i have suffered at their approach greater is facility with which i forget them whilst on contrary incessantly recollecting my past happiness i if i may so speak enjoy it second time at pleasure it is this happy disposition i am indebted for exemption from that ill humor which ferments vindictive mind by continual remembrance injuries received torments it with all evil it wishes do its enemy naturally choleric i have felt all force anger which first moments has sometimes been carried fury but desire vengeance never took root within me i think too little offence give myself much trouble about offender i think injury i have received from him on account that he may do me second time but were i certain he would never do me another first would be instantly forgotten pardon offences is continually preached us i knew not whether or not my heart would be capable overcoming its hatred for it never yet felt that passion i give myself too little concern about my enemies have merit pardoning them i will not say what degree order torment me they torment themselves i am at their mercy they have unbounded power make it what use they please there is but one thing which i set them at defiance which is tormenting themselves about me force me give myself least trouble about them day after my departure i had so perfectly forgotten what had passed parliament madam de pompadour m de choiseul grimm d alembert with their conspiracies that had not it been for necessary precautions during journey i should have thought no more them remembrance one thing which supplied place all these was what i had read evening before my departure i recollect also pastorals gessner which his translator hubert had sent me little time before these two ideas occurred me so strongly were connected such manner my mind that i was determined endeavor unite them by treating after manner gessner subject levite ephraim his pastoral simple style appeared me but little fitted so horrid subject it was not be presumed situation i was then would furnish me with such ideas as would enliven it however i attempted thing solely amuse myself my cabriolet without least hope success i had no sooner begun than i was astonished at liveliness my ideas facility with which i expressed them three days i composed first three cantos little poem i finished at motiers i am certain not having done anything my life which there is more interesting mildness manners greater brilliancy coloring more simple delineations greater exactness proportion or more antique simplicity general notwithstanding horror subject which itself is abominable so that besides every other merit i had still that difficulty conquered if levite ephraim be not best my works it will ever be that most esteemed i have never read nor shall i ever read it again without feeling interiorly applause heart without acrimony which far from being embittered by misfortunes is susceptible consolation midst them finds within itself resource by which they are counterbalanced assemble great philosophers so superior their books adversity which they do not suffer place them situation similar mine first moments indignation their injured honor give them like work compose it will be seen what manner they will acquit themselves task when i set off from montmorency go into switzerland i had resolved stop at yverdon at house my old friend roguin who had several years before retired that place had invited me go see him i was told lyons was not direct road for which reason i avoided going through it but i was obliged pass through besancon fortified town consequently subject same inconvenience i took it into my head turn about go salins under pretense going see m de marian nephew m dupin who had employment at salt works formerly had given me many invitations his house expedition succeeded m de marian was not way happily not being obliged stop i continued my journey without being spoken by anybody moment i was within territory berne i ordered postillion stop i got out my carriage prostrated myself kissed ground exclaimed transport joy heaven protector virtue be praised i touch land liberty thus blind unsuspecting my hopes have i ever been passionately attached that which was make me unhappy man thought me mad i got into carriage few hours afterwards i had pure lively satisfaction feeling myself pressed within arms respectable rougin ah let me breathe for moment with this worthy host it is necessary i should gain strength courage before i proceed further i shall soon find that my way which will give employment them both it is not without reason that i have been diffuse recital all circumstances i have been able recollect although they may seem uninteresting yet when once thread conspiracy is got hold they may throw some light upon progress it for instance without giving first idea problem i am going propose afford some aid solving it suppose that for execution conspiracy which i was object my absence was absolutely necessary everything tending that effect could not have happened otherwise than it did but if without suffering myself be alarmed by nocturnal embassy madam de luxembourg i had continued hold out instead remaining at castle had returned my bed quietly slept until morning should i have equally had order arrest made out against me this is great question upon which solution many others depends for examination it hour comminatory decree arrest that real decree may be remarked advantage rude but sensible example importance least detail exposition facts which secret causes are sought for discover them by induction book xii with this book begins work darkness which i have for last eight years been enveloped though it has not by any means been possible for me penetrate dreadful obscurity abyss evil into which i am plunged i feel blows reach me without perceiving hand by which they are directed or means it employs shame misfortune seem themselves fall upon me when affliction my heart i suffer groan escape me i have appearance man who complains without reason authors my ruin have inconceivable art rendering public unknown itself or without its perceiving effects it accomplice their conspiracy therefore my narrative circumstances relative myself treatment i have received all that has happened me i shall not be able indicate hand by which whole has been directed nor assign causes while i state effect primitive causes are all given preceding books everything which i am interested all secret motives pointed out but it is impossible for me explain even by conjecture that which different causes are combined operate strange events my life if amongst my readers one even them should be generous enough wish examine mystery bottom discover truth let him carefully read over second time three preceding books afterwards at each fact he shall find stated books which follow let him gain such information as is within his reach go back from intrigue intrigue from agent agent until he comes first mover all i know where his researches will terminate but meantime i lose myself crooked obscure subterraneous path through which his steps must be directed during my stay at yverdon i became acquainted with all family my friend roguin amongst others with his niece madam boy de la tour her daughters whose father as i think i have already observed i formerly knew at lyons she was at yverdon upon visit her uncle his sister her eldest daughter about fifteen years age delighted me by her fine understanding excellent disposition i conceived most tender friendship for mother daughter latter was destined by m rougin colonel his nephew man already verging towards decline life who showed me marks great esteem affection but although heart uncle was set upon this marriage which was much wished for by nephew also i was greatly desirous promote satisfaction both great disproportion age extreme repugnancy young lady made me join with mother postponing ceremony affair was at length broken off colonel has since married mademoiselle dillan his relation beautiful amiable as my heart could wish who has made him happiest husbands fathers however m rougin has not yet forgotten my opposition his wishes my consolation is certainty having discharged him his family duty most pure friendship which does not always consist being agreeable but advising for best i did not remain long doubt about reception which awaited me at geneva had i chosen return that city my book was burned there on 18th june nine days after order arrest me had been given at paris another same effect was determined upon by republic so many incredible absurdities were stated this second decree which ecclesiastical edict was formally violated that i refused believe first accounts i heard it when these were well confirmed i trembled lest so manifest infraction every law beginning with that common sense should create greatest confusion city i was however relieved from my fears everything remained quiet if there was any rumor amongst populace it was unfavorable me i was publicly treated by all gossips pedants like scholar threatened with flogging for not having said his catechism these two decrees were signal for cry malediction raised against me with unexampled fury every part europe all gazettes journals pamphlets rang alarm bell french especially that mild generous polished people who so much pique themselves upon their attention proper condescension unfortunate instantly forgetting their favorite virtues signalized themselves by number violence outrages with which while each seemed strive who should afflict me most they overwhelmed me i was impious atheist madman wild beast wolf continuator journal trevoux was guilty piece extravagance attacking my pretended lycanthropy which was by no means proof his own stranger would have thought author paris was afraid incurring animadversion police by publishing work any kind without cramming into it some insult me i sought vain cause this unanimous animosity was almost tempted believe world was gone mad what said i myself editor perpetual peace spread discord author confession savoyard vicar impious writer new eloisa wolf author emilius madman gracious god what then should i have been had i published treatise esprit or any similar work yet storm raised against author that book public far from joining cry his persecutors revenged him them by eulogium let his book mine receptions two works met with treatment two authors different countries europe be compared for difference let causes satisfactory man sense be found i will ask no more i found residence yverdon so agreeable that i resolved yield solicitations m roguin his family who were desirous keeping me there m de moiry de gingins bailiff that city encouraged me by his goodness remain within his jurisdiction colonel pressed me so much accept for my habitation little pavilion he had his house between court garden that i complied with his request he immediately furnished it with everything necessary for my little household establishment banneret roguin one persons who showed me most assiduous attention did not leave me for instant during whole day i was much flattered by his civilities but they sometimes importuned me day on which i was take possession my new habitation was already fixed i had written theresa come me when suddenly storm was raised against me berne which was attributed devotees but i have never been able learn cause it senate excited against me without my knowing by whom did not seem disposed suffer me remain undisturbed my retreat moment bailiff was informed new fermentation he wrote my favor several members government reproaching them with their blind intolerance telling them it was shameful refuse man merit under oppression asylum which such numerous banditti found their states sensible people were opinion warmth his reproaches had rather embittered than softened minds magistrates however this may be neither his influence nor eloquence could ward off blow having received intimation order he was signify me he gave me previous communication it that i might wait its arrival i resolved set off next day difficulty was know where go finding myself shut out from geneva all france foreseeing that affair each state would be anxious imitate its neighbor madam boy de la tour proposed me go reside uninhabited but completely furnished house which belonged her son village motiers val de travers county neuchatel i had only mountain cross arrive at it offer came more opportunely as states king prussia i should naturally be sheltered from all persecution at least religion could not serve as pretext for it but secret difficulty improper for me at that moment divulge had it that which was very sufficient make me hesitate innnate love justice which my heart was constantly subject added my secret inclination france had inspired me with aversion king prussia who by his maxims conduct seemed tread under foot all respect for natural law every duty humanity amongst framed engravings with which i had decorated my alcove at montmorency was portrait this prince under it distich last line which was as follows il pense en philosophe et se conduit en roi he thinks like philosopher acts like king this verse which from any other pen would have been fine eulogium from mine had unequivocal meaning too clearly explained verse by which it was preceded distich had been read by everybody who came see me my visitors were numerous chevalier de lorenzy had even written it down give it d alembert i had no doubt but d alembert had taken care make my court with it prince i had also aggravated this first fault by passage emilius where under name adrastus king daunians it was clearly seen whom i had view remark had not escaped critics because madam de boufflers had several times mentioned subject me i was therefore certain being inscribed red ink registers king prussia besides supposing his majesty have principles i had dared attribute him he for that reason could not but be displeased with my writings their author for everybody knows worthless part mankind tyrants have never failed conceive most mortal hatred against me solely on reading my works without being acquainted with my person however i had presumption enough depend upon his mercy was far from thinking i ran much risk i knew none but weak men were slaves base passions that these had but little power over strong minds such as i had always thought his be according his art reigning i thought he could not but show himself magnanimous on this occasion that being so fact was not above his character i thought mean easy vengeance would not for moment counterbalance his love glory putting myself his place his taking advantage circumstances overwhelm with weight his generosity man who had dared think ill him did not appear me impossible i therefore went settle at motiers with confidence which i imagined he would feel all value said myself when jean jacques rises elevation coriolanus will frederick sink below general volsci colonel roguin insisted on crossing mountain with me installing me at moiters sister law madam boy de la tour named madam girardier whom house which i was going live was very convenient did not see me arrive there with pleasure however she with good grace put me possession my lodgings i ate with her until theresa came my little establishment was formed perceiving at my departure from montmorency i should future be fugitive upon earth i hesitated about permitting her come me partake wandering life which i saw myself condemned i felt nature our relation each other was about change that what until then had on my part been favor friendship would future become so on hers if her attachment was proof against my misfortunes this i knew she must become victim that her grief would add my pain should my disgrace weaken her affections she would make me consider her constancy as sacrifice instead feeling pleasure i had dividing with her my last morsel bread she would see nothing but her own merit following me wherever i was driven by fate i must say everything i have never concealed vices either my poor mamma or myself i cannot be more favorable theresa whatever pleasure i may have doing honor person who is dear me i will not disguise truth although it may discover her error if involuntary change affections heart be one i had long perceived hers grow cooler towards me that she was no longer for me what she had been our younger days this i was more sensible as for her i was what i had always been i fell into same inconvenience as that which i had felt effect with mamma this effect was same now i was with theresa let us not seek for perfection which nature never produces it would be same thing with any other woman manner which i had disposed my children however reasonable it had appeared me had not always left my heart at ease while writing my treatise on education i felt i had neglected duties with which it was not possible dispense remorse at length became so strong that it almost forced from me public confession my fault at beginning my emilius passage is so clear that it is astonishing any person should after reading it have had courage reproach me with my error my situation was however still same or something worse by animosity my enemies who sought find me fault i feared relapse unwilling run risk i preferred abstinence exposing theresa similar mortification i had besides remarked that connection with women was prejudicial my health this double reason made me form resolutions which i had but sometimes badly kept but for last three or four years i had more constantly adhered them it was this interval i had remarked theresa s coolness she had same attachment me from duty but not least from love our intercourse naturally became less agreeable i imagined that certain continuation my cares wherever she might be she would choose stay at paris rather than wander with me yet she had given such signs grief at our parting had required me such positive promises that we should meet again since my departure had expressed prince de conti m de luxembourg so strong desire it that far from having courage speak her separation i scarcely had enough think it myself after having felt my heart how impossible it was for me do without her all i thought afterwards was recall her me as soon as possible i wrote her this effect she came it was scarcely two months since i had quitted her but it was our first separation after union so many years we had both us felt it most cruelly what emotion our first embrace o how delightful are tears tenderness joy how does my heart drink them up why have i not had reason shed them more frequently on my arrival at motiers i had written lord keith marshal scotland governor neuchatel informing him my retreat into states his prussian majesty requesting him his protection he answered me with his well known generosity manner i had expected from him he invited me his house i went with m martinet lord manor val de travers who was great favor with his excellency venerable appearance this illustrious virtuous scotchman powerfully affected my heart from that instant began between him me strong attachment which on my part still remains same would be so on his had not traitors who have deprived me all consolation life taken advantage my absence deceive his old age depreciate me his esteem george keith hereditary marshal scotland brother famous general keith who lived gloriously died bed honor had quitted his country at very early age was proscribed on account his attachment house stuart with that house however he soon became disgusted with unjust tyrannical spirit he remarked ruling character stuart family he lived long time spain climate which pleased him exceedingly at length attached himself as his brother had done service king prussia who knew men gave them reception they merited his majesty received great return for this reception services rendered him by marshal keith by what was infinitely more precious sincere friendship his lordship great mind this worthy man haughty republican could stoop no other yoke than that friendship but this it was so obedient that with very different maxims he saw nothing but frederic moment he became attached him king charged marshal with affairs importance sent him paris spain at length seeing he was already advanced years let him retire with government neuchatel delightful employment passing there remainder his life rendering inhabitants happy people neuchatel whose manners are trivial know not how distinguish solid merit suppose wit consist long discourses when they saw sedate man simple manners appear amongst them they mistook his simplicity for haughtiness his candor for rusticity his laconism for stupidity rejected his benevolent cares because wishing be useful not being sycophant he knew not how flatter people he did not esteem ridiculous affair minister petitpierre who was displaced by his colleagues for having been unwilling they should be eternally damned my lord opposing usurpations ministers saw whole country which he took part rise up against him when i arrived there stupid murmur had not entirely subsided he passed for man influenced by prejudices with which he was inspired by others all imputations brought against him it was most devoid truth my first sentiment on seeing this venerable old man was that tender commiseration on account his extreme leanness body years having already left him little else but skin bone but when i raised my eyes his animated open noble countenance i felt respect mingled with confidence which absorbed every other sentiment he answered very short compliment i made him when i first came into his presence by speaking something else as if i had already been week his house he did not bid us sit down stupid chatelain lord manor remained standing for my part i at first sight saw fine piercing eye his lordship something so conciliating that feeling myself entirely at ease i without ceremony took my seat by his side upon sofa by familiarity his manner i immediately perceived liberty i took gave him pleasure that he said himself this is not neuchatelois singular effect similarity characters at age when heart loses its natural warmth that this good old man grew warm by his attachment me degree which surprised everybody he came see me at motiers under pretence quail shooting stayed there two days without touching gun we conceived such friendship for each other that we knew not how live separate castle colombier where he passed summer was six leagues from motiers i went there at least once fortnight made stay twenty four hours then returned like pilgrim with my heart full affection for my host emotion i had formerly experienced my journeys from hermitage eaubonne was certainly very different but it was not more pleasing than that with which i approached columbier what tears tenderness have i shed when on road it while thinking paternal goodness amiable virtues charming philosophy this respectable old man i called him father he called me son these affectionate names give some measure idea attachment by which we were united but by no means that want we felt each other nor our continual desire be together he would absolutely give me apartment at castle columbier for long time pressed me take up my residence that which i lodged during my visits i at length told him i was more free at my ease my own house that i had rather continue until end my life come see him he approved my candor never afterwards spoke me on subject oh my good lord oh my worthy father how is my heart still moved when i think your goodness ah barbarous wretches how deeply did they wound me when they deprived me your friendship but no great man you are ever will be same for me who am still same you have been deceived but you are not changed my lord marechal is not without faults he is man wisdom but he is still man with greatest penetration nicest discrimination most profound knowledge men he sometimes suffers himself be deceived never recovers his error his temper is very singular foreign his general turn mind he seems forget people he sees every day thinks them moment when they least expect it his attention seems ill timed his presents are dictated by caprice not by propriety he gives or sends instant whatever comes into his head be value it ever so small young genevese desirous entering into service prussia made personal application him his lordship instead giving him letter gave him little bag peas which he desired him carry king on receiving this singular recommendation his majesty gave commission bearer it these elevated geniuses have between themselves language which vulgar will never understand whimsical manner my lord marechal something like caprice fine woman rendered him still more interesting me i was certain afterwards had proofs that it had not least influence over his sentiments nor did it affect cares prescribed by friendship on serious occasions yet his manner obliging there is same singularity as his manners general this i will give one instance relative matter no great importance journey from motiers colombier being too long for me perform one day i commonly divided it by setting off after dinner sleeping at brot which is half way landlord house where i stopped named sandoz having solicit at berlin favor importance him begged i would request his excellency ask it his behalf most willingly said i took him with me i left him antechamber mentioned matter his lordship who returned me no answer after passing with him whole morning i saw as i crossed hall go dinner poor sandoz who was fatigued death with waiting thinking governor had forgotten what i had said him i again spoke business before we sat down table but still received no answer i thought this manner making me feel i was importunate rather severe pitying poor man waiting held my tongue on my return next day i was much surprised at thanks he returned me for good dinner his excellency had given him after receiving his paper three weeks afterwards his lordship sent him rescript he had solicited dispatched by minister signed by king this without having said word either myself or sandoz concerning business about which i thought he did not wish give himself least concern i could wish incessantly speak george keith from him proceeds my recollection last happy moments i have enjoyed rest my life since our separation has been passed affliction grief heart remembrance this is so melancholy confused that it was impossible for me observe least order what i write so that future i shall be under necessity stating facts without giving them regular arrangement i was soon relieved from my inquietude arising from uncertainty my asylum by answer from his majesty lord marshal whom as it will readily be believed i had found able advocate king not only approved what he had done but desired him for i must relate everything give me twelve louis good old man rather embarrassed by commission not knowing how execute it properly endeavored soften insult by transforming money into provisions writing me that he had received orders furnish me with wood coal begin my little establishment he moreover added perhaps from himself that his majesty would willingly build me little house such one as i should choose have provided i would fix upon ground i was extremely sensible kindness last offer which made me forget weakness other without accepting either i considered frederic as my benefactor protector became so sincerely attached him that from that moment i interested myself as much his glory as until then i had thought his successes unjust at peace he made soon after i expressed my joy by illumination very good taste it was string garlands with which i decorated house i inhabited which it is true i had vindictive haughtiness spend almost as much money as he had wished give me peace ratified i thought as he was at highest pinnacle military political fame he would think acquiring that another nature by reanimating his states encouraging them commerce agriculture creating new soil covering it with new people maintaining peace amongst his neighbors becoming arbitrator after having been terror europe he was situation sheath his sword without danger certain that no sovereign would oblige him again draw it perceiving he did not disarm i was afraid he would profit but little by advantages he had gained that he would be great only by halves i dared write him upon subject with familiarity nature please men his character conveying him sacred voice truth which but few kings are worthy hear liberty i took was secret between him myself i did not communicate it even lord marshal whom i sent my letter king sealed up his lordship forwarded my dispatch without asking what it contained his majesty returned me no answer marshal going soon after berlin king told him he had received from me scolding by this i understood my letter had been ill received frankness my zeal had been mistaken for rusticity pedant fact this might possibly be case perhaps i did not say what was necessary nor manner proper occasion all i can answer for is sentiment which induced me take up pen shortly after my establishment at motiers travers having every possible assurance that i should be suffered remain there peace i took armenian habit this was not first time i had thought doing it i had formerly had same intention particularly at montmorency where frequent use probes often obliging me keep my chamber made me more clearly perceive advantages long robe convenience armenian tailor who frequently came see relation he had at montmorency almost tempted me determine on taking this new dress troubling myself but little about what world would say it yet before i concluded about matter i wished take opinion m de luxembourg who immediately advised me follow my inclination i therefore procured little armenian wardrobe but on account storm raised against me i was induced postpone making use it until i should enjoy tranquillity it was not until some months afterwards that forced by new attacks my disorder i thought i could properly without least risk put on my new dress at motiers especially after having consulted pastor place who told me i might wear it even temple without indecency i then adopted waistcoat caffetan fur bonnet girdle after having this dress attended divine service i saw no impropriety going it visit his lordship his excellency seeing me clothed this manner made me no other compliment than that which consisted saying salaam aleki i e peace be with you common turkish salutation after which nothing more was said upon subject i continued wear my new dress having quite abandoned literature all i now thought was leading quiet life one as agreeable as i could make it when alone i have never felt weariness mind not even complete inaction my imagination filling up every void was sufficient keep up my attention inactive babbling private circle where seated opposite each other they who speak move nothing but tongue is only thing i have ever been unable support when walking rambling about there is some satisfaction conversation feet eyes do something but hear people with their arms across speak weather biting flies or what is still worse compliment each other is me insupportable torment that i might not live like savage i took it into my head learn make laces like women i carried my cushion with me when i went make visits or sat down work at my door chatted with passers by this made me better support emptiness babbling enabled me pass my time with my female neighbors without weariness several these were very amiable not devoid wit one particular isabella d ivernois daughter attorney general neuchatel i found so estimable as induce me enter with her into terms particular friendship from which she derived some advantage by useful advice i gave her services she received from me on occasions importance so that now worthy virtuous mother family she is perhaps indebted me for her reason her husband her life happiness on my part i received from her gentle consolation particularly during melancholy winter throughout whole which when my sufferings were most cruel she came pass with theresa me long evenings which she made very short for us by her agreeable conversation our mutual openness heart she called me papa i called her daughter these names which we still give each other will i hope continue be as dear her as they are me that my laces might be some utility i gave them my young female friends at their marriages upon condition their suckling their children isabella s eldest sister had one upon these terms well deserved it by her observance them isabella herself also received another which by intention she as fully merited she has not been happy enough be able pursue her inclination when i sent laces two sisters i wrote each them letter first has been shown about world second has not same celebrity friendship proceeds with less noise amongst connections i made my neighborhood which i will not enter into detail i must mention that with colonel pury who had house upon mountain where he came pass summer i was not anxious become acquainted with him because i knew he was upon bad terms at court with lord marshal whom he did not visit yet as he came see me showed me much attention i was under necessity returning his visit this was repeated we sometimes dined with each other at his house i became acquainted with m du perou afterwards too intimately connected with him pass his name over silence m du perou was american son commandant surinam whose successor m le chambrier neuchatel married his widow left widow second time she came with her son live country her second husband du perou only son very rich tenderly beloved by his mother had been carefully brought up his education was not lost upon him he had acquired much knowledge taste for arts piqued himself upon his having cultivated his rational faculty his dutch appearance yellow complexion silent close disposition favored this opinion although young he was already deaf gouty this rendered his motions deliberate very grave although he was fond disputing he general spoke but little because his hearing was bad i was struck with his exterior said myself this is thinker man wisdom such one as anybody would be happy have for friend he frequently addressed himself me without paying least compliment this strengthened favorable opinion i had already formed him he said but little me myself or my books still less himself he was not destitute ideas what he said was just this justness equality attracted my regard he had neither elevation mind nor discrimination lord marshal but he had all his simplicity this was still representing him something i did not become infatuated with him but he acquired my attachment from esteem by degrees this esteem led friendship i totally forgot objection i made baron holbach that he was too rich for long time i saw but little du perou because i did not go neuchatel he came but once year mountain colonel pury why did i not go neuchatel this proceeded from childishness upon which i must not be silent although protected by king prussia lord marshal while i avoided persecution my asylum i did not avoid murmurs public municipal magistrates ministers after what had happened france it became fashionable insult me these people would have been afraid seem disapprove what my persecutors had done by not imitating them classe neuchatel that is ministers that city gave impulse by endeavoring move council state against me this attempt not having succeeded ministers addressed themselves municipal magistrate who immediately prohibited my book treating me on all occasions with but little civility saying that had i wished reside city i should not have been suffered do it they filled their mercury with absurdities most stupid hypocrisy which although it makes every man sense laugh animated people against me this however did not prevent them from setting forth that i ought be very grateful for their permitting me live at motiers where they had no authority they would willingly have measured me air by pint provided i had paid for it dear price they would have it that i was obliged them for protection king granted me spite efforts they incessantly made deprive me it finally failing success after having done me all injury they could defamed me utmost their power they made merit their impotence by boasting their goodness suffering me stay their country i ought have laughed at their vain efforts but i was foolish enough be vexed at them had weakness be unwilling go neuchatel which i yielded for almost two years as if it was not doing too much honor such wretches pay attention their proceedings which good or bad could not be imputed them because they never act but from foreign impulse besides minds without sense or knowledge whose objects esteem are influence power money far from imagining even that some respect is due talents that it is dishonorable injure insult them certain mayor village who from sundry malversations had been deprived his office said lieutenant val de travers husband isabella i am told this rousseau has great wit bring him me that i may see whether he has or not disapprobation such man ought certainly have no effect upon those on whom it falls after treatment i had received at paris geneva berne even at neuchatel i expected no favor from pastor this place i had however been recommended him by madam boy de la tour he had given me good reception but that country where every new comer is indiscriminately flattered civilities signify but little yet after my solemn union with reformed church living protestant country i could not without failing my engagements as well as duty citizen neglect public profession religion into which i had entered i therefore attended divine service on other hand had i gone holy table i was afraid exposing myself refusal it was by no means probable that after tumult excited at geneva by council at neuchatel by classe ministers he would without difficulty administer me sacrament his church time communion approaching i wrote m de montmollin minister prove him my desire communicating declaring myself heartily united protestant church i also told him order avoid disputing upon articles faith that i would not hearken any particular explanation point doctrine after taking these steps i made myself easy not doubting but m de montmollin would refuse admit me without preliminary discussion which i refused consent that this manner everything would be at end without any fault mine i was deceived when i least expected anything kind m de montmollin came declare me not only that he admitted me communion under condition which i had proposed but that he elders thought themselves much honored by my being one their flock i never my whole life felt greater surprise or received from it more consolation living always alone unconnected appeared me melancholy destiny especially adversity midst so many proscriptions persecutions i found it extremely agreeable be able say myself i am at least amongst my brethren i went communion with emotion heart my eyes suffused with tears tenderness which perhaps were most agreeable preparation him whose table i was drawing near sometime afterwards his lordship sent me letter from madam de boufflers which he had received at least i presumed so by means d alembert who was acquainted with marechal this letter first this lady had written me after my departure from montmorency she rebuked me severely for having written m de montmollin especially for having communicated i less understood what she meant by her reproof as after my journey geneva i had constantly declared myself protestant had gone publicly hotel de hollande without incurring least censure from anybody it appeared me diverting enough that madam de boufflers should wish direct my conscience matters religion however as i had no doubt purity her intention i was not offended by this singular sally i answered her without anger stating her my reasons calumnies print were still industriously circulated their benign authors reproached different powers with treating me too mildly for my part i let them say write what they pleased without giving myself least concern about matter i was told there was censure from sorbonne but this i could not believe what could sorbonne have do matter did doctors wish know certainty that i was not catholic everybody already knew i was not one were they desirous proving i was not good calvinist what consequence was this them it was taking upon themselves singular care becoming substitutes our ministers before i saw this publication i thought it was distributed name sorbonne by way mockery when i had read it i was convinced this was case but when at length there was not doubt its authenticity all i could bring myself believe was that learned doctors would have been better placed madhouse than they were college i was more affected by another publication because it came from man for whom i always had esteem whose constancy i admired though i pitied his blindness i mean mandatory letter against me by archbishop paris i thought return answer it was duty i owed myself this i felt i could do without derogating from my dignity case was something similar that king poland i had always detested brutal disputes after manner voltaire i never combat but with dignity before i deign defend myself i must be certain that he by whom i am attacked will not dishonor my retort i had no doubt but this letter was fabricated by jesuits although they were at that time distress i discovered it their old principle crushing wretched i was therefore at liberty follow my ancient maxim by honoring titulary author refuting work which i think i did completely i found my residence at motiers very agreeable nothing was wanting determine me end my days there but certainty means subsistence living is dear that neighborhood all my old projects had been overturned by dissolution my household arrangements at montmorency establishment others sale or squandering my furniture expenses incurred since my departure little capital which remained me daily diminished two or three years were sufficient consume remainder without my having means renewing it except by again engaging literary pursuits pernicious profession which i had already abandoned persuaded that everything which concerned me would change that public recovered from its frenzy would make my persecutors blush all my endeavors tended prolong my resources until this happy revolution should take place after which i should more at my ease choose resource from amongst those which might offer themselves this effect i took up my dictionary music which ten years labor had so far advanced as leave nothing wanting it but last corrections my books which i had lately received enabled me finish this work my papers sent me by same conveyance furnished me with means beginning my memoirs which i was determined give my whole attention i began by transcribing letters into book by which my memory might be guided order fact time i had already selected those i intended keep for this purpose for ten years series was not interrupted however preparing them for copying i found interruption at which i was surprised this was for almost six months from october 1756 march following i recollected having put into my selection number letters from diderot de leyre madam d epinay madam de chenonceaux etc which filled up void were missing what was become them had any person laid their hands upon my papers whilst they remained hotel de luxembourg this was not conceivable i had seen m de luxembourg take key chamber which i had deposited them many letters from different ladies all those from diderot were without date on which account i had been under necessity dating them from memory before they could be put order thinking i might have committed errors i again looked them over for purpose seeing whether or not i could find those which ought fill up void this experiment did not succeed i perceived vacancy be real that letters had certainly been taken away by whom for what purpose this was what i could not comprehend these letters written prior my great quarrels at time my first enthusiasm composition eloisa could not be interesting any person they contained nothing more than cavillings by diderot jeerings from de leyre assurances friendship from m de chenonceaux even madam d epinay with whom i was then upon best terms whom were these letters consequence what use were they be put it was not until seven years afterwards that i suspected nature theft deficiency being no longer doubtful i looked over my rough drafts see whether or not it was only one i found several which on account badness my memory made me suppose others multitude my papers those i remarked were that morale sensitive extract adventures lord edward last i confess made me suspect madam de luxembourg la roche her valet de chambre had sent me papers i could think nobody but herself whom this fragment could be consequence but what concern could other give her any more than rest letters missing with which even with evil intentions nothing my prejudice could be done unless they were falsified as for marechal with whose friendship for me invariable integrity i was perfectly acquainted i never could suspect him for moment most reasonable supposition after long tormenting my mind endeavoring discover author theft was that which imputed it d alembert who having thrust himself into company madam de luxembourg might have found means turn over these papers take from amongst them such manuscripts letters as he might have thought proper either for purpose endeavoring embroil me with writer them or appropriate those he should find useful his own private purposes i imagined that deceived by title morale sensitive he might have supposed it be plan real treatise upon materialism with which he would have armed himself against me manner easy be imagined certain that he would soon be undeceived by reading sketch determined quit all literary pursuits these larcenies gave me but little concern they besides were not first same hand had committed upon me without having complained these pilferings i had found his elemens de musique elements music several things taken from what i had written for encyclopedie which were given him several years before publication his elements i know not what he may have had do with book entitled dictionaire des beaux arts dictionary fine arts but i found it articles transcribed word for word from mine this long before same articles were printed encyclopedie very little time i thought no more trick that had been played me than if nothing had happened began collect materials i had left for purpose undertaking my projected confessions i had long thought company ministers or at least citizens burgesses geneva would remonstrate against infraction edict decree made against me everything remained quiet at least all exterior appearance for discontent was general ready on first opportunity openly manifest itself my friends or persons calling themselves such wrote letter after letter exhorting me come put myself at their head assuring me public separation from council fear disturbance troubles which might be caused by my presence prevented me from acquiescing with their desires faithful oath i had formerly made never take least part any civil dissension my country i chose rather let offence remain as it was banish myself forever from country than return it by means which were violent dangerous it is true i expected burgesses would make legal remonstrances against infraction which their interests were deeply concerned but no such steps were taken they who conducted body citizens sought less real redress grievances than opportunity render themselves necessary they caballed but were silent suffered me be bespattered by gossips hypocrites set on render me odious eyes populace pass off their misdemeanors as religious zeal after having during whole year vainly expected that some one would remonstrate against illegal proceeding seeing myself abandoned by my fellow citizens i determined renounce my ungrateful country which i never had lived from which i had not received either inheritance or services by which return for honor i had endeavored do it i saw myself so unworthily treated by unanimous consent since they who should have spoken had remained silent i therefore wrote first syndic for that year m favre if i remember right letter which i solemnly gave up my freedom city geneva carefully observing it however that decency moderation from which i have never departed acts haughtiness which my misfortunes cruelty my enemies have frequently forced upon me this step opened eyes citizens who feeling they had neglected their own interests by abandoning my defence took my part when it was too late they had wrongs their own which they joined mine made these subject several well reasoned representations which they strengthened extended as refusal council supported by ministry france made them more clearly perceive project formed impose on them yoke these altercations produced several pamphlets which were undecisive until that appeared entitled lettres ecrites de la campagne work written favor council with infinite art by which remonstrating party reduced silence was crushed for time this production lasting monument rare talents its author came from attorney general tronchin man wit enlightened understanding well versed laws government republic siluit terra remonstrators recovered from their first overthrow undertook give answer time produced one which brought them off tolerably well but they all looked me as only person capable combating like adversary with hope success i confess i was their opinion excited by my former fellow citizens who thought it was my duty aid them with my pen as i had been cause their embarrassment i undertook refute lettres ecrites de la campagne parodied title them by that lettres ecrites de la montagne which i gave mine i wrote this answer so secretly that at meeting i had at thonon with chiefs malcontents talk their affairs where they showed me sketch their answer i said not word mine which was quite ready fearing obstacles might arise relative impression it should magistrate or my enemies hear what i had done this work was however known france before publication but government chose rather let it appear than suffer me guess at means by which my secret had been discovered concerning this i will state what i know which is but trifling what i have conjectured shall remain with myself i received at motiers almost as many visits as at hermitage montmorency but these for most part were different kind they who had formerly come see me were people who having taste talents principles something similar mine alleged them as causes their visits introduced subjects on which i could converse at motiers case was different especially with visitors who came from france they were officers or other persons who had no taste for literature nor had many them read my works although according their own accounts they had travelled thirty forty sixty even hundred leagues come see me admire illustrious man very celebrated great man etc for from time my settling at motiers i received most impudent flattery from which esteem those with whom i associated had formerly sheltered me as but few my new visitors deigned tell me who or what they were as they had neither read nor cast their eye over my works nor had their researches mine been directed same objects i knew not what speak them upon i waited for what they had say because it was for them know tell me purpose their visit it will naturally be imagined this did not produce conversations very interesting me although they perhaps were so my visitors according information they might wish acquire for as i was without suspicion i answered without reserve every question they thought proper ask me they commonly went away as well informed as myself particulars my situation i was for example visited this manner by m de feins equerry queen captain cavalry who had patience pass several days at motiers follow me on foot even la ferriere leading his horse by bridle without having with me any point union except our acquaintance with mademoiselle fel that we both played at bilboquet kind cup ball before this i had received another visit much more extraordinary two men arrived on foot each leading mule loaded with his little baggage lodging at inn taking care their mules asking see me by equipage these muleteers they were taken for smugglers news that smugglers were come see me was instantly spread their manner addressing me sufficiently showed they were persons another description but without being smugglers they might be adventurers this doubt kept me for some time on my guard they soon removed my apprehensions one was m de montauban who had title comte de la tour du pin gentleman dauphin other m dastier de carpentras old officer who had his cross st louis his pocket because he could not display it these gentlemen both very amiable were men sense their manner travelling so much my own taste but little like that french gentlemen some measure gained them my attachment which intercourse with them served improve our acquaintance did not end with visit it is still kept up they have since been several times see me not on foot that was very well for first time but more i have seen these gentlemen less similarity have i found between their taste mine i have not discovered their maxims be such as i have ever observed that my writings are familiar them or that there is any real sympathy between them myself what therefore did they want with me why came they see me with such equipage why repeat their visit why were they so desirous having me for their host i did not at that time propose myself these questions but they have sometimes occurred me since won by their advances my heart abandoned itself without reserve especially m dastier with whose open countenance i was more particularly pleased i even corresponded with him when i determined print letters from mountains i thought addressing myself him deceive those by whom my packet was waited for upon road holland he had spoken me good deal perhaps purposely upon liberty press at avignon he offered me his services should i have anything print there i took advantage offer sent him successively by post my first sheets after having kept these for some time he sent them back me because said he no bookseller dared sell them i was obliged have recourse rey taking care send my papers one after other not part with those which succeeded until i had advice reception those already sent before work was published i found it had been seen office ministers d escherny neuchatel spoke me book entitled de l homme de la montagne which d holbach had told him was by me i assured him it was true that i never had written book which bore that title when letters appeared he became furious accused me falsehood although i had told him truth by this means i was certain my manuscript had been read as i could not doubt fidelity rey most rational conjecture seemed be that my packets had been opened at post house another acquaintance i made much about same time but which was begun by letters was that with m laliand nimes who wrote me from paris begging i would send him my profile he said he was want it for my bust marble which le moine was making for him be placed his library if this was pretence invented deceive me it fully succeeded i imagined that man who wished have my bust marble his library had his head full my works consequently my principles that he loved me because his mind was unison with mine it was natural this idea should seduce me i have since seen m laliand i found him very ready render me many trifling services concern himself my little affairs but i have my doubts his having few books he ever read fallen upon any one those i have written i do not know that he has library or that such thing is any use him for bust he has bad figure plaster by le moine from which has been engraved hideous portrait that bears my name as if it bore me some resemblance only frenchman who seemed come see me on account my sentiments his taste for my works was young officer regiment limousin named seguier de st brisson he made figure paris where he still perhaps distinguishes himself by his pleasing talents wit he came once montmorency winter which preceded my catastrophe i was pleased with his vivacity he afterwards wrote me at motiers whether he wished flatter me or that his head was turned with emilius he informed me he was about quit service live independently had begun learn trade carpenter he had elder brother captain same regiment favorite mother who devotee excess directed by i know not what hypocrite did not treat youngest son well accusing him irreligion what was still worse unpardonable crime being connected with me these were grievances on account which he was determined break with his mother adopt manner life which i have just spoken all play part young emilius alarmed at his petulance i immediately wrote him endeavoring make him change his resolution my exhortations were as strong as i could make them they had their effect he returned his duty his mother took back resignation he had given colonel who had been prudent enough make no use it that young man might have time reflect upon what he had done st brisson cured these follies was guilty another less alarming but me not less disagreeable than rest he became author he successively published two or three pamphlets which announced man not devoid talents but i have not reproach myself with having encouraged him by my praises continue write some time afterwards he came see me we made together pilgrimage island st pierre during this journey i found him different from what i saw him at montmorency he had his manner something affected which at first did not much disgust me although i have since thought it his disadvantage he once visited me at hotel de st simon as i passed through paris on my way england i learned there what he had not told me that he lived great world often visited madam de luxembourg whilst i was at trie i never heard from him nor did he so much as make inquiry after me by means his relation mademoiselle seguier my neighbor this lady never seemed favorably disposed towards me word infatuation m de st brisson ended suddenly like connection m de feins but this man owed me nothing former was under obligations me unless follies i prevented him from committing were nothing more than affectation which might very possibly be case i had visits from geneva also delucs father son successively chose me for their attendant sickness father was taken ill on road son was already sick when he left geneva they both came my house ministers relations hypocrites persons every description came from geneva switzerland not like those from france laugh at admire me but rebuke catechise me only person amongst them who gave me pleasure was moultou who passed with me three or four days whom i wished remain much longer most persevering all most obstinate who conquered me by importunity was m d ivernois merchant at geneva french refugee related attorney general neuchatel this man came from geneva motiers twice year on purpose see me remained with me several days together from morning night accompanied me my walks brought me thousand little presents insinuated himself spite me into my confidence intermeddled all my affairs notwithstanding there was not between him myself least similarity ideas inclination sentiment or knowledge i do not believe he ever read book any kind throughout or that he knows upon what subject mine are written when i began herbalize he followed me my botanical rambles without taste for that amusement or having anything say me or i him he had patience pass with me three days public house at goumoins whence by wearying him making him feel how much he wearied me i was hopes driving him away i could not however shake his incredible perseverance nor by any means discover motive it amongst these connections made continued by force i must not omit only one that was agreeable me which my heart was really interested this was that i had with young hungarian who came live at neuchatel from that place motiers few months after i had taken up my residence there he was called by people country baron de sauttern by which name he had been recommended from zurich he was tall well made had agreeable countenance mild social qualities he told everybody gave me also understand that he came neuchatel for no other purpose than that forming his youth virtue by his intercourse with me his physiognomy manner behavior seemed well suited his conversation i should have thought i failed one greatest duties had i turned my back upon young man whom i perceived nothing but what was amiable who sought my acquaintance from so respectable motive my heart knows not how connect itself by halves he soon acquired my friendship all my confidence we were presently inseparable he accompanied me all my walks became fond them i took him marechal who received him with utmost kindness as he was yet unable explain himself french he spoke wrote me latin i answered french this mingling two languages did not make our conversations either less smooth or lively he spoke his family his affairs his adventures court vienna with domestic details which he seemed well acquainted fine during two years which we passed greatest intimacy i found him mildness character proof against everything manners not only polite but elegant great neatness person extreme decency his conversation word all marks man born educated gentleman which rendered him my eyes too estimable not make him dear me at time we were upon most intimate friendly terms d ivernois wrote me from geneva putting me upon my guard against young hungarian who had taken up his residence my neighborhood telling me he was spy whom minister france had appointed watch my proceedings this information was nature alarm me more as everybody advised me guard against machinations persons who were employed keep eye upon my actions entice me into france for purpose betraying me shut mouths once for all these foolish advisers i proposed sauttern without giving him least intimation information i had received journey on foot pontarlier which he consented as soon as we arrived there i put letter from d ivernois into his hands after giving him ardent embrace i said sauttern has no need proof my confidence him but it is necessary i should prove public that i know whom place it this embrace was accompanied with pleasure which persecutors can neither feel themselves nor take away from oppressed i will never believe sauttern was spy nor that he betrayed me but i was deceived by him when i opened him my heart without reserve he constantly kept his own shut abused me by lies he invented i know not what kind story prove me his presence was necessary his own country i exhorted him return it as soon as possible he set off when i thought he was hungary i learned he was at strasbourgh this was not first time he had been there he had caused some disorder family that city husband knowing i received him my house wrote me i used every effort bring young woman back paths virtue sauttern his duty when i thought they were perfectly detached from each other they renewed their acquaintance husband had complaisance receive young man at his house from that moment i had nothing more say i found pretended baron had imposed upon me by great number lies his name was not sauttern but sauttersheim with respect title baron given him switzerland i could not reproach him with impropriety because he had never taken it but i have not doubt his being gentleman marshal who knew mankind had been hungary always considered treated him as such he had no sooner left my neighborhood than girl at inn where he ate at motiers declared herself with child by him she was so dirty creature sauttern generally esteemed country for his conduct purity morals piqued himself so much upon cleanliness that everybody was shocked at this impudent pretension most amiable women country who had vainly displayed him their charms were furious i myself was almost choked with indignation i used every effort get tongue this impudent woman stopped offering pay all expenses give security for sauttersheim i wrote him fullest persuasion not only that this pregnancy could not relate him but that it was feigned whole machination his enemies mine i wished him return confound strumpet those by whom she was dictated pusillanimity his answer surprised me he wrote master parish which creature belonged endeavored stifle matter perceiving this i concerned myself no more about it but i was astonished that man who could stoop so low should have been sufficiently master himself deceive me by his reserve closest familiarity from strasbourgh sauttersheim went seek his fortune paris found there nothing but misery he wrote me acknowledging his error my compassion was excited by recollection our former friendship i sent him sum money year following as i passed through paris i saw him much same situation but he was intimate friend m de laliand i could not learn by what means he had formed this acquaintance or whether it was recent or long standing two years afterwards sauttersheim returned strasbourgh whence he wrote me where he died this few words is history our connection what i know his adventures but while i mourn fate unhappy young man i still ever shall believe he was son people distinction impropriety his conduct was effect situations which he was reduced such were connections acquaintance i acquired at motiers how many these would have been necessary compensate cruel losses i suffered at same time first these was that m de luxembourg who after having been long tormented by physicians at length became their victim by being treated for gout which they would not acknowledge him have as for disorder they thought they could cure according what la roche confidential servant madam de luxembourg wrote me relative what had happened it is by this cruel memorable example that miseries greatness are be deplored loss this good nobleman afflicted me more as he was only real friend i had france mildness his character was such as make me quite forget his rank attach myself him as his equal our connection was not broken off on account my having quitted kingdom he continued write me as usual i nevertheless thought i perceived that absence or my misfortune had cooled his affection for me it is difficult courtier preserve same attachment person whom he knows be disgrace with courts i moreover suspected great ascendancy madam de luxembourg had over his mind had been unfavorable me that she had taken advantage our separation injure me his esteem for her part notwithstanding few affected marks regard which daily became less frequent she less concealed change her friendship she wrote me four or five times into switzerland after which she never wrote me again nothing but my prejudice confidence blindness could have prevented my discovering her something more than coolness towards me guy bookseller partner with duchesne who after i had left montmorency frequently went hotel de luxembourg wrote me that my name was will marechal there was nothing this either incredible or extraordinary on which account i had no doubt truth information i deliberated within myself whether or not i should receive legacy everything well considered i determined accept it whatever it might be do that honor memory honest man who rank which friendship is seldom found had had real one for me i had not this duty fulfill i heard no more legacy whether it were true or false truth i should have felt some pain offending against one great maxims my system morality profiting by anything at death person whom i had once held dear during last illness our friend mussard leneips proposed me take advantage grateful sense he expressed for our cares insinuate him dispositions our favor ah my dear leneips said i let us not pollute by interested ideas sad but sacred duties we discharge towards our dying friend i hope my name will never be found testament any person at least not that friend it was about this time that my lord marshal spoke me his what he intended do it for me that i made him answer which i have spoken first part my memoirs my second loss still more afflicting irreparable was that best women mothers who already weighed down with years overburthened with infirmities misery quitted this vale tears for abode blessed where amiable remembrance good we have done here below is eternal reward our benevolence go gentle beneficent shade those fenelon bernex catinat others who more humble state have like them opened their hearts pure charity go taste fruit your own benevolence prepare for your son place he hopes fill by your side happy your misfortunes that heaven putting them period has spared you cruel spectacle his fearing lest i should fill her heart with sorrow by recital my first disasters i had not written her since my arrival switzerland but i wrote m de conzie inquire after her situation it was from him i learned she had ceased alleviate sufferings afflicted that her own were at end i myself shall not suffer long but if i thought i should not see her again life come my feeble imagination would less delight idea perfect happiness i there hope enjoy my third last loss for since that time i have not had friend lose was that lord marshal he did not die but tired serving ungrateful he left neuchatel i have never seen him since he still lives will i hope survive me he is alive thanks him all my attachments on earth are not destroyed there is one man still worthy my friendship for real value this consists more what we feel than that which we inspire but i have lost pleasure i enjoyed his can rank him number those only whom i love but with whom i am no longer connected he went england receive pardon king acquired possession property which formerly had been confiscated we did not separate without intention again being united idea which seemed give him as much pleasure as i received from it he determined reside at keith hall near aberdeen i was join him as soon as he was settled there but this project was too flattering my hopes give me any its success he did not remain scotland affectionate solicitations king prussia induced him return berlin reason my not going him there will presently appear before this departure foreseeing storm which my enemies began raise against me he his own accord sent me letters naturalization which seemed be certain means preventing me from being driven from country community convent val de travers followed example governor gave me letters communion gratis as they were first thus every respect become citizen i was sheltered from legal expulsion even by prince but it has never been by legitimate means that man who all others has shown greatest respect for laws has been persecuted i do not think i ought enumerate amongst number my losses at this time that abbe malby having lived sometime at house his mother i have been acquainted with abbe but not very intimately i have reason believe nature his sentiments with respect me changed after i acquired greater celebrity than he already had but first time i discovered his insincerity was immediately after publication letters from mountain letter attributed him addressed madam saladin was handed about geneva which he spoke this work as seditious clamors furious demagogue esteem i had for abbe malby my great opinion his understanding did not permit me believe this extravagant letter was written by him i acted this business with my usual candor i sent him copy letter informing him he was said be author it he returned me no answer this silence astonished me but what was my surprise when by letter i received from madam de chenonceaux i learned abbe was really author that which was attributed him found himself greatly embarrassed by mine for even supposing for moment that what he stated was true how could he justify so public attack wantonly made without obligation or necessity for sole purpose overwhelming midst his greatest misfortunes man whom he had shown himself well wisher who had not done anything that could excite his enmity short time afterwards dialogues phocion which i perceived nothing but compilation without shame or restraint from my writings made their appearance reading this book i perceived author had not least regard for me that future i must number him among my most bitter enemies i do not believe he has ever pardoned me for social contract far superior his abilities or perpetual peace i am besides opinion that desire he expressed that i should make extract from abbe de st pierre proceeded from supposition him that i should not acquit myself it so well further i advance my narrative less order i feel myself capable observing agitation rest my life has deranged my ideas succession events these are too numerous confused disagreeable be recited due order only strong impression they have left upon my mind is that horrid mystery by which cause them is concealed deplorable state which they have reduced me my narrative will future be irregular according events which without order may occur my recollection i remember about time which i refer full idea my confessions i very imprudently spoke them everybody never imagining it could be wish or interest much less within power any person whatsoever throw obstacle way this undertaking had i suspected it even this would not have rendered me more discreet as from nature my disposition it is totally impossible for me conceal either my thoughts or feelings knowledge this enterprise was as far as i can judge cause storm that was raised drive me from switzerland deliver me into hands those by whom i might be prevented from executing it i had another project contemplation which was not looked upon with more favorable eye by those who were afraid first this was general edition my works i thought this edition them necessary ascertain what books amongst those which my name was affixed were really written by me furnish public with means distinguishing them from writings falsely attributed me by my enemies bring me dishonor contempt this was besides simple honorable means insuring myself livelihood only one that remained me as i had renounced profession author my memoirs not being nature appear during my lifetime as i no longer gained farthing any manner whatsoever constantly lived at certain expense i saw end my resources that produce last things i had written this reason had induced me hasten finishing my dictionary music which still was incomplete i had received for it hundred louis guineas life annuity three hundred livres but hundred louis could not last long hands man who annually expended upwards sixty three hundred livres twelve guineas year was but trifling sum one upon whom parasites beggarly visitors lighted like swarm flies company merchants from neuchatel came undertake general edition printer or bookseller name reguillat from lyons thrust himself i know not by what means amongst them direct it agreement was made upon reasonable terms sufficient accomplish my object i had print manuscript matter for six volumes quarto i moreover agreed give my assistance bringing out edition merchants were on their part pay me thousand crowns one hundred twenty five pounds down assign me annuity sixteen hundred livres sixty six pounds for life agreement was concluded but not signed when letters from mountain appeared terrible explosion caused by this infernal work its abominable author terrified company undertaking was at end i would compare effect this last production that letter on french music had not that letter while it brought upon me hatred exposed me danger acquired me respect esteem but after appearance last work it was matter astonishment at geneva versailles that such monster as author it should be suffered exist little council excited by french resident directed by attorney general made declaration against my work by which most severe terms it was declared be unworthy being burned by hands hangman adding with address which bordered upon burlesque there was no possibility speaking or answering it without dishonor i would here transcribe curious piece composition but unfortunately i have it not by me i ardently wish some my readers animated by zeal truth equity would read over letters from mountain they will i dare hope feel stoical moderation which reigns throughout whole after all cruel outrages with which author was loaded but unable answer abuse because no part it could be called by that name nor reasons because these were unanswerable my enemies pretended appear too much enraged reply it is true if they took invincible arguments it contains for abuse they must have felt themselves roughly treated remonstrating party far from complaining odious declaration acted according spirit it instead making trophy letters from mountain which they veiled make them serve as shield were pusillanimous enough not do justice or honor that work written defend them at their own solicitation they did not either quote or mention letters although they tacitly drew from them all their arguments by exactly following advice with which they conclude made them sole cause their safety triumph they had imposed on me this duty i had fulfilled it unto end had served their cause country i begged them abandon me their quarrels think nobody but themselves they took me at my word i concerned myself no more about their affairs further than constantly exhort them peace not doubting should they continue be obstinate their being crushed by france this however did not happen i know reason why it did not but this is not place explain what i mean effect produced at neuchatel by letters from mountain was at first very mild i sent copy them m de montmollin who received it favorably read it without making any objection he was ill as well as myself as soon as he recovered he came friendly manner see me conversed on general subjects rumor was however begun book was burned i know not where from geneva berne perhaps from versailles effervescence quickly passed neuchatel especially val de travers where before even ministers had taken any apparent steps attempt was secretly made stir up people i ought i dare assert have been beloved by people that country which i have lived giving alms abundance not leaving about me indigent person without assistance never refusing do any service my power which was consistent with justice making myself perhaps too familiar with everybody avoiding as far as it was possible for me do it all distinction which might excite least jealousy this however did not prevent populace secretly stirred up against me by i know not whom from being by degrees irritated against me even fury nor from publicly insulting me not only country upon road but street those whom i had rendered greatest services became most irritated against me even people who still continued receive my benefactions not daring appear excited others seemed wish thus be revenged me for their humiliation by obligations they were under for favors i had conferred upon them montmollin seemed pay no attention what was passing did not yet come forward but as time communion approached he came advise me not present myself at holy table assuring me however he was not my enemy that he would leave me undisturbed i found this compliment whimsical enough it brought my recollection letter from madam de boufflers i could not conceive whom it could be matter such importance whether i communicated or not considering this condescension on my part as act cowardice moreover being unwilling give people new pretext under which they might charge me with impiety i refused request minister he went away dissatisfied giving me understand i should repent my obstinacy he could not his own authority forbid me communion that consistory by which i had been admitted it was necessary as long as there was no objection from that body i might present myself without fear being refused montmollin procured from classe ministers commission summon me consistory there give account articles my faith excommunicate me should i refuse comply this excommunication could not be pronounced without aid consistory also majority voices but peasants who under appellation elders composed this assembly presided over governed by their minister might naturally be expected adopt his opinion especially matters clergy which they still less understood than he did i was therefore summoned i resolved appear what happy circumstance triumph would this have been me could i have spoken had i if i may so speak had my pen my mouth with what superiority with what facility even should i have overthrown this poor minister midst his six peasants thirst after power having made protestant clergy forget all principles reformation all i had do recall these their recollection reduce them silence was make comments upon my first letters from mountain upon which they had folly animadvert my text was ready i had only enlarge on it my adversary was confounded i should not have been weak enough remain on defensive it was easy me become assailant without his even perceiving it or being able shelter himself from my attack contemptible priests classe equally careless ignorant had themselves placed me most favorable situation i could desire crush them at pleasure but what this it was necessary i should speak without hesitation find ideas turn expression words at will preserving presence mind keeping myself collected without once suffering even momentary confusion for what could i hope feeling as i did my want aptitude express myself with ease i had been reduced most mortifying silence at geneva before assembly which was favorable me previously resolved approve everything i should say here on contrary i had do with cavalier who substituting cunning knowledge would spread for me hundred snares before i could perceive one them was resolutely determined catch me error let consequence be what it would more i examined situation which i stood greater danger i perceived myself exposed feeling impossibility successfully withdrawing from it i thought another expedient i meditated discourse which i intended pronounce before consistory exempt myself from necessity answering thing was easy i wrote discourse began learn it by memory with inconceivable ardor theresa laughed at hearing me mutter incessantly repeat same phrases while endeavoring cram them into my head i hoped at length remember what i had written i knew chatelain as officer attached service prince would be present at consistory that notwithstanding manoeuvres bottles montmollin most elders were well disposed towards me i had moreover my favor reason truth justice with protection king authority council state good wishes every real patriot whom establishment this inquisition was threatening fine everything contributed encourage me on eve day appointed i had my discourse by rote recited it without missing word i had it my head all night morning i had forgotten it i hesitated at every word thought myself before assembly became confused stammered lost my presence mind fine when time make my appearance was almost at hand my courage totally failed me i remained at home wrote consistory hastily stating my reasons pleaded my disorder which really state which apprehension had reduced me would scarcely have permitted me stay out whole sitting minister embarrassed by my letter adjourned consistory interval he himself by his creatures made thousand efforts seduce elders who following dictates their consciences rather than those they received from him did not vote according his wishes or those classe whatever power his arguments drawn from his cellar might have over this kind people he could not gain one them more than two or three who were already devoted his will who were called his ames damnees damned souls officer prince colonel pury who this affair acted with great zeal kept rest their duty when montmollin wished proceed excommunication his consistory by majority voices flatly refused authorize him do it thus reduced last expedient that stirring up people against me he his colleagues other persons set about it openly were so successful that not withstanding strong frequent rescripts king orders council state i was at length obliged quit country that i might not expose officer king be himself assassinated while he protected me recollection whole this affair is so confused that it is impossible for me reduce or connect circumstances it i remember kind negotiation had been entered into with classe which montmollin was mediator he feigned believe it was feared i should by my writings disturb peace country which case liberty i had writing would be blamed he had given me understand that if i consented lay down my pen what was past would be forgotten i had already entered into this engagement with myself did not hesitate doing it with classe but conditionally solely matters religion he found means have duplicate agreement upon some change necessary be made it condition having been rejected by classe i demanded back writing which was returned me but he kept duplicate pretending it was lost after this people openly excited by ministers laughed at rescripts king orders council state shook off all restraint i was declaimed against from pulpit called antichrist pursued country like mad wolf my armenian dress discovered me populace this i felt cruel inconvenience but quit it such circumstances appeared me act cowardice i could not prevail upon myself do it i quietly walked through country with my caffetan fur bonnet midst hootings dregs people sometimes through shower stones several times as i passed before houses i heard those by whom they were inhabited call out bring me my gun that i may fire at him as i did not on this account hasten my pace my calmness increased their fury but they never went further than threats at least with respect firearms during fermentation i received from two circumstances most sensible pleasure first was my having it my power prove my gratitude by means lord marshal honest part inhabitants neuchatel full indignation at treatment i received manoeuvres which i was victim held ministers execration clearly perceiving they were obedient foreign impulse vile agents people who making them act kept themselves concealed they were moreover afraid my case would have dangerous consequences be made precedent for purpose establishing real inquisition magistrates especially m meuron who had succeeded m d ivernois office attorney general made every effort defend me colonel pury although private individual did more succeeded better it was colonel who found means make montmollin submit his consistory by keeping elders their duty he had credit employed it stop sedition but he had nothing more than authority laws aid justice reason oppose that money wine combat was unequal this point montmollin was triumphant however thankful for his zeal cares i wished have it my power make him return good offices some measure discharge part obligations i was under him i knew he was very desirous being named counsellor state but having displeased court by his conduct affair minister petitpierre he was disgrace with prince governor i however undertook at all risks write lord marshal his favor i went so far as even mention employment which he was desirous my application was so well received that contrary expectations his most ardent well wishers it was almost instantly conferred upon him by king this manner fate which has constantly raised me too great elevation or plunged me into abyss adversity continued toss me from one extreme another whilst populace covered me with mud i was able make counsellor state other pleasing circumstance was visit i received from madam de verdelin with her daughter with whom she had been at baths bourbonne whence they came motiers stayed with me two or three days by her attention cares she at length conquered my long repugnancy my heart won by her endearing manner made her return all friendship which she had long given me proofs this journey made me extremely sensible her kindness my situation rendered consolations friendship highly necessary support me under my sufferings i was afraid she would be too much affected by insults i received from populace could have wished conceal them from her that her feelings might not be hurt but this was impossible although her presence was some check upon insolent populace our walks she saw enough their brutality enable her judge what passed when i was alone during short residence she made at motiers i was still attacked my habitation one morning her chambermaid found my window blocked up with stones which had been thrown at it during night very heavy bench placed street by side house strongly fastened down was taken up reared against door such manner as had it not been perceived from window have knocked down first person who should have opened door go out madam de verdelin was acquainted with everything that passed for besides what she herself was witness her confidential servant went into many houses village spoke everybody was seen conversation with montmollin she did not however seem pay least attention that which happened me nor never mentioned montmollin nor any other person answered few words what i said her him persuaded that residence england would be more agreeable me than any other she frequently spoke mr hume who was then at paris his friendship for me desire he had being service me his own country it is time i should say something hume he had acquired great reputation france amongst encyclopedists by his essays on commerce politics last place by his history house stuart only one his writings which i had read part translation abbe prevot for want being acquainted with his other works i was persuaded according what i heard him that mr hume joined very republican mind english paradoxes favor luxury this opinion i considered his whole apology charles i as prodigy impartiality i had as great idea his virtue as his genius desire being acquainted with this great man obtaining his friendship had greatly strengthened inclination i felt go england induced by solicitations madam de boufflers intimate friend hume after my arrival switzerland i received from him by means this lady letter extremely flattering which highest encomiums on my genius he subjoined pressing invitation induce me go england offer all his interest that his friends make my residence there agreeable i found country which i had retired lord marshal countryman friend hume who confirmed my good opinion him from whom i learned literary anecdote which did him great honor opinion his lordship had same effect mine wallace who had written against hume upon subject population ancients was absent whilst his work was press hume took upon himself examine proofs do needful edition this manner acting was according my way thinking i had sold at six sous three pence piece copies song written against myself i was therefore strongly prejudiced favor hume when madam de verdelin came mentioned lively friendship he expressed for me his anxiety do me honors england such was her expression she pressed me good deal take advantage this zeal write him as i had not naturally inclination england did not intend go there until last extremity i refused write or make any promise but i left her at liberty do whatever she should think necessary keep mr hume favorably disposed towards me when she went from motiers she left me persuasion by everything she had said me that illustrious man that he was my friend she herself still more his after her departure montmollin carried on his manoeuvres with more vigor populace threw off all restraint yet i still continued walk quietly amidst hootings vulgar taste for botany which i had begun contract with doctor d ivernois making my rambling more amusing i went through country herbalising without being affected by clamors this scum earth whose fury was still augmented by my calmness what affected me most was seeing families my friends or persons who gave themselves that name openly join league my persecutors such as d ivernois without excepting father brother my isabel le boy de la tour relation friend whose house i lodged madam girardier her sister law this fatality had begun with my residence at yverdon banneret roguin dying year or two after my departure from that city old papa roguin had candor inform me with grief as he said that papers his relation proofs had been found his having been concerned conspiracy expel me from yverdon state berne this clearly proved conspiracy not be as some people pretended believe affair hypocrisy since banneret far from being devotee carried materialism incredulity intolerance fanaticism besides nobody at yverdon had shown me more constant attention nor had so prodigally bestowed upon me praises flattery as this banneret he faithfully followed favorite plan my persecutors this peter boy was such brute so stupid behaved so uncouthly that prevent my mind from being disturbed i took liberty ridicule him after manner petit prophete i wrote pamphlet few pages entitled la vision de pierre de la montagne dit le voyant vision peter mountain called seer which i found means be diverting enough on miracles which then served as great pretext for my persecution du peyrou had this scrap printed at geneva but its success country was but moderate neuchatelois with all their wit taste but weakly attic salt or pleasantry when these are little refined midst decrees persecutions genevese had distinguished themselves by setting up hue cry with all their might my friend vernes amongst others with heroical generosity chose that moment precisely publish against me letters which he pretended prove i was not christian these letters written with air self sufficiency were not better for it although it was positively said celebrated bonnet had given them some correction for this man although materialist has intolerant orthodoxy moment i am question there certainly was nothing this work which could tempt me answer it but having opportunity saying few words upon it my letters from mountain i inserted them short note sufficiently expressive disdain render vernes furious he filled geneva with his furious exclamations d ivernois wrote me word he had quite lost his senses sometime afterwards appeared anonymous sheet which instead ink seemed be written with water phlegethon this letter i was accused having exposed my children streets taking about with me soldier s trull being worn out with debaucheries other fine things like nature it was not difficult for me discover author my first idea on reading this libel was reduce its real value everything world calls fame reputation amongst men seeing thus man who was never brothel his life whose greatest defect was being as timid shy as virgin treated as frequenter places that description finding myself charged with being i who not only never had least taint such disorder but according faculty was so constructed as make it almost impossible for me contract it everything well considered i thought i could not better refute this libel than by having it printed city which i longest resided with this intention i sent it duchesne print it as it was with advertisement which i named m vernes few short notes by way eclaircissement not satisfied with printing it only i sent copies several persons amongst others one copy prince louis wirtemberg who had made me polite advances with whom i was correspondence prince du peyrou others seemed have their doubts about author libel blamed me for having named vernes upon so slight foundation their remarks produced me some scruples i wrote duchesne suppress paper guy wrote me he had suppressed it this may or may not be case i have been deceived on so many occasions that there would be nothing extraordinary my being so on this from time which i speak was so enveloped profound darkness that it was impossible for me come at any kind truth m vernes bore imputation with moderation more than astonishing man who was supposed not have deserved it after fury with which he was seized on former occasions he wrote me two or three letters very guarded terms with view as it appeared me endeavor by my answers discover how far i was certain his being author paper whether or not i had any proofs against him i wrote him two short answers severe sense but politely expressed with which he was not displeased his third letter perceiving he wished form with me kind correspondence i returned no answer he got d ivernois speak me madam cramer wrote du peyrou telling him she was certain libel was not by vernes this however did not make me change my opinion but as it was possible i might be deceived as it is certain that if i were i owed vernes explicit reparation i sent him word by d ivernois that i would make him such one as he should think proper provided he would name me real author libel or at least prove that he himself was not so i went further feeling that after all were he not culpable i had no right call upon him for proofs any kind i stated memoir considerable length reasons whence i had inferred my conclusion determined submit them judgment arbitrator against whom vernes could not except but few people would guess arbitrator whom i made choice i declared at end memoir that if after having examined it made such inquiries as should seem necessary council pronounced m vernes not be author libel from that moment i should be fully persuaded he was not would immediately go throw myself at his feet ask his pardon until i had obtained it i can say with greatest truth that my ardent zeal for equity uprightness generosity my heart my confidence love justice innate every mind never appeared more fully perceptible than this wise interesting memoir which i took without hesitation my most implacable enemies for arbitrators between calumniator myself i read du peyrou what i had written he advised me suppress it i did so he wished me wait for proofs vernes promised i am still waiting for them he thought it best that i should meantime be silent i held my tongue shall do so rest my life censured as i am for having brought against vernes heavy imputation false unsupportable by proof although i am still fully persuaded nay as convinced as i am my existence that he is author libel my memoir is hands du peyrou should it ever be published my reasons will be found it heart jean jacques with which my contemporaries would not be acquainted will i hope be known i have now proceed my catastrophe at motiers my departure from val de travers after residence two years half eight months suffering with unshaken constancy most unworthy treatment it is impossible for me clearly recollect circumstances this disagreeable period but detail them will be found publication that effect by du peyrou which i shall hereafter have occasion speak after departure madam de verdelin fermentation increased notwithstanding reiterated rescripts king frequent orders council state cares chatelain magistrates place people seriously considering me as antichrist perceiving all their clamors be no effect seemed at length determined proceed violence stones were already thrown after me roads but i was however general at too great distance receive any harm from them at last night fair motiers which is beginning september i was attacked my habitation such manner as endanger lives everybody house at midnight i heard great noise gallery which ran along back part house shower stones thrown against window door which opened gallery fell into it with so much noise violence that my dog which usually slept there had begun bark ceased from fright ran into corner gnawing scratching planks endeavor make his escape i immediately rose was preparing go from my chamber into kitchen when stone thrown by vigorous arm crossed latter after having broken window forced open door my chamber fell at my feet so that had i been moment sooner upon floor i should have had stone against my stomach i judged noise had been made bring me door stone thrown receive me as i went out i ran into kitchen where i found theresa who also had risen was tremblingly making her way me as fast as she could we placed ourselves against wall out direction window avoid stones deliberate upon what was best be done for going out call assistance was certain means getting ourselves knocked on head fortunately maid servant old man who lodged under me was waked by noise got up ran call chatelain whose house was next mine he jumped from his bed put on his robe de chambre instantly came me with guard which on account fair went round that night was just at hand chatelain was so alarmed at sight effects what had happened that he turned pale on seeing stones gallery exclaimed good god here is quarry on examining below stairs door little court was found have been forced there was appearance attempt having been made get into house by gallery on inquiring reason why guard had neither prevented nor perceived disturbance it came out that guards motiers had insisted upon doing duty that night although it was turn those another village next day chatelain sent his report council state which two days afterwards sent order inquire into affair promise reward secrecy those who should impeach such as were guilty meantime place at expense king guards about my house that chatelain which joined it day after disturbance colonel pury attorney general meuron chatelain martinet receiver guyenet treasurer d ivernois his father word every person consequence country came see me united their solicitations persuade me yield storm leave at least for time place which i could no longer live safety nor with honor i perceived that even chatelain was frightened at fury people apprehending it might extend himself would be glad see me depart as soon as possible that he might no longer have trouble protecting me there be able quit parish which he did after my departure i therefore yielded their solicitations this with but little pain for hatred people so afflicted my heart that i was no longer able support it i had choice places retire after madam de verdelin returned paris she had several letters mentioned mr walpole whom she called my lord who having strong desire serve me proposed me asylum at one his country houses situation which she gave me most agreeable description entering relative lodging subsistence into detail which proved she lord walpole had held particular consultations upon project my lord marshal had always advised me go england or scotland case my determining upon latter offered me there asylum but he offered me another at potsdam near his person which tempted me more than all rest he had just communicated me what king had said him about my going there which was kind invitation me from that monarch duchess saxe gotha depended so much upon my taking journey that she wrote me desiring i should go see her my way court prussia stay some time before i proceeded farther but i was so attached switzerland that i could not resolve quit it so long as it was possible for me live there i seized this opportunity execute project which i had for several months conceived idea which i have deferred speaking that i might not interrupt my narrative this project consisted going reside island st peter estate belonging hospital berne middle lake bienne pedestrian pilgrimage i had made preceding year with du peyrou we had visited this isle with which i was so much delighted that i had since that time incessantly thought means making it my place residence greatest obstacle my wishes arose from property island being vested people berne who three years before had driven me from amongst them besides mortification returning live with people who had given me so unfavorable reception i had reason fear they would leave me no more at peace island than they had done at yverdon i had consulted lord marshal upon subject who thinking as i did that people berne would be glad see me banished island keep me there as hostage for works i might be tempted write sounded their dispositions by means m sturler his old neighbor at colombier m sturler addressed himself chiefs state according their answer assured marshal bernois sorry for their past behavior wished see me settled island st peter leave me there at peace as additional precaution before i determined reside there i desired colonel chaillet make new inquiries he confirmed what i had already heard receiver island having obtained from his superiors permission lodge me it i thought i might without danger go house with tacit consent sovereign proprietors for i could not expect people berne would openly acknowledge injustice they had done me thus act contrary most inviolable maxim all sovereigns island st peter called at neuchatel island la motte middle lake bienne is half league circumference but this little space all chief productions necessary subsistence are found island has fields meadows orchards woods vineyards all these favored by variegated mountainous situations form distribution more agreeable as parts not being discovered all at once are seen successively advantage make island appear greater than it really is very elevated terrace forms western part it commands gleresse neuverville this terrace is planted with trees which form long alley interrupted middle by great saloon which during vintage people from neighboring shores assemble divert themselves there is but one house whole island but that is very spacious convenient inhabited by receiver situated hollow by which it is sheltered from winds five or six hundred paces south island st peter is another island considerably less than former wild uncultivated which appears have been detached from greater island by storms its gravelly soil produces nothing but willows persicaria but there is it high hill well covered with greensward very pleasant form lake is almost regular oval banks less rich than those lake geneva neuchatel form beautiful decoration especially towards western part which is well peopled edged with vineyards at foot chain mountains something like those cote rotie but which produce not such excellent wine bailiwick st john neuveville berne bienne lie line from south north extremity lake whole interspersed with very agreeable villages such was asylum i had prepared for myself which i was determined retire after quitting val de travers it may perhaps be necessary remark that i left there enemy m du teneaux mayor verrieres not much esteemed country but who has brother said be honest man office m de st florentin mayor had been see him some time before my adventure little remarks this kind though no consequence themselves may lead discovery many underhand dealings this choice was so agreeable my peaceful inclinations my solitary indolent disposition that i consider it as one pleasing reveries which i became most passionately fond i thought i should that island be more separated from men more sheltered from their outrages sooner forgotten by mankind word more abandoned delightful pleasures inaction contemplative life i could have wished have been confined it such manner as have had no intercourse with mortals i certainly took every measure i could imagine relieve me from necessity troubling my head about them great question was that subsistence by dearness provisions difficulty carriage this is expensive island inhabitants are besides at mercy receiver this difficulty was removed by arrangement which du peyrou made with me becoming substitute company which had undertaken abandoned my general edition i gave him all materials necessary made proper arrangement distribution engagement between us i added that giving him memoirs my life made him general depositary all my papers under express condition making no use them until after my death having it at heart quietly end my days without doing anything which should again bring me back recollection public life annuity he undertook pay me was sufficient my subsistence my lord marshal having recovered all his property had offered me twelve hundred livres fifty pounds year half which i accepted he wished send me principal this i refused on account difficulty placing it he then sent amount du peyrou whose hands it remained who pays me annuity according terms agreed upon with his lordship adding therefore result my agreement with du peyrou annuity marshal two thirds which were reversible theresa after my death annuity three hundred livres from duchesne i was assured genteel subsistence for myself after me for theresa whom i left seven hundred livres twenty nine pounds year from annuities paid me by rey lord marshal i had therefore no longer fear want bread but it was ordained that honor should oblige me reject all these resources which fortune my labors placed within my reach that i should die as poor as i had lived it will be seen whether or not without reducing myself last degree infamy i could abide by engagements which care has always taken render ignominious by depriving me every other resource force me consent my own dishonor how was it possible anybody could doubt choice i should make such alternative others have judged my heart by their own my mind at ease relative subsistence was without care upon every other subject although i left world field open my enemies there remained noble enthusiasm by which my writings were dictated constant uniformity my principles evidence uprightness my heart which answered that deducible from my conduct favor my natural disposition i had no need any other defense against my calumniators they might under my name describe another man but it was impossible they should deceive such as were unwilling be imposed upon i could have given them my whole life animadvert upon with certainty notwithstanding all my faults weaknesses my want aptitude support lightest yoke their finding me every situation just good man without bitterness hatred or jealousy ready acknowledge my errors still more prompt forget injuries i received from others seeking all my happiness love friendship affection everything carrying my sincerity even imprudence most incredible disinterestedness i therefore some measure took leave age which i lived my contemporaries bade adieu world with intention confine myself for rest my days that island such was my resolution it was there i hoped execute great project indolent life which i had until then consecrated little activity with which heaven had endowed me island was become me that papimanie that happy country where inhabitants sleep on n y fait plus on n y fait nulle chose there they do no more there they do nothing this no more was everything for me for i never much regretted sleep indolence is sufficient my happiness provided i do nothing i had rather dream waking than asleep being past age romantic projects having been more stunned than flattered by trumpet fame my only hope was that living at ease constantly at leisure this is life blessed world come for rest mine here below i made it my supreme happiness they who reproach me with so many contradictions will not fail here add another number i have observed indolence great companies made them unsupportable me i am now seeking solitude for sole purpose abandoning myself inaction this however is my disposition if there be it contradiction it proceeds from nature not from me but there is so little that it is precisely on that account that i am always consistent indolence company is burdensome because it is forced that solitude is charming because it is free depends upon will company i suffer cruelly by inaction because this is necessity i must there remain nailed my chair or stand upright like picket without stirring hand or foot not daring run jump sing exclaim nor gesticulate when i please not allowed even dream suffering at same time fatigue inaction all torment constraint obliged pay attention every foolish thing uttered all idle compliments paid constantly keep my mind upon rack that i may not fail introduce my turn my jest or my lie this is called idleness it is labor galley slave indolence i love is not that lazy fellow who sits with his arms across total inaction thinks no more than he acts but that child which is incessantly motion doing nothing that dotard who wanders from his subject i love amuse myself with trifles by beginning hundred things never finishing one them by going or coming as i take either into my head by changing my project at every instant by following fly through all its windings wishing overturn rock see what is under it by undertaking with ardor work ten years abandoning it without regret at end ten minutes finally musing from morning until night without order or coherence following everything caprice moment botany such as i have always considered it which after my own manner i began become passionately fond was precisely idle study proper fill up void my leisure without leaving room for delirium imagination or weariness total inaction carelessly wandering woods country mechanically gathering here flower there branch eating my morsel almost by chance observing thousand thousand times same things always with same interest because i always forgot them were me means passing eternity without weary moment however elegant admirable variegated structure plants may be it does not strike ignorant eye sufficiently fix attention constant analogy with at same time prodigious variety which reigns their conformation gives pleasure those only who have already some idea vegetable system others at sight these treasures nature feel nothing more than stupid monotonous admiration they see nothing detail because they know not for what look nor do they perceive whole having no idea chain connection combinations which overwhelms with its wonders mind observer i was arrived at that happy point knowledge my want memory was such as constantly keep me there that i knew little enough make whole new me yet everything that was necessary make me sensible beauties all parts different soils into which island although little was divided offered sufficient variety plants for study amusement my whole life i was determined not leave blade grass without analyzing it i began already take measures for making with immense collection observations flora petrinsularis i sent for theresa who brought with her my books effects we boarded with receiver island his wife had sisters at nidau who by turns came see her were company for theresa i here made experiment agreeable life which i could have wished continue end my days pleasure i found it only served make me feel greater degree bitterness that by which it was shortly be succeeded i have ever been passionately fond water sight it throws me into delightful reverie although frequently without determinate object immediately after i rose from my bed i never failed if weather was fine run terrace respire fresh salubrious air morning glide my eye over horizon lake bounded by banks mountains delightful view i know no homage more worthy divinity than silent admiration excited by contemplation his works which is not externally expressed i can easily comprehend reason why inhabitants great cities who see nothing but walls streets have but little faith but not whence it happens that people country especially such as live solitude can possibly be without it how comes it pass that these do not hundred times day elevate their minds ecstasy author wonders which strike their senses for my part it is especially at rising wearied by want sleep that long habit inclines me this elevation which imposes not fatigue thinking but this effect my eyes must be struck with ravishing beauties nature my chamber i pray less frequently not so fervently but at view fine landscape i feel myself moved but by what i am unable tell i have somewhere read wise bishop who visit his diocese found old woman whose only prayer consisted single interjection oh good mother said he her continue pray this manner your prayer is better than ours this better prayer is mine also after breakfast i hastened with frown on my brow write few pitiful letters longing ardently for moment after which i should have no more write i busied myself for few minutes about my books papers unpack arrange them rather than read what they contained this arrangement which me became work penelope gave me pleasure musing for while i then grew weary quitted my books spend three or four hours which remained me morning study botany especially system linnaeus which i became so passionately fond that after having felt how useless my attachment it was i yet could not entirely shake it off this great observer is my opinion only one who with ludwig has hitherto considered botany as naturalist philosopher but he has too much studied it herbals gardens not sufficiently nature herself for my part whose garden was always whole island moment i wanted make or verify observation i ran into woods or meadows with my book under my arm there laid myself upon ground near plant question examine it at my ease as it stood this method was great service me gaining knowledge vegetables their natural state before they had been cultivated changed their nature by hands men fagon first physician louis xiv who named perfectly knew all plants royal garden is said have been so ignorant country as not know how distinguish same plants i am precisely contrary i know something work nature but nothing that gardener i gave every afternoon totally up my indolent careless disposition following without regularity impulse moment when weather was calm i frequently went immediately after i rose from dinner alone got into boat receiver had taught me row with one oar i rowed out into middle lake moment i withdrew from bank i felt secret joy which almost made me leap which it is impossible for me tell or even comprehend cause if it were not secret congratulation on my being out reach wicked i afterwards rowed about lake sometimes approaching opposite bank but never touching at it i often let my boat float at mercy wind water abandoning myself reveries without object which were not less agreeable for their stupidity i sometimes exclaimed o nature o my mother i am here under thy guardianship alone here is no deceitful cunning mortal interfere between thee me this manner i withdrew half league from land i could have wished lake had been ocean however please my poor dog who was not so fond as i was such long stay on water i commonly followed one constant course this was going land at little island where i walked hour or two or laid myself down on grass on summit hill there satiate myself with pleasure admiring lake its environs examine dissect all herbs within my reach like another robinson crusoe built myself imaginary place residence island i became very much attached this eminence when i brought theresa with wife receiver her sisters walk there how proud was i be their pilot guide we took there rabbits stock it this was another source pleasure jean jacques these animals rendered island still more interesting me i afterwards went it more frequently with greater pleasure observe progress new inhabitants these amusements i added one which recalled my recollection delightful life i led at charmettes which season particularly invited me this was assisting rustic labors gathering roots fruits which theresa i made it pleasure partake with wife receiver his family i remember bernois one m kirkeberguer coming see me found me perched upon tree with sack fastened my waist already so full apples that i could not stir from branch on which i stood i was not sorry be caught this similar situations i hoped people berne witnesses employment my leisure would no longer think disturbing my tranquillity but leave me at peace my solitude i should have preferred being confined there by their desire this would have rendered continuation my repose more certain this is another declaration upon which i am previously certain incredulity many my readers who obstinately continue judge me by themselves although they cannot but have seen course my life thousand internal affections which bore no resemblance any theirs but what is still more extraordinary is that they refuse me every sentiment good or indifferent which they have not are constantly ready attribute me such bad ones as cannot enter into heart man this case they find it easy set me opposition nature make me such monster as cannot reality exist nothing absurd appears them incredible moment it has tendency blacken me nothing least extraordinary seems them possible if it tends do me honor but notwithstanding what they may think or say i will still continue faithfully state what j j rousseau was did thought without explaining or justifying singularity his sentiments ideas or endeavoring discover whether or not others have thought as he did i became so delighted with island st peter my residence there was so agreeable me that by concentrating all my desires within it i formed wish that i might stay there end my life visits i had return neighborhood journeys i should be under necessity making neuchatel bienne yverdon nidau already fatigued my imagination day passed out island seemed me loss so much happiness go beyond bounds lake was go out my element past experience had besides rendered me apprehensive very satisfaction that i received from anything whatever was sufficient make me fear loss it ardent desire i had end my days that island was inseparable from apprehension being obliged leave it i had contracted habit going evening sit upon sandy shore especially when lake was agitated i felt singular pleasure seeing waves break at my feet i formed them my imagination image tumult world contrasted with peace my habitation this pleasing idea sometimes softened me even tears repose i enjoyed with ecstasy was disturbed by nothing but fear being deprived it this inquietude was accompanied with some bitterness i felt my situation so precarious as not dare depend upon its continuance ah how willingly said i myself would i renounce liberty quitting this place for which i have no desire for assurance always remaining it instead being permitted stay here by favor why am i not detained by force they who suffer me remain may moment drive me away can i hope my persecutors seeing me happy will leave me here continue be so permitting me live island is but trifling favor i could wish be condemned do it constrained remain here that i may not be obliged go elsewhere i cast envious eye upon micheli du cret who quiet castle arbourg had only determine be happy become so fine by abandoning myself these reflections alarming apprehensions new storms always ready break over my head i wished for them with incredible ardor that instead suffering me reside island bernois would give it me for perpetual prison i can assert that had it depended upon me get myself condemned this i would most joyfully have done it preferring thousand times necessity passing my life there danger being driven another place this fear did not long remain on my mind when i least expected what was happen i received letter from bailiff nidau within whose jurisdiction island st peter was by his letter he announced me from their excellencies order quit island their states i thought myself dream nothing could be less natural reasonable or foreseen than such order for i considered my apprehensions as result inquietude man whose imagination was disturbed by his misfortunes not proceed from foresight which could have least foundation measures i had taken insure myself tacit consent sovereign tranquillity with which i had been left make my establishment visits several people from berne that bailiff himself who had shown me such friendship attention rigor season which it was barbarous expel man who was sickly infirm all these circumstances made me many people believe that there was some mistake order that ill disposed people had purposely chosen time vintage vacation senate suddenly do me injury had i yielded first impulse my indignation i should immediately have departed but what place was i go what was become me at beginning winter without object preparation guide or carriage not leave my papers effects at mercy first comer time was necessary make proper arrangements it was not stated order whether or not this would be granted me continuance misfortune began weigh down my courage for first time my life i felt my natural haughtiness stoop yoke necessity notwithstanding murmurs my heart i was obliged demean myself by asking for delay i applied m de graffenried who had sent me order for explanation it his letter conceived strongest terms disapprobation step that had been taken assured me it was with greatest regret he communicated me nature it expressions grief esteem it contained seemed so many gentle invitations open him my heart i did so i had no doubt but my letter would open eyes my persecutors that if so cruel order was not revoked at least reasonable delay perhaps whole winter make necessary preparations for my retreat choose place abode would be granted me whilst i waited for answer i reflected upon my situation deliberated upon steps i had take i perceived so many difficulties on all sides vexation i had suffered had so strongly affected me my health was then such bad state that i was quite overcome effect my discouragement was deprive me little resource which remained my mind by which i might as well as it was possible do it have withdrawn myself from my melancholy situation whatever asylum i should take refuge it appeared impossible avoid either two means made use expel me one which was stir up against me populace by secret manoeuvres other drive me away by open force without giving reason for so doing i could not therefore depend upon safe retreat unless i went search it farther than my strength season seemed likely permit these circumstances again bringing my recollection ideas which had lately occurred me i wished my persecutors condemn me perpetual imprisonment rather than oblige me incessantly wander upon earth by successively expelling me from asylums which i should make choice this effect i made them proposal two days after my first letter m de graffenried i wrote him second desiring he would state what i had proposed their excellencies answer from berne both was order conceived most formal severe terms go out island leave every territory mediate immediate republic within space twenty four hours never enter them again under most grievous penalties this was terrible moment i have since that time felt greater anguish but never have i been more embarrassed what afflicted me most was being forced abandon project which had made me desirous pass winter island it is now time i should relate fatal anecdote which completed my disasters involved my ruin unfortunate people whose rising virtues already promised equal those rome sparta i had spoken corsicans social contract as new people only nation europe not too worn out for legislation had expressed great hope there was such people if it were fortunate enough have wise legislator my work was read by some corsicans who were sensible honorable manner which i had spoken them necessity under which they found themselves endeavoring establish their republic made their chiefs think asking me for my ideas upon subject m buttafuoco one first families country captain france royal italians wrote me that effect sent me several papers for which i had asked make myself acquainted with history nation state country m paoli also wrote me several times although i felt such undertaking be superior my abilities i thought i could not refuse give my assistance so great noble work moment i should have acquired all necessary information it was this effect i answered both these gentlemen correspondence lasted until my departure precisely at same time i heard that france was sending troops corsica that she had entered into treaty with genoese this treaty sending troops gave me uneasiness without imagining i had any further relation with business i thought it impossible attempt ridiculous labor at undertaking which required such undisturbed tranquillity as political institution people moment when perhaps they were upon point being subjugated i did not conceal my fears from m buttafuoco who rather relieved me from them by assurance that were there treaty things contrary liberty his country good citizen like himself would not remain as he did service france fact his zeal for legislation corsicans his connections with m paoli could not leave doubt on my mind respecting him when i heard he made frequent journeys versailles fontainebleau had conversations with m de choiseul all i concluded from whole was that with respect real intentions france he had assurances which he gave me understand but concerning which he did not choose openly explain himself by letter this removed part my apprehensions yet as i could not comprehend meaning transportation troops from france nor reasonably suppose they were sent corsica protect liberty inhabitants which they themselves were very well able defend against genoese i could neither make myself perfectly easy nor seriously undertake plan proposed legislation until i had solid proofs that whole was serious that parties meant not trifle with me i much wished for interview with m buttafuoco as that was certainly best means coming at explanation i wished this he gave me hopes i waited for it with greatest impatience i know not whether he really intended me any interview or not but had this even been case my misfortunes would have prevented me from profiting by it more i considered proposed undertaking further i advanced examination papers i had my hands greater i found necessity studying country people for whom institutions were be made soil they inhabited all relative circumstances by which it was necessary appropriate them that institution i daily perceived more clearly impossibility acquiring at distance all information necessary guide me this i wrote m buttafuoco he felt as i did although i did not form precise resolution going corsica i considered good deal means necessary make that voyage i mentioned it m dastier who having formerly served island under m de maillebois was necessarily acquainted with it he used every effort dissuade me from this intention i confess frightful description he gave me corsicans their country considerably abated desire i had going live amongst them but when persecutions motiers made me think quitting switzerland this desire was again strengthened by hope at length finding amongst these islanders repose refused me every other place one thing only alarmed me which was my unfitness for active life which i was going be condemned aversion i had always had it my disposition proper for meditating at leisure solitude was not so for speaking acting treating affairs with men nature which had endowed me with first talent had refused me last yet i felt that even without taking direct active part public affairs i should as soon as i was corsica be under necessity yielding desires people frequently conferring with chiefs object even voyage required that instead seeking retirement i should heart country endeavor gain information which i stood need it was certain that i should no longer be master my own time that spite myself precipitated into vortex which i was not born move i should there lead life contrary my inclination never appear but disadvantage i foresaw that ill supporting by my presence opinion my books might have given corsicans my capacity i should lose my reputation amongst them as much their prejudice as my own be deprived confidence they had me without which however i could not successfully produce work they expected from my pen i am certain that by thus going out my sphere i should become useless inhabitants render myself unhappy tormented beaten by storms from every quarter for several years past fatigued by journeys persecution i strongly felt want repose which my barbarous enemies wantonly deprived me i sighed more than ever after that delicious indolence that soft tranquillity body mind which i had so much desired which now that i had recovered from chimeras love friendship my heart limited its supreme felicity i viewed with terror work i was about undertake tumultuous life into which i was enter made me tremble if grandeur beauty utility object animated my courage impossibility conquering so many difficulties entirely deprived me it twenty years profound meditation solitude would have been less painful me than active life six months midst men public affairs with certainty not succeeding my undertaking i thought expedient which seemed proper obviate every difficulty pursued by underhand dealings my secret persecutors every place which i took refuge seeing no other except corsica where i could my old days hope for repose i had until then been everywhere deprived i resolved go there with directions m buttafuoco as soon as this was possible but live there tranquillity renouncing appearance everything relative legislation some measure make my hosts return for their hospitality confine myself writing country history corsicans with reserve my own mind intention secretly acquiring necessary information become more useful them should i see probability success this manner by not entering into engagement i hoped be enabled better meditate secret more at my ease plan which might be useful their purpose this without much breaking upon my dearly beloved solitude or submitting kind life which i had ever found insupportable but journey was not my situation thing so easy get over according what m dastier had told me corsica i could not expect find there most simple conveniences life except such as i should take with me linen clothes plate kitchen furniture books all were be conveyed thither get there myself with my gouvernante i had alps cross journey two hundred leagues drag after me all my baggage i had also pass through states several sovereigns according example set all europe i had after what had befallen me naturally expect find obstacles every quarter that each sovereign would think he did himself honor by overwhelming me with some new insult violating my person all rights persons humanity immense expense fatigue risk such journey made previous consideration them weighing every difficulty first step necessary idea being alone at my age without resource far removed from all my acquaintance at mercy these semi barbarous ferocious people such as m dastier had described them me was sufficient make me deliberate before i resolved expose myself such dangers i ardently wished for interview for which m buttafuoco had given me reason hope i waited result it guide me my determination whilst i thus hesitated came on persecutions motiers which obliged me retire i was not prepared for long journey especially corsica i expected hear from buttafuoco i took refuge island st peter whence i was driven at beginning winter as i have already stated alps covered with snow then rendered my emigration impracticable especially with promptitude required from me it is true extravagant severity like order rendered execution it almost impossible for midst that concentred solitude surrounded by water having but twenty four hours after receiving order prepare for my departure find boat carriages get out island territory had i had wings i should scarcely have been able pay obedience it this i wrote bailiff nidau answer his letter hastened take my departure from country iniquity this manner was i obliged abandon my favorite project for which reason not having my oppression been able prevail upon my persecutors dispose me otherwise i determined consequence invitation my lord marshal upon journey berlin leaving theresa pass winter island st peter with my books effects depositing my papers hands m du peyrou i used so much diligence that next morning i left island arrived at bienne before noon accident which i cannot pass over silence had here well nigh put end my journey as soon as news or my having received order quit my asylum was circulated i received great number visits from neighborhood especially from bernois who came with most detestable falsehood flatter soothe me protesting that my persecutors had seized moment vacation senate obtain send me order which said they had excited indignation two hundred some these comforters came from city bienne little free state within that berne amongst others young man name wildremet whose family was first rank had greatest credit that city wildremet strongly solicited me name his fellow citizens choose my retreat amongst them assuring me that they were anxiously desirous it that they would think it honor their duty make me forget persecutions i had suffered that with them i had nothing fear from influence bernois that bienne was free city governed by its own laws that citizens were unanimously resolved not hearken any solicitation which should be unfavorable me wildremet perceiving all he could say be ineffectual brought his aid several other persons as well from bienne environs as from berne even amongst others same kirkeberguer whom i have spoken who after my retreat switzerland had endeavored obtain my esteem by his talents principles had interested me his favor but i received much less expected more weighty solicitations from m barthes secretary embassy from france who came with wildremet see me exhorted me accept his invitation surprised me by lively tender concern he seemed feel for my situation i did not know m barthes however i perceived what he said warmth zeal friendship that he had it at heart persuade me fix my residence at bienne he made most pompous eulogium city its inhabitants with whom he showed himself so intimately connected as call them several times my presence his patrons fathers this from barthes bewildered me my conjectures i had always suspected m de choisuel be secret author all persecutions i suffered switzerland conduct resident geneva that ambassador at soleure but too much confirmed my suspicion i perceived secret influence france everything that happened me at berne geneva neuchatel i did not think i had any powerful enemy that kingdom except duke de choiseul what therefore could i think visit barthes tender concern he showed for my welfare my misfortunes had not yet destroyed confidence natural my heart i had still learn from experience discern snares under appearance friendship i sought with surprise reason benevolence m barthes i was not weak enough believe he had acted from himself there was his manner something ostentatious affectation even which declared concealed intention i was far from having found any these little subaltern agents that generous intrepidity which when i was similar employment had often caused fermentation my heart i had formerly known something chevalier beauteville at castle montmorency he had shown me marks esteem since his appointment embassy he had given me proofs his not having entirely forgotten me accompanied with invitation go see him at soleure though i did not accept this invitation i was extremely sensible his civility not having been accustomed be treated with such kindness by people place i presume m de beauteville obliged follow his instructions what related affairs geneva yet pitying me under my misfortunes had by his private cares prepared for me asylum bienne that i might live there peace under his auspices i was properly sensible his attention but without wishing profit by it quite determined upon journey berlin i sighed after moment which i was see my lord marshal persuaded i should future find real repose lasting happiness nowhere but near his person on my departure from island kirkeberguer accompanied me bienne i found wildremet other biennois who by water side waited my getting out boat we all dined together at inn on my arrival there my first care was provide chaise being determined set off next morning whilst we were at dinner these gentlemen repeated their solicitations prevail upon me stay with them this with such warmth obliging protestations that notwithstanding all my resolutions my heart which has never been able resist friendly attentions received impression from theirs moment they perceived i was shaken they redoubled their efforts with so much effect that i was at length overcome consented remain at bienne at least until spring wildremet immediately set about providing me with lodging boasted as fortunate discovery dirty little chamber back house on third story looking into courtyard where i had for view display stinking skins dresser chamois leather my host was man mean appearance good deal rascal next day after i went his house i heard that he was debauchee gamester bad credit neighborhood he had neither wife children nor servants shut up my solitary chamber i was midst one most agreeable countries europe lodged manner make me die melancholy course few days what affected me most was that notwithstanding what i had heard anxious wish inhabitants receive me amongst them i had not perceived as i passed through streets anything polite towards me their manners or obliging their looks i was however determined remain there but i learned saw felt day after that there was city terrible fermentation which i was cause several persons hastened obligingly inform me that on next day i was receive order conceived most severe terms immediately quit state that is city i had nobody whom i could confide they who had detained me were dispersed wildremet had disappeared i heard no more barthes it did not appear that his recommendation had brought me into great favor with those whom he had styled his patrons fathers one m de van travers bernois who had agreeable house not far from city offered it me for my asylum hoping as he said that i might there avoid being stoned advantage this offer held out was not sufficiently flattering tempt me prolong my abode with these hospitable people yet having lost three days by delay i had greatly exceeded twenty four hours bernois had given me quit their states knowing their severity i was not without apprehensions as manner which they would suffer me cross them when bailiff nidau came opportunely relieved me from my embarrassment as he had highly disapproved violent proceedings their excellencies he thought his generosity he owed me some public proof his taking no part them had courage leave his bailiwick come pay me visit at bienne he did me this favor evening before my departure far from being incognito he affected ceremony coming fiocchi his coach with his secretary brought me passport his own name that i might cross state berne at my ease without fear molestation i was more flattered by visit than by passport should have been as sensible merit it had it had for object any other person whatsoever nothing makes greater impression on my heart than well timed act courage favor weak unjustly oppressed at length after having with difficulty procured chaise i next morning left this barbarous country before arrival deputation with which i was be honored even before i had seen theresa whom i had written come me when i thought i should remain at bienne whom i had scarcely time countermand by short letter informing her my new disaster third part my memoirs if ever i be able write them i shall state what manner thinking set off for berlin i really took my departure for england means by which two ladies who wished dispose my person after having by their manoeuvres driven me from switzerland where i was not sufficiently their power at last delivered me into hands their friend i added what follows on

g s dedication my dear charles baxter if you ever read this tale you will likely ask yourself more questions than i should care answer as for instance how appin murder has come fall year 1751 how torran rocks have crept so near earraid or why printed trial is silent as all that touches david balfour these are nuts beyond my ability crack but if you tried me on point alan s guilt or innocence i think i could defend reading text this day you will find tradition appin clear alan s favour if you inquire you may even hear that descendants other man who fired shot are country this day but that other man s name inquire as you please you shall not hear for highlander values secret for itself for congenial exercise keeping it i might go on for long justify one point own another indefensible it

tremulous laughter i was glad get my bundle on my staff s end set out over ford up hill upon farther side till just as i came on green drove road running wide through heather i took my last look kirk essendean trees about manse big rowans kirkyard where my father my mother lay chapter ii i come my journey s end on forenoon second day coming top hill i saw all country fall away before me down sea midst this descent on long ridge city edinburgh smoking like kiln there was flag upon castle ships moving or lying anchored firth both which for as far away as they were i could distinguish clearly both brought my country heart into my mouth presently after i came by house where shepherd lived got rough direction for neighbourhood cramond so from one another worked my way westward capital by colinton till i came out upon glasgow road there my great pleasure wonder i beheld regiment marching fifes every foot time old red faced general on grey horse at one end at other company grenadiers with their pope s hats pride life seemed mount into my brain at sight red coats hearing that merry music little farther on i was told i was cramond parish began substitute my inquiries name house shaws it was word that seemed surprise those whom i sought my way at first i thought plainness my appearance my country habit that all dusty from road consorted ill with greatness place which i was bound but after two or maybe three had given me same look same answer i began take it my head there was something strange about shaws itself better set this fear at rest i changed form my inquiries spying honest fellow coming along lane on shaft his cart i asked him if he had ever heard tell house they called house shaws he stopped his cart looked at me like others ay said he what for it s great house i asked doubtless says he house is big muckle house ay said i but folk that are it folk cried he are ye daft there s nae folk there call folk what say i not mr ebenezer ou ay says man there s laird be sure if it s him you re wanting what ll like be your business mannie i was led think that i would get situation i said looking as modest as i could what cries carter so sharp note that his very horse started then well mannie he added it s nane my affairs but ye seem decent spoken lad if ye ll take word from me ye ll keep clear shaws next person i came across was dapper little man beautiful white wig whom i saw be barber on his rounds knowing well that barbers were great gossips i asked him plainly what sort man was mr balfour shaws hoot hoot hoot said barber nae kind man nae kind man at all began ask me very shrewdly what my business was but i was more than match for him at that he went on his next customer no wiser than he came i cannot well describe blow this dealt my illusions more indistinct accusations were less i liked them for they left wider field fancy what kind great house was this that all parish should start stare be asked way it or what sort gentleman that his ill fame should be thus current on wayside if hour s walking would have brought me back essendean i had left my adventure then there returned mr campbell s but when i had come so far way already mere shame would not suffer me desist till i had put matter touch proof i was bound out mere self respect carry it through little as i liked sound what i heard slow as i began travel i still kept asking my way still kept advancing it was drawing on sundown when i met stout dark sour looking woman coming trudging down hill she when i had put my usual question turned sharp about accompanied me back summit she had just left pointed great bulk building standing very bare upon green bottom next valley country was pleasant round about running low hills pleasantly watered wooded crops my eyes wonderfully good but house itself appeared be kind ruin no road led up it no smoke arose from any chimneys nor was there any semblance garden my heart sank that i cried woman s face lit up with malignant anger that is house shaws she cried blood built it blood stopped building it blood shall bring it down see here she cried again i spit upon ground crack my thumb at it black be its fall if ye see laird tell him what ye hear tell him this makes twelve hunner nineteen time that jennet clouston has called down curse on him his house byre stable man guest master wife miss or bairn black black be their fall woman whose voice had risen kind eldritch sing song turned with skip was gone i stood where she left me with my hair on end those days folk still believed witches trembled at curse this one falling so pat like wayside omen arrest me ere i carried out my purpose took pith out my legs i sat me down stared at house shaws more i looked pleasanter that country side appeared being all set with hawthorn bushes full flowers fields dotted with sheep fine flight rooks sky every sign kind soil climate yet barrack midst it went sore against my fancy country folk went by from fields as i sat there on side ditch but i lacked spirit give them good e en at last sun went down then right up against yellow sky i saw scroll smoke go mounting not much thicker as it seemed me than smoke candle but still there it was meant fire warmth cookery some living inhabitant that must have lit it this comforted my heart so i set forward by little faint track grass that led my direction it was very faint indeed be only way place habitation yet i saw no other presently it brought me stone uprights with unroofed lodge beside them coats arms upon top main entrance it was plainly meant be but never finished instead gates wrought iron pair hurdles were tied across with straw rope as there were no park walls nor any sign avenue track that i was following passed on right hand pillars went wandering on toward house nearer i got that drearier it appeared it seemed like one wing house that had never been finished what should have been inner end stood open on upper floors showed against sky with steps stairs uncompleted masonry many windows were unglazed bats flew out like doves out dove cote night had begun fall as i got close three lower windows which were very high up narrow well barred changing light little fire began glimmer was this palace i had been coming was it within these walls that i was seek new friends begin great fortunes why my father s house on essen waterside fire bright lights would show mile away door open beggar s knock i came forward cautiously giving ear as i came heard some one rattling with dishes little dry eager cough that came fits but there was no sound speech not dog barked door as well as i could see it dim light was great piece wood all studded with nails i lifted my hand with faint heart under my jacket knocked once then i stood waited house had fallen into dead silence whole minute passed away nothing stirred but bats overhead i knocked again hearkened again by this time my ears had grown so accustomed quiet that i could hear ticking clock inside as it slowly counted out seconds but whoever was that house kept deadly still must have held his breath i was two minds whether run away but anger got upper hand i began instead rain kicks buffets on door shout out aloud for mr balfour i was full career when i heard cough right overhead jumping back looking up beheld man s head tall nightcap bell mouth blunderbuss at one first storey windows it s loaded said voice i have come here with letter i said mr ebenezer balfour shaws is he here from whom is it asked man with blunderbuss that is neither here nor there said i for i was growing very wroth well was reply ye can put it down upon doorstep be off with ye i will do no such thing i cried i will deliver it into mr balfour s hands as it was meant i should it is letter introduction what cried voice sharply i repeated what i had said who are ye yourself was next question after considerable pause i am not ashamed my name said i they call me david balfour at that i made sure man started for i heard blunderbuss rattle on window sill it was after quite long pause with curious change voice that next question followed is your father dead i was so much surprised at this that i could find no voice answer but stood staring ay man resumed he ll be dead no doubt that ll be what brings ye chapping my door another pause then defiantly well man he said i ll let ye he disappeared from window chapter iii i make acquaintance my uncle presently there came great rattling chains bolts door was cautiously opened shut again behind me as soon as i had passed go into kitchen touch naething said voice while person house set himself replacing defences door i groped my way forward entered kitchen fire had burned up fairly bright showed me barest room i think i ever put my eyes on half dozen dishes stood upon shelves table was laid for supper with bowl porridge horn spoon cup small beer besides what i have named there was not another thing that great stone vaulted empty chamber but lockfast chests arranged along wall corner cupboard with padlock as soon as last chain was up man rejoined me he was mean stooping narrow shouldered clay faced creature his age might have been anything between fifty seventy his nightcap was flannel so was nightgown that he wore instead coat waistcoat over his ragged shirt he was long unshaved but what most distressed even daunted me he would neither take his eyes away from me nor look me fairly face what he was whether by trade or birth was more than i could fathom but he seemed most like old unprofitable serving man who should have been left charge that big house upon board wages are ye sharp set he asked glancing at about level my knee ye can eat that drop parritch i said i feared it was his own supper o said he i can do fine wanting it i ll take ale though for it slockens 1 my cough he drank cup about half out still keeping eye upon me as he drank then suddenly held out his hand let s see letter said he 1 moistens i told him letter was for mr balfour not for him who do ye think i am says he give me alexander s letter you know my father s name it would be strange if i didnae he returned for he was my born brother little as ye seem like either me or my house or my good parritch i m your born uncle davie my man you my born nephew so give us letter sit down fill your kyte if i had been some years younger what with shame weariness disappointment i believe i had burst into tears as it was i could find no words neither black nor white but handed him letter sat down porridge with as little appetite for meat as ever young man had meanwhile my uncle stooping over fire turned letter over over his hands do ye ken what s it he asked suddenly you see for yourself sir said i that seal has not been broken ay said he but what brought you here give letter said i no says he cunningly but ye ll have had some hopes nae doubt i confess sir said i when i was told that i had kinsfolk well do i did indeed indulge hope that they might help me my life but i am no beggar i look for no favours at your hands i want none that are not freely given for as poor as i appear i have friends my own that will be blithe help me hoot toot said uncle ebenezer dinnae fly up snuff at me we ll agree fine yet davie my man if you re done with that bit parritch i could just take sup it myself ay he continued as soon as he had ousted me from stool spoon they re fine halesome food they re grand food parritch he murmured little grace himself fell your father was very fond his meat i mind he was hearty if not great eater but as for me i could never do mair than pyke at food he took pull at small beer which probably reminded him hospitable duties for his next speech ran thus if ye re dry ye ll find water behind door this i returned no answer standing stiffly on my two feet looking down upon my uncle with mighty angry heart he on his part continued eat like man under some pressure time throw out little darting glances now at my shoes now at my home spun stockings once only when he had ventured look little higher our eyes met no thief taken with hand man s pocket could have shown more lively signals distress this set me muse whether his timidity arose from too long disuse any human company whether perhaps upon little trial it might pass off my uncle change into altogether different man from this i was awakened by his sharp voice your father s been long dead he asked three weeks sir said i he was secret man alexander secret silent man he continued he never said muckle when he was young he ll never have spoken muckle me i never knew sir till you told it me yourself that he had any brother dear me dear me said ebenezer nor yet shaws i dare say not so much as name sir said i think o that said he strange nature man for all that he seemed singularly satisfied but whether with himself or me or with this conduct my father s was more than i could read certainly however he seemed be outgrowing that distaste or ill will that he had conceived at first against my person for presently he jumped up came across room behind me hit me smack upon shoulder we ll agree fine yet he cried i m just as glad i let you now come awa your bed my surprise he lit no lamp or candle but set forth into dark passage groped his way breathing deeply up flight steps paused before door which he unlocked i was close upon his heels having stumbled after him as best i might then he bade me go for that was my chamber i did as he bid but paused after few steps begged light go bed with hoot toot said uncle ebenezer there s fine moon neither moon nor star sir pit mirk 2 said i i cannae see bed 2 dark as pit hoot toot hoot toot said he lights house is thing i dinnae agree with i m unco feared fires good night ye davie my man before i had time add further protest he pulled door i heard him lock me from outside i did not know whether laugh or cry room was as cold as well bed when i had found my way it as damp as peat hag but by good fortune i had caught up my bundle my plaid rolling myself latter i lay down upon floor under lee big bedstead fell speedily asleep with first peep day i opened my eyes find myself great chamber hung with stamped leather furnished with fine embroidered furniture lit by three fair windows ten years ago or perhaps twenty it must have been as pleasant room lie down or awake as man could wish but damp dirt disuse mice spiders had done their worst since then many window panes besides were broken indeed this was so common feature that house that i believe my uncle must at some time have stood siege from his indignant neighbours perhaps with jennet clouston at their head meanwhile sun was shining outside being very cold that miserable room i knocked shouted till my gaoler came let me out he carried me back house where was draw well told me wash my face there if i wanted when that was done i made best my own way back kitchen where he had lit fire was making porridge table was laid with two bowls two horn spoons but same single measure small beer perhaps my eye rested on this particular with some surprise perhaps my uncle observed it for he spoke up as if answer my thought asking me if i would like drink ale for so he called it i told him such was my habit but not put himself about na na said he i ll deny you nothing reason he fetched another cup from shelf then my great surprise instead drawing more beer he poured accurate half from one cup other there was kind nobleness this that took my breath away if my uncle was certainly miser he was one that thorough breed that goes near make vice respectable when we had made end our meal my uncle ebenezer unlocked drawer drew out it clay pipe lump tobacco from which he cut one fill before he locked it up again then he sat down sun at one windows silently smoked from time time his eyes came coasting round me he shot out one his questions once it was your mother when i had told him that she too was dead ay she was bonnie lassie then after another long pause whae were these friends o yours i told him they were different gentlemen name campbell though indeed there was only one that minister that had ever taken least note me but i began think my uncle made too light my position finding myself all alone with him i did not wish him suppose me helpless he seemed turn this over his mind then davie my

my best it shall be through no fault mine chapter iv i run great danger house shaws for day that was begun so ill day passed fairly well we had porridge cold again at noon hot porridge at night porridge small beer was my uncle s diet he spoke but little that same way as before shooting question at me after long silence when i sought lead him talk about my future slipped out it again room next door kitchen where he suffered me go i found great number books both latin english which i took great pleasure all afternoon indeed time passed so lightly this good company that i began be almost reconciled my residence at shaws nothing but sight my uncle his eyes playing hide seek with mine revived force my distrust one thing i discovered which put me some doubt this was entry on fly leaf chap book one patrick walker s plainly written by my father s hand thus conceived my brother ebenezer on his fifth birthday now what puzzled me was this that as my father was course younger brother he must either have made some strange error or he must have written before he was yet five excellent clear manly hand writing i tried get this out my head but though i took down many interesting authors old new history poetry story book this notion my father s hand writing stuck me when at length i went back into kitchen sat down once more porridge small beer first thing i said uncle ebenezer was ask him if my father had not been very quick at his book alexander no him was reply i was far quicker mysel i was clever chappie when i was young why i could read as soon as he could this puzzled me yet more thought coming into my head i asked if he my father had been twins he jumped upon his stool horn spoon fell out his hand upon floor what gars ye ask that he said he caught me by breast jacket looked this time straight into my eyes his own were little light bright like bird s blinking winking strangely what do you mean i asked very calmly for i was far stronger than he not easily frightened take your hand from my jacket this is no way behave my uncle seemed make great effort upon himself dod man david he said ye should nae speak me about your father that s where mistake is he sat awhile shook blinking his plate he was all brother that ever i had he added but with no heart his voice then he caught up his spoon fell supper again but still shaking now this last passage this laying hands upon my person sudden profession love for my dead father went so clean beyond my comprehension that it put me into both fear hope on one hand i began think my uncle was perhaps insane might be dangerous on other there came up into my mind quite unbidden by me even discouraged story like some ballad i had heard folk singing poor lad that was rightful heir wicked kinsman that tried keep him from his own for why should my uncle play part with relative that came almost beggar his door unless his heart he had some cause fear him with this notion all unacknowledged but nevertheless getting firmly settled my head i now began imitate his covert looks so that we sat at table like cat mouse each stealthily observing other not another word had he say me black or white but was busy turning something secretly over his mind longer we sat more i looked at him more certain i became that something was unfriendly myself when he had cleared platter he got out single pipeful tobacco just as morning turned round stool into chimney corner sat awhile smoking with his back me davie he said at length i ve been thinking then he paused said it again there s wee bit siller that i half promised ye before ye were born he continued promised it your father o naething legal ye understand just gentlemen daffing at their wine well i keepit that bit money separate it was great expense but promise is promise it has grown by now be matter just precisely just exactly here he paused stumbled just exactly forty pounds this last he rapped out with sidelong glance over his shoulder next moment added almost with scream scots pound scots being same thing as english shilling difference made by this second thought was considerable i could see besides that whole story was lie invented with some end which it puzzled me guess i made no attempt conceal tone raillery which i answered o think again sir pounds sterling i believe that s what i said returned my uncle pounds sterling if you ll step out by door minute just see what kind night it is i ll get it out ye call ye again i did his will smiling myself my contempt that he should think i was so easily be deceived it was dark night with few stars low down as i stood just outside door i heard hollow moaning wind far off among hills i said myself there was something thundery changeful weather little knew what vast importance that should prove me before evening passed when i was called again my uncle counted out into my hand seven thirty golden guinea pieces rest was his hand small gold silver but his heart failed him there he crammed change into his pocket there said he that ll show you i m queer man strange wi strangers but my word is my bond there s proof it now my uncle seemed so miserly that i was struck dumb by this sudden generosity could find no words which thank him no word said he nae thanks i want nae thanks i do my duty i m no saying that everybody would have done it but for my part though i m careful body too it s pleasure me do right by my brother s son it s pleasure me think that now we ll agree as such near friends should i spoke him return as handsomely as i was able but all while i was wondering what would come next why he had parted with his precious guineas for as reason he had given baby would have refused it presently he looked towards me sideways see here says he tit for tat i told him i was ready prove my gratitude any reasonable degree then waited looking for some monstrous demand yet when at last he plucked up courage speak it was only tell me very properly as i thought that he was growing old little broken that he would expect me help him with house bit garden i answered expressed my readiness serve well he said let s begin he pulled out his pocket rusty key there says he there s key stair tower at far end house ye can only win into it from outside for that part house is no finished gang ye there up stairs bring me down chest that s at top there s papers t he added can i have light sir said i na said he very cunningly nae lights my house very well sir said i are stairs good they re grand said he then as i was going keep wall he added there s nae bannisters but stairs are grand underfoot out i went into night wind was still moaning distance though never breath it came near house shaws it had fallen blacker than ever i was glad feel along wall till i came length stairtower door at far end unfinished wing i had got key into keyhole had just turned it when all upon sudden without sound wind or thunder whole sky lighted up with wild fire went black again i had put my hand over my eyes get back colour darkness indeed i was already half blinded when i stepped into tower it was so dark inside it seemed body could scarce breathe but i pushed out with foot hand presently struck wall with one lowermost round stair with other wall by touch was fine hewn stone steps too though somewhat steep narrow were polished masonwork regular solid underfoot minding my uncle s word about bannisters i kept close tower side felt my way pitch darkness with beating heart house shaws stood some five full storeys high not counting lofts well as i advanced it seemed me stair grew airier thought more lightsome i was wondering what might be cause this change when second blink summer lightning came went if i did not cry out it was because fear had me by throat if i did not fall it was more by heaven s mercy than my own strength it was not only that flash shone on every side through breaches wall so that i seemed be clambering aloft upon open scaffold but same passing brightness showed me steps were unequal length that one my feet rested that moment within two inches well this was grand stair i thought with thought gust kind angry courage came into my heart my uncle had sent me here certainly run great risks perhaps die i swore i would settle that perhaps if i should break my neck for it got me down upon my hands knees as slowly as snail feeling before me every inch testing solidity every stone i continued ascend stair darkness by contrast with flash appeared have redoubled nor was that all for my ears were now troubled my mind confounded by great stir bats top part tower foul beasts flying downwards sometimes beat about my face body tower i should have said was square every corner step was made great stone different shape join flights well i had come close one these turns when feeling forward as usual my hand slipped upon edge found nothing but emptiness beyond it stair had been carried no higher set stranger mounting it darkness was send him straight his death although thanks lightning my own precautions i was safe enough mere thought peril which i might have stood dreadful height i might have fallen from brought out sweat upon my body relaxed my joints but i knew what i wanted now turned groped my way down again with wonderful anger my heart about half way down wind sprang up clap shook tower died again rain followed before i had reached ground level it fell buckets i put out my head into storm looked along towards kitchen door which i had shut behind me when i left now stood open shed little glimmer light i thought i could see figure standing rain quite still like man hearkening then there came blinding flash which showed me my uncle plainly just where i had fancied him stand hard upon heels it great tow row thunder now whether my uncle thought crash be sound my fall or whether he heard it god s voice denouncing murder i will leave you guess certain it is at least that he was seized on by kind panic fear that he ran into house left door open behind him i followed as softly as i could coming unheard into kitchen stood watched him he had found time open corner cupboard bring out great case bottle aqua vitae now sat with his back towards me at table ever again he would be seized with fit deadly shuddering groan aloud carrying bottle his lips drink down raw spirits by mouthful i stepped forward came close behind him where he sat suddenly clapping my two hands down upon his shoulders ah cried i my uncle gave kind broken cry like sheep s bleat flung up his arms tumbled floor like dead man i was somewhat shocked at this but i had myself look first all did not hesitate let him lie as he had fallen keys were hanging cupboard it was my design furnish myself with arms before my uncle should come again his senses power devising evil cupboard were few bottles some apparently medicine great many bills other papers which i should willingly enough have rummaged had i had time few necessaries that were nothing my purpose thence i turned chests first was full meal second moneybags papers tied into sheaves third with many other things these for most part clothes i found rusty ugly looking highland dirk without scabbard this then i concealed inside my waistcoat turned my uncle he lay as he had fallen all huddled with one knee up one arm sprawling abroad his face had strange colour blue he seemed have ceased breathing fear came on me that he was dead then i got water dashed it his face with that he seemed come little himself working his mouth fluttering his eyelids at last he looked up saw me there came into his eyes terror that was not this world come come said i sit up are ye alive he sobbed o man are ye alive that am i said i small thanks you he had begun seek for his breath with deep sighs blue phial said he aumry blue phial his breath came slower still i ran cupboard sure enough found there blue phial medicine with dose written on it on paper this i administered him with what speed i might it s trouble said he reviving little i have trouble davie it s heart i set him on chair looked at him it is true i felt some pity for man that looked so sick but i was full besides righteous anger i numbered over before him points on which i wanted explanation why he lied me at every word why he feared that i should leave him why he disliked it be hinted that he my father were twins is that because it is true i asked why he had given me money which i was convinced i had no claim last all why he had tried kill me he heard me all through silence then broken voice begged me let him go bed i ll tell ye morn he said as sure as death i will so weak was he that i could do nothing but consent i locked him into his room however pocketed key then returning kitchen made up such blaze as had not shone there for many long year wrapping myself my plaid lay down upon chests fell asleep chapter v i go queen s ferry much rain fell night next morning there blew bitter wintry wind out north west driving scattered clouds for all that before sun began peep or last stars had vanished i made my way side burn had plunge deep whirling pool all aglow from my bath i sat down once more beside fire which i replenished began gravely consider my position there was now no doubt about my uncle s enmity there was no doubt i carried my life my hand he would leave no stone unturned that he might compass my destruction but i was young spirited like most lads that have been country bred i had great opinion my shrewdness i had come his door no better than beggar little more than child he had met me with treachery violence it would be fine consummation take upper hand drive him like herd sheep i sat there nursing my knee smiling at fire i saw myself fancy smell out his secrets one after another grow be that man s king ruler warlock essendean they say had made mirror which men could read future it must have been other stuff than burning coal for all shapes pictures that i sat gazed at there was never ship never seaman with hairy cap never big bludgeon for my silly head or least sign all those tribulations that were ripe fall on me presently all swollen with conceit i went up stairs gave my prisoner his liberty he gave me good morning civilly i gave same him smiling down upon him from heights my sufficiency soon we were set breakfast as it might have been day before well sir said i with jeering tone have you nothing more say me then as he made no articulate reply it will be time i think understand each other i continued you took me for country johnnie raw with no more mother wit or courage than porridge stick i took you for good man or no worse than others at least it seems we were both wrong what cause you have fear me cheat me attempt my life he murmured something about jest that he liked bit fun then seeing me smile changed his tone assured me he would make all clear as soon as we had breakfasted i saw by his face that he had no lie ready for me though he was hard at work preparing one i think i was about tell him so when we were interrupted by knocking at door bidding my uncle sit where he was i went open it found on doorstep half grown boy sea clothes he had no sooner seen me than he began dance some steps sea hornpipe which i had never before heard far less seen snapping his fingers air footing it right cleverly for all that he was blue with cold there was something his face look between tears laughter that was highly pathetic consisted ill with this gaiety manner what cheer mate says he with cracked voice i asked him soberly name his pleasure o pleasure says he then began sing for it s my delight shiny night season year well said i if you have no business at all i will even be so unmannerly as shut you out stay brother he cried have you no fun about you or do you want get me thrashed i ve brought letter from old heasyoasy mr belflower he showed me letter as he spoke i say mate he added i m mortal hungry well said i come into house you shall have bite if i go empty for it with that i brought him set him down my own place where he fell greedily on remains breakfast winking me between whiles making many faces which i think poor soul considered manly meanwhile my uncle had read letter sat thinking then suddenly he got his feet with great air liveliness pulled me apart into farthest corner room read that said he put letter my hand here it is lying before me as i write hawes inn at queen s ferry sir i lie here with my hawser up down send my cabin boy informe if you have any further commands for over seas day will be last occasion as wind will serve us well out firth i will not seek deny that i have had crosses with your doer 4 mr rankeillor which if not speedily redd up you may looke see some losses follow i have drawn bill upon you as per margin am sir your most obedt humble servant elias hoseason 4 agent you see davie resumed my uncle as soon as he saw that i had done i have venture with this man hoseason captain trading brig covenant dysart now if you me was walk over with yon lad i could see captain at hawes or maybe on board covenant if there was papers be signed so far from loss time we can jog on lawyer mr rankeillor s after that s come gone ye would be swier 5 believe me upon my naked word but ye ll believe rankeillor he s factor half gentry these parts auld man forby highly respeckit he kenned your father 5 unwilling i stood awhile thought i was going some place shipping which was doubtless populous where my uncle durst attempt no violence indeed even society cabin boy so far protected me once there i believed i could force on visit lawyer even if my uncle were now insincere proposing it perhaps bottom my heart i wished nearer view sea ships you are remember i had lived all my life inland hills just two days before had my first sight firth lying like blue floor sailed ships moving on face it no bigger than toys one thing with another i made up my mind very well says i let us go ferry my uncle got into his hat coat buckled old rusty cutlass on then we trod fire out locked door set forth upon our walk wind being that cold quarter north west blew nearly our faces as we went it was month june grass was all white with daisies trees with blossom but judge by our blue nails aching wrists time might have been winter whiteness december frost uncle ebenezer trudged ditch jogging from side side like old ploughman coming home from work he never said word whole way i was thrown for talk on cabin boy he told me his name was ransome that he had followed sea since he was nine but could not say how old he was as he had lost his reckoning he showed me tattoo marks baring his breast teeth wind spite my remonstrances for i thought it was enough kill him he swore horribly whenever he remembered but more like silly schoolboy than man boasted many wild bad things that he had done stealthy thefts false accusations ay even murder but all with such dearth likelihood details such weak crazy swagger delivery as disposed me rather pity than believe him i asked him brig which he declared was finest ship that sailed captain hoseason whose praises he was equally loud heasyoasy for so he still named skipper was man by his account that minded for nothing either heaven or earth one that as people said would crack on all sail into day judgment rough fierce unscrupulous brutal all this my poor cabin boy had taught himself admire as something seamanlike manly he would only admit one flaw his idol he ain t no seaman he admitted that s mr shuan that navigates brig he s finest seaman trade only for drink i tell you i believe it why look ere turning down his stocking he showed me great raw red wound that made my blood run cold he done that mr shuan done it he said with air pride what i cried do you take such savage usage at his hands why you are no slave be so handled no said poor moon calf changing his tune at once so he ll find see ere he showed me great case knife which he told me was stolen o says he let me see him try i dare him i ll do for him o he ain t first he confirmed it with poor silly ugly oath i have never felt such pity for any one this wide world as i felt for that half witted creature it began come over me that brig covenant for all her pious name was little better than hell upon seas have you no friends said i he said he had father some english seaport i forget which he was fine man too he said but he s dead heaven s name cried i can you find no reputable life on shore o no says he winking looking very sly they would put me trade i know trick worth two that i do i asked him what trade could be so dreadful as one he followed where he ran continual peril his life not alone from wind sea but by horrid cruelty those who were his masters he said it was very true then began praise life tell what pleasure it was get on shore with money his pocket spend it like man buy apples swagger surprise what he called stick mud boys then it s not all as bad as that says he there s worse off than me there s twenty pounders o laws you should see them taking on why i ve seen man as old as you i dessay him i seemed old ah he had beard too well as soon as we cleared out river he had drug out his head my how he cried carried on i made fine fool him i tell you then there s little uns too oh little by me i tell you i keep them order when we carry little uns i have rope s end my own wollop em so he ran on until it came on me what he meant by twenty pounders were those unhappy criminals who were sent over seas slavery north america or still more unhappy innocents who were kidnapped or trepanned as word went for private interest or vengeance just then we came top hill looked down on ferry hope firth forth as is very well known narrows at this point width good sized river which makes convenient ferry going north turns upper reach into landlocked haven for all manner ships right midst narrows lies islet with some ruins on south shore they have built pier for service ferry at end pier on other side road backed against pretty garden holly trees hawthorns i could see building which they called hawes inn town queensferry lies farther west neighbourhood inn looked pretty lonely at that time day for boat had just gone north with passengers skiff however lay beside pier with some seamen sleeping on thwarts this as ransome told me was brig s boat waiting for captain about half mile off all alone anchorage he showed me covenant herself there was sea going bustle on board yards were swinging into place as wind blew from that quarter i could hear song sailors as they pulled upon ropes after all i had listened upon way i looked at that ship with extreme abhorrence from bottom my heart i pitied all poor souls that were condemned sail her we had all three pulled up on brow hill now i marched across road addressed my uncle i think it right tell you sir says i there s nothing that will bring me on board that covenant he seemed waken from dream eh he said what s that i told him over again well well he said we ll have please ye i suppose but what are we standing here for it s perishing cold if i m no mistaken they re busking covenant for sea chapter vi what befell at queen s ferry as soon as we came inn ransome led us up stair small room with bed it heated like oven by great fire coal at table hard by chimney tall dark sober looking man sat writing spite heat room he wore thick sea jacket buttoned neck tall hairy cap drawn down over his ears yet i never saw any man not even judge upon bench look cooler or more studious self possessed than this ship captain he got his feet at once coming forward offered his large hand ebenezer i am proud see you mr balfour said he fine deep voice glad that ye are here time wind s fair tide upon turn we ll see old coal bucket burning on isle may before night captain hoseason returned my uncle you keep your room unco hot it s habit i have mr balfour said skipper i m cold rife man by my nature i have cold blood sir there s neither fur nor flannel no sir nor hot rum will warm up what they call temperature sir it s same with most men that have been carbonadoed as they call it tropic seas well well captain replied my uncle we must all be way we re made but it chanced that this fancy captain s had great share my misfortunes for though i had promised myself not let my kinsman out sight i was both so impatient for nearer look sea so sickened by closeness room that when he told me run down stairs play myself awhile i was fool enough take him at his word away i went therefore leaving two men sitting down bottle great mass papers crossing road front inn walked down upon beach with wind that quarter only little wavelets not much bigger than i had seen upon lake beat upon shore but weeds were new me some green some brown long some with little bladders that crackled between my fingers even so far up firth smell sea water was exceedingly salt stirring covenant besides was beginning shake out her sails which hung upon yards clusters spirit all that i beheld put me thoughts far voyages foreign places i looked too at seamen with skiff big brown fellows some shirts some with jackets some with coloured handkerchiefs about their throats one with brace pistols stuck into his pockets two or three with knotty bludgeons all with their case knives i passed time day with one that looked less desperate than his fellows asked him sailing brig he said they would get under way as soon as ebb set expressed his gladness be out port where there were no taverns fiddlers but all with such horrifying oaths that i made haste get away from him this threw me back on ransome who seemed least wicked that gang who soon came out inn ran me crying for bowl punch i told him i would give him no such thing for neither he nor i was age for such indulgences but glass ale you may have welcome said i he mopped mowed at me called me names but he was glad get ale for all that presently we were set down at table front room inn both eating drinking with good appetite here it occurred me that as landlord was man that county i might do well make friend him i offered him share as was much custom those days but he was far too great man sit with such poor customers as ransome myself he was leaving room when i called him back ask if he knew mr rankeillor hoot ay says he very honest man o by by says he was it you that came with ebenezer when i had told him yes ye ll be no friend his he asked meaning scottish way that i would be no relative i told him no none i thought not said he yet ye have kind gliff 6 mr alexander 6 look i said it seemed that ebenezer was ill seen country nae doubt said landlord he s wicked auld man there s many would like see him girning tow 7 jennet clouston mony mair that he has harried out house hame yet he was ance fine young fellow too but that was before sough 8 gaed abroad about mr alexander that was like death him 7 rope 8 report what was it i asked ou just that he had killed him said landlord did ye never hear that what would he kill him for said i what for but just get place said he place said i shaws nae other place that i ken said he ay man said i is that so was my was alexander eldest son deed was he said landlord what else would he have killed him for with that he went away as he had been impatient do from beginning course i had guessed it long while ago but it is one thing guess another know i sat stunned with my good fortune could scarce grow believe that same poor lad who had trudged dust from ettrick forest not two days ago was now one rich earth had house broad lands might mount his horse tomorrow all these pleasant things thousand others crowded into my mind as i sat staring before me out inn window paying no heed what i saw only i remember that my eye lighted on captain hoseason down on pier among his seamen speaking with some authority presently he came marching back towards house with no mark sailor s clumsiness but carrying his fine tall figure with manly bearing still with same sober grave expression on his face i wondered if it was possible that ransome s stories could be true half disbelieved them they fitted so ill with man s looks but indeed he was neither so good as i supposed him nor quite so bad as ransome did for fact he was two men left better one behind as soon as he set foot on board his vessel next thing i heard my uncle calling me found pair road together it was captain who addressed me that with air very flattering young lad grave equality sir said he mr balfour tells me great things you for my own part i like your looks i wish i was for longer here that we might make better friends but we ll make most what we have ye shall come on board my brig for half hour till ebb sets drink bowl with me now i longed see inside ship more than words can tell but i was not going put myself jeopardy i told him my uncle i had appointment with lawyer ay ay said he he passed me word that but ye see boat ll set ye ashore at town pier that s but penny stonecast from rankeillor s house here he suddenly leaned down whispered my ear take care old tod 9 he means mischief come aboard till i can get word with ye then passing his arm through mine he continued aloud as he set off towards his boat but come what can i bring ye from carolinas any friend mr balfour s can command roll tobacco indian feather work skin wild beast stone pipe mocking bird that mews for all world like cat cardinal bird that is as red as blood take your pick say your pleasure 9 fox by this time we were at boat side he was handing me i did not dream hanging back i thought poor fool that i had found good friend helper i was rejoiced see ship as soon as we were all set our places boat was thrust off from pier began move over waters what with my pleasure this new movement my surprise at our low position appearance shores growing bigness brig as we drew near it i could hardly understand what captain said must have answered him at random as soon as we were alongside where i sat fairly gaping at ship s height strong humming tide against its sides pleasant cries seamen at their work hoseason declaring that he i must be first aboard ordered tackle be sent down from main yard this i was whipped into air set down again on deck where captain stood ready waiting for me instantly slipped back his arm under mine there i stood some while little dizzy with unsteadiness all around me perhaps little afraid yet vastly pleased with these strange sights captain meanwhile pointing out strangest telling me their names uses but where is my uncle said i suddenly ay said hoseason with sudden grimness that s point i felt i was lost with all my strength i plucked myself clear him ran bulwarks sure enough there was boat pulling for town with my uncle sitting stern i gave piercing cry help help murder so that both sides anchorage rang with it my uncle turned round where he was sitting showed me face full cruelty terror it was last i saw already strong hands had been plucking me back from ship s side now thunderbolt seemed strike me i saw great flash fire fell senseless chapter vii i go sea brig covenant dysart i came myself darkness great pain bound hand foot deafened by many unfamiliar noises there sounded my ears roaring water as huge mill dam thrashing heavy sprays thundering sails shrill cries seamen whole world now heaved giddily up now rushed giddily downward so sick hurt was i body my mind so much confounded that it took me long while chasing my thoughts up down ever stunned again by fresh stab pain realise that i must be lying somewhere bound belly that unlucky ship that wind must have strengthened gale with clear perception my plight there fell upon me blackness despair horror remorse at my own folly passion anger at my uncle that once more bereft me my senses when i returned again life same uproar same confused violent movements shook deafened me presently my other pains distresses there was added sickness unused landsman on sea that time my adventurous youth i suffered many hardships but none that was so crushing my mind body or lit by so few hopes as these first hours aboard brig i heard gun fire supposed storm had proved too strong for us we were firing signals distress thought deliverance even by death deep sea was welcome me yet it was no such matter but as i was afterwards told common habit captain s which i here set down show that even worst man may have his kindlier side we were then passing it appeared within some miles dysart where brig was built where old mrs hoseason captain s mother had come some years before live whether outward or inward bound covenant was never suffered go by that place by day without gun fired colours shown i had no measure time day night were alike that ill smelling cavern ship s bowels where i lay misery my situation drew out hours double how long therefore i lay waiting hear ship split upon some rock or feel her reel head foremost into depths sea i have not means computation but sleep at length stole from me consciousness sorrow i was awakened by light hand lantern shining my face small man about thirty with green eyes tangle fair hair stood looking down at me well said he how goes it i answered by sob my visitor then felt my pulse temples set himself wash dress wound upon my scalp ay said he sore dunt 10 what man cheer up world s no done you ve made bad start it but you ll make better have you had any meat 10 stroke i said i could not look at it thereupon he gave me some brandy water tin pannikin left me once more myself next time he came see me i was lying betwixt sleep waking my eyes wide open darkness sickness quite departed but succeeded by horrid giddiness swimming that was almost worse bear i ached besides every limb cords that bound me seemed be fire smell hole which i lay seemed have become part me during long interval since his last visit i had suffered tortures fear now from scurrying ship s rats that sometimes pattered on my very face now from dismal imaginings that haunt bed fever glimmer lantern as trap opened shone like heaven s sunlight though it only showed me strong dark beams ship that was my prison i could have cried aloud for gladness man with green eyes was first descend ladder i noticed that he came somewhat unsteadily he was followed by captain neither said word but first set examined me dressed my wound as before while hoseason looked me my face with odd black look now sir you see for yourself said first high fever no appetite no light no meat you see for yourself what that means i am no conjurer mr riach said captain give me leave sir said riach you ve good head upon your shoulders good scotch tongue ask with but i will leave you no manner excuse i want that boy taken out this hole put forecastle what ye may want sir is matter concern nobody but yoursel returned captain but i can tell ye that which is be here he is here he shall bide admitting that you have been paid proportion said other i will crave leave humbly say that i have not paid i am none too much be second officer this old tub you ken very well if i do my best earn it but i was paid for nothing more if ye could hold back your hand from tin pan mr riach i would have no complaint make ye returned skipper instead asking riddles i make bold say that ye would keep your breath cool your porridge we ll be required on deck he added sharper note set one foot upon ladder but mr riach caught him by sleeve admitting that you have been paid do murder he began hoseason turned upon him with flash what s that he cried what kind talk is that it seems it is talk that you can understand said mr riach looking him steadily face mr riach i have sailed with ye three cruises replied captain all that time sir ye should have learned know me i m stiff man dour man but for what ye say now fie fie it comes from bad heart black conscience if ye say lad will die ay will he said mr riach well sir is not that enough said hoseason flit him where ye please thereupon captain ascended ladder i who had lain silent throughout this strange conversation beheld mr riach turn after him bow as low as his knees what was plainly spirit derision even my then state sickness i perceived two things that mate was touched with liquor as captain hinted that drunk or sober he was like prove valuable friend five minutes afterwards my bonds were cut i was hoisted on man s back carried up forecastle laid bunk on some sea blankets where first thing that i did was lose my senses it was blessed thing indeed open my eyes again upon daylight find myself society men forecastle was roomy place enough set all about with berths which men watch below were seated smoking or lying down asleep day being calm wind fair scuttle was open not only good daylight but from time time as ship rolled dusty beam sunlight shone dazzled delighted me i had no sooner moved moreover than one men brought me drink something healing which mr riach had prepared bade me lie still i should soon be well again there were no bones broken he explained clour 11 on head was naething man said he it was me that gave it ye 11 blow here i lay for space many days close prisoner not only got my health again but came know my companions they were rough lot indeed as sailors mostly are being men rooted out all kindly parts life condemned toss together on rough seas with masters no less cruel there were some among them that had sailed with pirates seen things it would be shame even speak some were men that had run from king s ships went with halter round their necks which they made no secret all as saying goes were at word blow with their best friends yet i had not been many days shut up with them before i began be ashamed my first judgment when i had drawn away from them at ferry pier as though they had been unclean beasts no class man is altogether bad but each has its own faults virtues these shipmates mine were no exception rule rough they were sure enough bad i suppose but they had many virtues they were kind when it occurred them simple even beyond simplicity country lad like me had some glimmerings honesty there was one man maybe forty that would sit on my berthside for hours tell me his wife child he was fisher that had lost his boat thus been driven deep sea voyaging well it is years ago now but i have never forgotten him his wife who was young by him as he often told me waited vain see her man return he would never again make fire for her morning nor yet keep bairn when she was sick indeed many these poor fellows as event proved were upon their last cruise deep seas cannibal fish received them it is thankless business speak ill dead among other good deeds that they did they returned my money which had been shared among them though it was about third short i was very glad get it hoped great good from it land i was going ship was bound for carolinas you must not suppose that i was going that place merely as exile trade was even then much depressed since that with rebellion colonies formation united states it has course come end but those days my youth white men were still sold into slavery on plantations that was destiny which my wicked uncle had condemned me cabin boy ransome from whom i had first heard these atrocities came at times from round house where he berthed served now nursing bruised limb silent agony now raving against cruelty mr shuan it made my heart bleed but men had great respect for chief mate who was as they said only seaman whole jing bang none such bad man when he was sober indeed i found there was strange peculiarity about our two mates that mr riach was sullen unkind harsh when he was sober mr shuan would not hurt fly except when he was drinking i asked about captain but i was told drink made no difference upon that man iron i did my best small time allowed me make some thing like man or rather i should say something like boy poor creature ransome but his mind was scarce truly human he could remember nothing time before he came sea only that his father had made clocks had starling parlour which could whistle north countrie all else had been blotted out these years hardship cruelties he had strange notion dry land picked up from sailor s stories that it was place where lads were put some kind slavery called trade where apprentices were continually lashed clapped into foul prisons town he thought every second person decoy every third house place which seamen would be drugged murdered be sure i would tell him how kindly i had myself been used upon that dry land he was so much afraid how well fed carefully taught both by my friends my parents if he had been recently hurt he would weep bitterly swear run away but if he was his usual crackbrain humour or still more if he had had glass spirits roundhouse he would deride notion it was mr riach heaven forgive him who gave boy drink it was doubtless kindly meant but besides that it was ruin his health it was pitifullest thing life see this unhappy unfriended creature staggering dancing talking he knew not what some men laughed but not all others would grow as black as thunder thinking perhaps their own childhood or their own children bid him stop that nonsense think what he was doing as for me i felt ashamed look at him poor child still comes about me my dreams all this time you should know covenant was meeting continual head winds tumbling up down against head seas so that scuttle was almost constantly shut forecastle lighted only by swinging lantern on beam there was constant labour for all hands sails had be made shortened every hour strain told on men s temper there was growl quarrelling all day long from berth berth as i was never allowed set my foot on deck you can picture yourselves how weary my life i grew be how impatient for change change i was get as you shall hear but i must first tell conversation i had with mr riach which put little heart me bear my troubles getting him favourable stage drink for indeed he never looked near me when he was sober i pledged him secrecy told him my whole story he declared it was like ballad that he would do his best help me that i should have paper pen ink write one line mr campbell another mr rankeillor that if i had told truth ten one he would be able with their help pull me through set me my rights meantime says he keep your heart up you re not only one i ll tell you that there s many man hoeing tobacco over seas that should be mounting his horse at his own door at home many many life is all variorum at best look at me i m laird s son more than half doctor here i am man jack hoseason i thought it would be civil ask him for his story he whistled loud never had one said he i like fun that s all he skipped out forecastle chapter viii round house one night about eleven o clock man mr riach s watch which was on deck came below for his jacket instantly there began go whisper about forecastle that shuan had done for him at last there was no need name we all knew who was meant but we had scarce time get idea rightly our heads far less speak it when scuttle was again flung open captain hoseason came down ladder he looked sharply round bunks tossing light lantern then walking straight up me he addressed me my surprise tones kindness my man said he we want ye serve round house you ransome are change berths run away aft with ye even as he spoke two seamen appeared scuttle carrying ransome their arms ship at that moment giving great sheer into sea lantern swinging light fell direct on boy s face it was as white as wax had look upon it like dreadful smile blood me ran cold i drew my breath as if i had been struck run away aft run away aft with ye cried hoseason at that i brushed by sailors boy who neither spoke nor moved ran up ladder on deck brig was sheering swiftly giddily through long cresting swell she was on starboard tack on left hand under arched foot foresail i could see sunset still quite bright this at such hour night surprised me greatly but i was too ignorant draw true conclusion that we were going north about round scotland were now on high sea between orkney shetland islands having avoided dangerous currents pentland firth for my part who had been so long shut dark knew nothing head winds i thought we might be half way or more across atlantic indeed beyond that i wondered little at lateness sunset light i gave no heed it pushed on across decks running between seas catching at ropes only saved from going overboard by one hands on deck who had been always kind me round house for which i was bound where i was now sleep serve stood some six feet above decks considering size brig was good dimensions inside were fixed table bench two berths one for captain other for two mates turn turn about it was all fitted with lockers from top bottom so as stow away officers belongings part ship s stores there was second store room underneath which you entered by hatchway middle deck indeed all best meat drink whole powder were collected this place all firearms except two pieces brass ordnance were set rack aftermost wall round house most cutlasses were another place small window with shutter on each side skylight roof gave it light by day after dark there was lamp always burning it was burning when i entered not brightly but enough show mr shuan sitting at table with brandy bottle tin pannikin front him he was tall man strongly made very black he stared before him on table like one stupid he took no notice my coming nor did he move when captain followed leant on berth beside me looking darkly at mate i stood great fear hoseason had my reasons for it but something told me i need not be afraid him just then i whispered his ear how is he he shook his head like one that does not know does not wish think his face was very stern presently mr riach came he gave captain glance that meant boy was dead as plain as speaking took his place like rest us so that we all three stood without word staring down at mr shuan mr shuan on his side sat without word looking hard upon table all sudden he put out his hand take bottle at that mr riach started forward caught it away from him rather by surprise than violence crying out with oath that there had been too much this work altogether that judgment would fall upon ship as he spoke weather sliding doors standing open he tossed bottle into sea mr shuan was on his feet trice he still looked dazed but he meant murder ay would have done it for second time that night had not captain stepped between him his victim sit down roars captain ye sot swine do ye know what ye ve done ye ve murdered boy mr shuan seemed understand for he sat down again put up his hand his brow well he said he brought me dirty pannikin at that word captain i mr riach all looked at each other for second with kind frightened look then hoseason walked up his chief officer took him by shoulder led him across his bunk bade him lie down go sleep as you might speak bad child murderer cried little but he took off his sea boots obeyed ah cried mr riach with dreadful voice ye should have interfered long syne it s too late now mr riach said captain this night s work must never be kennt dysart boy went overboard sir that s what story is i would give five pounds out my pocket it was true he turned table what made ye throw good bottle away he added there was nae sense that sir here david draw me another they re bottom locker he tossed me key ye ll need glass yourself sir he added riach yon was ugly thing see so pair sat down hob nobbed while they did so murderer who had been lying whimpering his berth raised himself upon his elbow looked at them at me that was first night my new duties course next day i had got well into run them i had serve at meals which captain took at regular hours sitting down with officer who was off duty all day through i would be running with dram one or other my three masters at night i slept on blanket thrown on deck boards at aftermost end round house right draught two doors it was hard cold bed nor was i suffered sleep without interruption for some one would be always coming from deck get dram when fresh watch was be set two sometimes all three would sit down brew bowl together how they kept their health i know not any more than how i kept my own yet other ways it was easy service there was no cloth lay meals were either oatmeal porridge or salt junk except twice week when there was duff though i was clumsy enough not being firm on my sealegs sometimes fell with what i was bringing them both mr riach captain were singularly patient i could not but fancy they were making up lee way with their consciences that they would scarce have been so good with me if they had not been worse with ransome as for mr shuan drink or his crime or two together had certainly troubled his mind i cannot say i ever saw him his proper wits he never grew used my being there stared at me continually sometimes i could have thought with terror more than once drew back from my hand when i was serving him i was pretty sure from first that he had no clear mind what he had done on my second day round house i had proof it we were alone he had been staring at me long time when all at once up he got as pale as death came close up me my great terror but i had no cause be afraid him you were not here before he asked no sir said i there was another boy he asked again when i had answered him ah says he i thought that went sat down without another word except call for brandy you may think it strange but for all horror i had i was still sorry for him he was married man with wife leith but whether or no he had family i have now forgotten i hope not altogether it was no very hard life for time it lasted which as you are hear was not long i was as well fed as best them even their pickles which were great dainty i was allowed my share had i liked i might have been drunk from morning night like mr shuan i had company too good company its sort mr riach who had been college spoke me like friend when he was not sulking told me many curious things some that were informing even captain though he kept me at stick s end most part time would sometimes unbuckle bit tell me fine countries he had visited shadow poor ransome be sure lay on all four us on me mr shuan particular most heavily then i had another trouble my own here i was doing dirty work for three men that i looked down upon one whom at least should have hung upon gallows that was for present as for future i could only see myself slaving alongside negroes tobacco fields mr riach perhaps from caution would never suffer me say another word about my story captain whom i tried approach rebuffed me like dog would not hear word as days came went my heart sank lower lower till i was even glad work which kept me from thinking chapter ix man with belt gold more than week went by which ill luck that had hitherto pursued covenant upon this voyage grew yet more strongly marked some days she made little way others she was driven actually back at last we were beaten so far south that we tossed tacked fro whole ninth day within sight cape wrath wild rocky coast on either hand it there followed on that council officers some decision which i did not rightly understand seeing only result that we had made fair wind foul one were running south tenth afternoon there was falling swell thick wet white fog that hid one end brig from other all afternoon when i went on deck i saw men officers listening hard over bulwarks for breakers they said though i did not so much as understand word i felt danger air was excited maybe about ten at night i was serving mr riach captain at their supper when ship struck something with great sound we heard voices singing out my two masters leaped their feet she s struck said mr riach no sir said captain we ve only run boat down they hurried out captain was right it we had run down boat fog she had parted midst gone bottom with all her crew but one this man as i heard afterwards had been sitting stern as passenger while rest were on benches rowing at moment blow stern had been thrown into air man having his hands free for all he was encumbered with frieze overcoat that came below his knees had leaped up caught hold brig s bowsprit it showed he had luck much agility unusual strength that he should have thus saved himself from such pass yet when captain brought him into round house i set eyes on him for first time he looked as cool as i did he was smallish stature but well set as nimble as goat his face was good open expression but sunburnt very dark heavily freckled pitted with small pox his eyes were unusually light had kind dancing madness them that was both engaging alarming when he took off his great coat he laid pair fine silver mounted pistols on table i saw that he was belted with great sword his manners besides were elegant he pledged captain handsomely altogether i thought him at first sight that here was man i would rather call my friend than my enemy captain too was taking his observations but rather man s clothes than his person be sure as soon as he had taken off great coat he showed forth mighty fine for round house merchant brig having hat with feathers red waistcoat breeches black plush blue coat with silver buttons handsome silver lace costly clothes though somewhat spoiled with fog being slept i m vexed sir about boat says captain there are some pretty men gone bottom said stranger that i would rather see on dry land again than half score boats friends yours said hoseason you have none such friends your country was reply they would have died for me like dogs well sir said captain still watching him there are more men world than boats put them that s true too cried other ye seem be gentleman great penetration i have been france sir says captain so that it was plain he meant more by words than showed upon face them well sir says other so has many pretty man for matter that no doubt sir says captain fine coats oho says stranger is that how wind sets he laid his hand quickly on his pistols don t be hasty said captain don t do mischief before ye see need it ye ve french soldier s coat upon your back scotch tongue your head be sure but so has many honest fellow these days i dare say none worse it so said gentleman fine coat are ye honest party meaning was he jacobite for each side these sort civil broils takes name honesty for its own why sir replied captain i am true blue protestant i thank god for it it was first word any religion i had ever heard from him but i learnt afterwards he was great church goer while on shore but for all that says he i can be sorry see another man with his back wall can ye so indeed asked jacobite well sir be quite plain with ye i am one those honest gentlemen that were trouble about years forty five six be still quite plain with ye if i got into hands any red coated gentry it s like it would go hard with me now sir i was for france there was french ship cruising here pick me up but she gave us go by fog as i wish from heart that ye had done yoursel best that i can say is this if ye can set me ashore where i was going i have that upon me will reward you highly for your trouble france says captain no sir that i cannot do but where ye come from we might talk that then unhappily he observed me standing my corner packed me off galley get supper for gentleman i lost no time i promise you when i came back into round house i found gentleman had taken money belt from about his waist poured out guinea or two upon table captain was looking at guineas then at belt then at gentleman s face i thought he seemed excited half it he cried i m your man other swept back guineas into belt put it on again under his waistcoat i have told ye sir said he that not one doit it belongs me it belongs my chieftain here he touched his hat while i would be but silly messenger grudge some it that rest might come safe i should show myself hound indeed if i bought my own carcase any too dear thirty guineas on sea side or sixty if ye set me on linnhe loch take it if ye will if not ye can do your worst ay said hoseason if i give ye over soldiers ye would make fool s bargain said other my chief let me tell you sir is forfeited like every honest man scotland his estate is hands man they call king george it is his officers that collect rents or try collect them but for honour scotland poor tenant bodies take thought upon their chief lying exile this money is part that very rent for which king george is looking now sir ye seem me be man that understands things bring this money within reach government how much it ll come you little enough be sure said hoseason then if they knew he added drily but i think if i was try that i could hold my tongue about it ah but i ll begowk 12 ye there cried gentleman play me false i ll play you cunning if hand is laid upon me they shall ken what money it is 12 befool well returned captain what must be must sixty guineas done here s my hand upon it here s mine said other thereupon captain went out rather hurriedly i thought left me alone round house with stranger at that period so soon after forty five there were many exiled gentlemen coming back at peril their lives either see their friends or collect little money as for highland chiefs that had been forfeited it was common matter talk how their tenants would stint themselves send them money their clansmen outface soldiery get it run gauntlet our great navy carry it across all this i had course heard tell now i had man under my eyes whose life was forfeit on all these counts upon one more for he was not only rebel smuggler rents but had taken service with king louis france as if all this were not enough he had belt full golden guineas round his loins whatever my opinions i could not look on such man without lively interest so you re jacobite said i as i set meat before him ay said he beginning eat you by your long face should be whig 13 13 whig or whigamore was cant name for those who were loyal king george betwixt between said i not annoy him for indeed i was as good whig as mr campbell could make me that s naething said he but i m saying mr betwixt between he added this bottle yours is dry it s hard if i m pay sixty guineas be grudged dram upon back it i ll go ask for key said i stepped on deck fog was as close as ever but swell almost down they had laid brig not knowing precisely where they were wind what little there was it not serving well for their true course some hands were still hearkening for breakers but captain two officers were waist with their heads together it struck me i don t know why that they were after no good first word i heard as i drew softly near more than confirmed me it was mr riach crying out as if upon sudden thought couldn t we wile him out round house he s better where he is returned hoseason he hasn t room use his sword well that s true said riach but he s hard come at hut said hoseason we can get man talk one upon each side pin him by two arms or if that ll not hold sir we can make run by both doors get him under hand before he has time draw at this hearing i was seized with both fear anger at these treacherous greedy bloody men that i sailed with my first mind was run away my second was bolder captain said i gentleman is seeking dram bottle s out will you give me key they all started turned about why here s our chance get firearms riach cried then me hark ye david he said do ye ken where pistols are ay ay put hoseason david kens david s good lad ye see david my man yon wild hielandman is danger ship besides being rank foe king george god bless him i had never been so be davided since i came on board but i said yes as if all i heard were quite natural trouble is resumed captain that all our firelocks great little are round house under this man s nose likewise powder now if i or one officers was go take them he would fall thinking but lad like you david might snap up horn pistol or two without remark if ye can do it cleverly i ll bear it mind when it ll be good for you have friends that s when we come carolina here mr riach whispered him little very right sir said captain then myself see here david yon man has beltful gold i give you my word that you shall have your fingers it i told him i would do as he wished though indeed i had scarce breath speak with upon that he gave me key spirit locker i began go slowly back round house what was i do they were dogs thieves they had stolen me from my own country they had killed poor ransome was i hold candle another murder but then upon other hand there was fear death very plain before me for what could boy man if they were as brave as lions against whole ship s company i was still arguing it back forth getting no great clearness when i came into round house saw jacobite eating his supper under lamp at that my mind was made up all moment i have no credit by it it was by no choice mine but as if by compulsion that i walked right up table put my hand on his shoulder do ye want be killed said i he sprang his feet looked question at me as clear as if he had spoken o cried i they re all murderers here it s ship full them they ve murdered boy already now it s you ay ay said he but they have n t got me yet then looking at me curiously will ye stand with me that will i said i i am no thief nor yet murderer i ll stand by you why then said he what s your name david balfour said i then thinking that man with so fine coat must like fine people i added for first time shaws it never occurred him doubt me for highlander is used see great gentlefolk great poverty but as he had no estate his own my words nettled very childish vanity he had my name is stewart he said drawing himself up alan breck they call me king s name is good enough for me though i bear it plain have name no farm midden clap hind end it having administered this rebuke as though it were something chief importance he turned examine our defences round house was built very strong support breaching seas its five apertures only skylight two doors were large enough for passage man doors besides could be drawn close they were stout oak ran grooves were fitted with hooks keep them either shut or open as need arose one that was already shut i secured this fashion but when i was proceeding slide other alan stopped me david said he for i cannae bring mind name your landed estate so will make so bold as call you david that door being open is best part my defences it would be yet better shut says i not so david says he ye see i have but one face but so long as that door is open my face it best part my enemies will be front me where i would aye wish find them then he gave me from rack cutlass which there were few besides firearms choosing it with great care shaking his head saying he had never all his life seen poorer weapons next he set me down table with powder horn bag bullets all pistols which he bade me charge that will be better work let me tell you said he for gentleman decent birth than scraping plates raxing 14 drams wheen tarry sailors 14 reaching thereupon he stood up midst with his face door drawing his great sword made trial room he had wield it i must stick point he said shaking his head that s pity too it doesn t set my genius which is all for upper guard now said he do you keep on charging pistols give heed me i told him i would listen closely my chest was tight my mouth dry light dark my eyes thought numbers that were soon leap upon us kept my heart flutter sea which i heard washing round brig where i thought my dead body would be cast ere morning ran my mind strangely first all said he how many are against us i reckoned them up such was hurry my mind i had cast numbers twice fifteen said i alan whistled well said he that can t be cured now follow me it is my part keep this door where i look for main battle that ye have no hand mind dinnae fire this side unless they get me down for i would rather have ten foes front me than one friend like you cracking pistols at my back i told him indeed i was no great shot that s very bravely said he cried great admiration my candour there s many pretty gentleman that wouldnae dare say it but then sir said i there is door behind you which they may perhaps break ay said he that is part your work no sooner pistols charged than ye must climb up into yon bed where ye re handy at window if they lift hand against door ye re shoot but that s not all let s make bit soldier ye david what else have ye guard there s skylight said i but indeed mr stewart i would need have eyes upon both sides keep two them for when my face is at one my back is other that s very true said alan but have ye no ears your head be sure cried i i must hear bursting glass ye have some rudiments sense said alan grimly chapter x siege round house but now our time truce was come end those on deck had waited for my coming till they grew impatient scarce had alan spoken when captain showed face open door stand cried alan pointed his sword at him captain stood indeed but he neither winced nor drew back foot naked sword says he this is strange return for hospitality do ye see me said alan i am come kings i bear king s name my badge is oak do ye see my sword it has slashed heads off mair whigamores than you have toes upon your feet call up your vermin your back sir fall on sooner clash begins sooner ye ll taste this steel throughout your vitals captain said nothing alan but he looked over at me with ugly look david said he i ll mind this sound his voice went through me with jar next moment he was gone now said alan let your hand keep your head for grip is coming alan drew dirk which he held his left hand case they should run under his sword i on my part clambered up into berth with armful pistols something heavy heart set open window where i was watch it was small part deck that i could overlook but enough for our purpose sea had gone down wind was steady kept sails quiet so that there was great stillness ship which i made sure i heard sound muttering voices little after there came clash steel upon deck by which i knew they were dealing out cutlasses one had been let fall after that silence again i do not know if i was what you call afraid but my heart beat like bird s both quick little there was dimness came before my eyes which i continually rubbed away which continually returned as for hope i had none but only darkness despair sort anger against all world that made me long sell my life as dear as i was able i tried pray i remember but that same hurry my mind like man running would not suffer me think upon words my chief wish was have thing begin be done with it it came all sudden when it did with rush feet roar then shout from alan sound blows some one crying out as if hurt i looked back over my shoulder saw mr shuan doorway crossing blades with alan that s him that killed boy i cried look your window said alan as i turned back my place i saw him pass his sword through mate s body it was none too soon for me look my own part for my head was scarce back at window before five men carrying spare yard for battering ram ran past me took post drive door i had never fired with pistol my life not often with gun far less against fellow creature but it was now or never just as they swang yard i cried out take that shot into their midst i must have hit one them for he sang out gave back step rest stopped as if little disconcerted before they had time recover i sent another ball over their heads at my third shot which went as wide as second whole party threw down yard ran for it then i looked round again into deck house whole place was full smoke my own firing just as my ears seemed be burst with noise shots but there was alan standing as before only now his sword was running blood hilt himself so swelled with triumph fallen into so fine attitude that he looked be invincible right before him on floor was mr shuan on his hands knees blood was pouring from his mouth he was sinking slowly lower with terrible white face just as i looked some those from behind caught hold him by heels dragged him bodily out round house i believe he died as they were doing it there s one your whigs for ye cried alan then turning me he asked if i had done much execution i told him i had winged one thought it was captain i ve settled two says he no there s not enough blood let they ll be back again your watch david this was but dram before meat i settled back my place re charging three pistols i had fired keeping watch with both eye ear our enemies were disputing not far off upon deck that so loudly that i could hear word or two above washing seas it was shuan bauchled 15 it i heard one say 15 bungled another answered him with wheesht man he s paid piper after that voices fell again into same muttering as before only now one person spoke most time as though laying down plan first one then another answered him briefly like men taking orders by this i made sure they were coming on again told alan it s what we have pray for said he unless we can give them good distaste us done with it there ll be nae sleep for either you or me but this time mind they ll be earnest by this my pistols were ready there was nothing do but listen wait while brush lasted i had not time think if i was frighted but now when all was still again my mind ran upon nothing else thought sharp swords cold steel was strong me presently when i began hear stealthy steps brushing men s clothes against round house wall knew they were taking their places dark i could have found it my mind cry out aloud all this was upon alan s side i had begun think my share fight was at end when i heard some one drop softly on roof above me then there came single call on sea pipe that was signal knot them made one rush it cutlass hand against door at same moment glass skylight was dashed thousand pieces man leaped through landed on floor before he got his feet i had clapped pistol his back might have shot him too only at touch him him alive my whole flesh misgave me i could no more pull trigger than i could have flown he had dropped his cutlass as he jumped when he felt pistol whipped straight round laid hold me roaring out oath at that either my courage came again or i grew so much afraid as came same thing for i gave shriek shot him midst body he gave most horrible ugly groan fell floor foot second fellow whose legs were dangling through skylight struck me at same time upon head at that i snatched another pistol shot this one through thigh so that he slipped through tumbled lump on his companion s body there was no talk missing any more than there was time aim i clapped muzzle very place fired i might have stood stared at them for long but i heard alan shout as if for help that brought me my senses he had kept door so long but one seamen while he was engaged with others had run under his guard caught him about body alan was dirking him with his left hand but fellow clung like leech another had broken had his cutlass raised door was thronged with their faces i thought we were lost catching up my cutlass fell on them flank but i had not time be help wrestler dropped at last alan leaping back get his distance ran upon others like bull roaring as he went they broke before him like water turning running falling one against another their haste sword his hands flashed like quicksilver into huddle our fleeing enemies at every flash there came scream man hurt i was still thinking we were lost when lo they were all gone alan was driving them along deck as sheep dog chases sheep yet he was no sooner out than he was back again being as cautious as he was brave meanwhile seamen continued running crying out as if he was still behind them we heard them tumble one upon another into forecastle clap hatch upon top round house was like shambles three were dead inside another lay his death agony across threshold there were alan i victorious unhurt he came up me with open arms come my arms he cried embraced kissed me hard upon both cheeks david said he i love you like brother o man he cried kind ecstasy am i no bonny fighter thereupon he turned four enemies passed his sword clean through each them tumbled them out doors one after other as he did so he kept humming singing whistling himself like man trying recall air only what he was trying was make one all while flush was his face his eyes were as bright as five year old child s with new toy presently he sat down upon table sword hand air that he was making all time began run little clearer then clearer still then out he burst with great voice into gaelic song i have translated it here not verse which i have no skill but at least king s english he sang it often afterwards thing became popular so that i have heard it had it explained me many s time this is song sword alan smith made it fire set it now it shines hand alan breck their eyes were many bright swift were they behold many hands they guided sword was alone dun deer troop over hill they are many hill is one dun deer vanish hill remains come me from hills heather come from isles sea o far beholding eagles here is your meat now this song which he made both words music hour our victory is something less than just me who stood beside him tussle mr shuan five more were either killed outright or thoroughly disabled but these two fell by my hand two that came by skylight four more were hurt that number one he not least important got his hurt from me so that altogether i did my fair share both killing wounding might have claimed place alan s verses but poets have think upon their rhymes good prose talk alan always did me more than justice meanwhile i was innocent any wrong being done me for not only i knew no word gaelic but what with long suspense waiting scurry strain our two spirts fighting more than all horror i had some my own share it thing was no sooner over than i was glad stagger seat there was that tightness on my chest that i could hardly breathe thought two men i had shot sat upon me like nightmare all upon sudden before i had guess what was coming i began sob cry like any child alan clapped my shoulder said i was brave lad wanted nothing but sleep i ll take first watch said he ye ve done well by me david first last i wouldn t lose you for all appin no nor for breadalbane so i made up my bed on floor he took first spell pistol hand sword on knee three hours by captain s watch upon wall then he roused me up i took my turn three hours before end which it was broad day very quiet morning with smooth rolling sea that tossed ship made blood run fro on round house floor heavy rain that drummed upon roof all my watch there was nothing stirring by banging helm i knew they had even no one at tiller indeed as i learned afterwards there were so many them hurt or dead rest so ill temper that mr riach captain had take turn turn like alan me or brig might have gone ashore nobody wiser it was mercy night had fallen so still for wind had gone down as soon as rain began even as it was i judged by wailing great number gulls that went crying fishing round ship that she must have drifted pretty near coast or one islands hebrides at last looking out door round house i saw great stone hills skye on right hand little more astern strange isle rum chapter xi captain knuckles under alan i sat down breakfast about six clock floor was covered with broken glass horrid mess blood which took away my hunger all other ways we were situation not only agreeable but merry having ousted officers from their own cabin having at command all drink ship both wine spirits all dainty part what was eatable such as pickles fine sort bread this itself was enough set us good humour but richest part it was this that two thirstiest men that ever came out scotland mr shuan being dead were now shut fore part ship condemned what they hated most cold water depend upon it alan said we shall hear more them ere long ye may keep man from fighting but never from his bottle we made good company for each other alan indeed expressed himself most lovingly taking knife from table cut me off one silver buttons from his coat i had them says he from my father duncan stewart now give ye one them be keepsake for last night s work wherever ye go show that button friends alan breck will come around you he said this as if he had been charlemagne commanded armies indeed much as i admired his courage i was always danger smiling at his vanity danger i say for had i not kept my countenance i would be afraid think what quarrel might have followed as soon as we were through with our meal he rummaged captain s locker till he found clothes brush then taking off his coat began visit his suit brush away stains with such care labour as i supposed have been only usual with women be sure he had no other besides as he said it belonged king so behoved be royally looked after for all that when i saw what care he took pluck out threads where button had been cut away i put higher value on his gift he was still so engaged when we were hailed by mr riach from deck asking for parley i climbing through skylight sitting on edge it pistol hand with bold front though inwardly fear broken glass hailed him back again bade him speak out he came edge round house stood on coil rope so that his chin was on level with roof we looked at each other awhile silence mr riach as i do not think he had been very forward battle so he had got off with nothing worse than blow upon cheek but he looked out heart very weary having been all night afoot either standing watch or doctoring wounded this is bad job said he at last shaking his head it was none our choosing said i captain says he would like speak with your friend they might speak at window how do we know what treachery he means cried i he means none david returned mr riach if he did i ll tell ye honest truth we couldnae get men follow is that so said i i ll tell ye more than that said he it s not only men it s me i m frich ened davie he smiled across at me no he continued what we want is be shut him thereupon i consulted with alan parley was agreed parole given upon either side but this was not whole mr riach s business he now begged me for dram with such instancy such reminders his former kindness that at last i handed him pannikin with about gill brandy he drank part then carried rest down upon deck share it i suppose with his superior little after captain came as was agreed one windows stood there rain with his arm sling looking stern pale so old that my heart smote me for having fired upon him alan at once held pistol his face put that thing up said captain have i not passed my word sir or do ye seek affront me captain says alan i doubt your word is breakable last night ye haggled argle bargled like apple wife then passed me your word gave me your hand back it ye ken very well what was upshot be damned your word says he well well sir said captain ye ll get little good by swearing truly that was fault which captain was quite free but we have other things speak he continued bitterly ye ve made sore hash my brig i haven t hands enough left work her my

quit memorials those whom we had slain captain mr riach could be happy again their own way name which was drink chapter xii i hear red fox before we had done cleaning out round house breeze sprang up from little east north this blew off rain brought out sun here i must explain reader would do well look at map on day when fog fell we ran down alan s boat we had been running through little minch at dawn after battle we lay becalmed east isle canna or between that isle eriska chain long island now get from there linnhe loch straight course was through narrows sound mull but captain had no chart he was afraid trust his brig so deep among islands wind serving well he preferred go by west tiree come up under southern coast great isle mull all day breeze held same point rather freshened than died down towards afternoon swell began set from round outer hebrides our course go round about inner isles was west south so that at first we had this swell upon our beam were much rolled about but after nightfall when we had turned end tiree began head more east sea came right astern meanwhile early part day before swell came up was very pleasant sailing as we were bright sunshine with many mountainous islands upon different sides alan i sat round house with doors open on each side wind being straight astern smoked pipe or two captain s fine tobacco it was at this time we heard each other s stories which was more important me as i gained some knowledge that wild highland country on which i was so soon land those days so close on back great rebellion it was needful man should know what he was doing when he went upon heather it was i that showed example telling him all my misfortune which he heard with great good nature only when i came mention that good friend mine mr campbell minister alan fired up cried out that he hated all that were that name why said i he is man you should be proud give your hand i know nothing i would help campbell says he unless it was leaden bullet i would hunt all that name like blackcocks if i lay dying i would crawl upon my knees my chamber window for shot at one why alan i cried what ails ye at campbells well says he ye ken very well that i am appin stewart campbells have long harried wasted those my name ay got lands us by treachery but never with sword he cried loudly with word brought down his fist upon table but i paid less attention this for i knew it was usually said by those who have underhand there s more than that he continued all same story lying words lying papers tricks fit for peddler show what s legal over all make man more angry you that are so wasteful your buttons said i i can hardly think you would be good judge business ah says he falling again smiling i got my wastefulness from same man i got buttons from that was my poor father duncan stewart grace be him he was prettiest man his kindred best swordsman hielands david that is same as say all world i should ken for it was him that taught me he was black watch when first it was mustered like other gentlemen privates had gillie at his back carry his firelock for him on march well king it appears was wishful see hieland swordsmanship my father three more were chosen out sent london town let him see it at best so they were had into palace showed whole art sword for two hours at stretch before king george queen carline butcher cumberland many more whom i havenae mind when they were through king for all he was rank usurper spoke them fair gave each man three guineas his hand now as they were going out palace they had porter s lodge go by it came on my father as he was perhaps first private hieland gentleman that had ever gone by that door it was right he should give poor porter proper notion their quality so he gives king s three guineas into man s hand as if it was his common custom three others that came behind him did same there they were on street never penny better for their pains some say it was one that was first fee king s porter some say it was another but truth it is that it was duncan stewart as i am willing prove with either sword or pistol that was father that i had god rest him i think he was not man leave you rich said i that s true said alan he left me my breeks cover me little besides that was how i came enlist which was black spot upon my character at best times would still be sore job for me if i fell among red coats what cried i were you english army that was i said alan but i deserted right side at preston pans that s some comfort i could scarcely share this view holding desertion under arms for unpardonable fault honour but for all i was so young i was wiser than say my thought dear dear says i punishment is death ay said he if they got hands on me it would be short shrift lang tow for alan but i have king france s commission my pocket which would aye be some protection i misdoubt it much said i i have doubts mysel said alan drily good heaven man cried i you that are condemned rebel deserter man french king s what tempts ye back into this country it s braving providence tut says alan i have been back every year since forty six what brings ye man cried i well ye see i weary for my friends country said he france is braw place nae doubt but i weary for heather deer then i have bit things that i attend whiles i pick up few lads serve king france recruits ye see that s aye little money but heart matter is business my chief ardshiel i thought they called your chief appin said i ay but ardshiel is captain clan said he which scarcely cleared my mind ye see david he that was all his life so great man come blood bearing name kings is now brought down live french town like poor private person he that had four hundred swords at his whistle i have seen with these eyes mine buying butter market place taking it home kale leaf this is not only pain but disgrace us his family clan there are bairns forby children hope appin that must be learned their letters how hold sword that far country now tenants appin have pay rent king george but their hearts are staunch they are true their chief what with love bit pressure maybe threat or two poor folk scrape up second rent for ardshiel well david i m hand that carries it he struck belt about his body so that guineas rang do they pay both cried i ay david both says he what two rents i repeated ay david said he i told different tale yon captain man but this is truth it it s wonderful me how little pressure is needed but that s handiwork my good kinsman my father s friend james glens james stewart that is ardshiel s half brother he it is that gets money does management this was first time i heard name that james stewart who was afterwards so famous at time his hanging but i took little heed at moment for all my mind was occupied with generosity these poor highlanders i call it noble i cried i m whig or little better but i call it noble ay said he ye re whig but ye re gentleman that s what does it now if ye were one cursed race campbell ye would gnash your teeth hear tell it if ye were red fox at that name his teeth shut together he ceased speaking i have seen many grim face but never grimmer than alan s when he had named red fox who is red fox i asked daunted but still curious who is he cried alan well i ll tell you that when men clans were broken at culloden good cause went down horses rode over fetlocks best blood north ardshiel had flee like poor deer upon mountains he his lady his bairns sair job we had it before we got him shipped while he still lay heather english rogues that couldnae come at his life were striking at his rights they stripped him his powers they stripped him his lands they plucked weapons from hands his clansmen that had borne arms for thirty centuries ay very clothes off their backs so that it s now sin wear tartan plaid man may be cast into gaol if he has but kilt about his legs one thing they couldnae kill that was love clansmen bore their chief these guineas are proof it now there steps man campbell red headed colin glenure is that him you call red fox said i will ye bring me his brush cries alan fiercely ay that s man he steps gets papers from king george be so called king s factor on lands appin at first he sings small is hail fellow well met with sheamus that s james glens my chieftain s agent but by by that came his ears that i have just told you how poor commons appin farmers crofters boumen were wringing their very plaids get second rent send it over seas for ardshiel his poor bairns what was it ye called it when i told ye i called it noble alan said i you little better than common whig cries alan but when it came colin roy black campbell blood him ran wild he sat gnashing his teeth at wine table what should stewart get bite bread him not be able prevent it ah red fox if ever i hold you at gun s end lord have pity upon ye alan stopped swallow down his anger well david what does he do he declares all farms let thinks he his black heart i ll soon get other tenants that ll overbid these stewarts maccolls macrobs for these are all names my clan david then thinks he ardshiel will have hold his bonnet on french roadside well said i what followed alan laid down his pipe which he had long since suffered go out set his two hands upon his knees ay said he ye ll never guess that for these same stewarts maccolls macrobs that had two rents pay one king george by stark force one ardshiel by natural kindness offered him better price than any campbell all broad scotland far he sent seeking them as far as sides clyde cross edinburgh seeking fleeching begging them come where there was stewart be starved red headed hound campbell be pleasured well alan said i that is strange story fine one too whig as i may be i am glad man was beaten him beaten echoed alan it s little ye ken campbells less red fox him beaten no nor will be till his blood s on hillside but if day comes david man that i can find time leisure for bit hunting there grows not enough heather all scotland hide him from my vengeance man alan said i ye are neither very wise nor very christian blow off so many words anger they will do man ye call fox no harm yourself no good tell me your tale plainly out what did he next that s good observe david said alan troth indeed they will do him no harm more s pity barring that about christianity which my opinion is quite otherwise or i would be nae christian i am much your mind opinion here or opinion there said i it s kent thing that christianity forbids revenge ay said he it s well seen it was campbell taught ye it would be convenient world for them their sort if there was no such thing as lad gun behind heather bush but that s nothing point this is what he did ay said i come that well david said he since he couldnae be rid loyal commons by fair means he swore he would be rid them by foul ardshiel was starve that was thing he aimed at since them that fed him his exile wouldnae be bought out right or wrong he would drive them out therefore he sent for lawyers papers red coats stand at his back kindly folk that country must all pack tramp every father s son out his father s house out place where he was bred fed played when he was callant who are succeed them bare leggit beggars king george is whistle for his rents he maun dow with less he can spread his butter thinner what cares red colin if he can hurt ardshiel he has his wish if he can pluck meat from my chieftain s table bit toys out his children s hands he will gang hame singing glenure let me have word said i be sure if they take less rents be sure government has finger pie it s not this campbell s fault man it s his orders if ye killed this colin morrow what better would ye be there would be another factor his shoes as fast as spur can drive ye re good lad fight said alan but man ye have whig blood ye he spoke kindly enough but there was so much anger under his contempt that i thought it was wise change conversation i expressed my wonder how with highlands covered with troops guarded like city siege man his situation could come go without arrest it s easier than ye would think said alan bare hillside ye see is like all one road if there s sentry at one place ye just go by another then heather s great help everywhere there are friends houses friends byres haystacks besides when folk talk country covered with troops it s but kind byword at best soldier covers nae mair it than his boot soles i have fished water with sentry on other side brae killed fine trout i have sat heather bush within six feet another learned real bonny tune from his whistling this was it said he whistled me air then besides he continued it s no sae bad now as it was forty six hielands are what they call pacified small wonder with never gun or sword left from cantyre cape wrath but what tenty 17 folk have hidden their thatch but what i would like ken david is just how long not long ye would think with men like ardshiel exile men like red fox sitting birling wine oppressing poor at home but it s kittle thing decide what folk ll bear what they will not or why would red colin be riding his horse all over my poor country appin never pretty lad put bullet him 17 careful with this alan fell into muse for long time sate very sad silent i will add rest what i have say about my friend that he was skilled all kinds music but principally pipe music was well considered poet his own tongue had read several books both french english was dead shot good angler excellent fencer with small sword as well as with his own particular weapon for his faults they were on his face i now knew them all but worst them his childish propensity take offence pick quarrels he greatly laid aside my case out regard for battle round house but whether it was because i had done well myself or because i had been witness his own much greater prowess is more than i can tell for though he had great taste for courage other men yet he admired it most alan breck chapter xiii loss brig it was already late at night as dark as it ever would be at that season year that is say it was still pretty bright when hoseason clapped his head into round house door here said he come out see if ye can pilot is this one your tricks asked alan do i look like tricks cries captain i have other things think my brig s danger by concerned look his face above all by sharp tones which he spoke his brig it was plain both us he was deadly earnest so alan i with no great fear treachery stepped on deck sky was clear it blew hard was bitter cold great deal daylight lingered moon which was nearly full shone brightly brig was close hauled so as round southwest corner island mull hills which ben more above them all with wisp mist upon top it lay full upon lar board bow though it was no good point sailing for covenant she tore through seas at great rate pitching straining pursued by westerly swell altogether it was no such ill night keep seas i had begun wonder what it was that sat so heavily upon captain when brig rising suddenly on top high swell he pointed cried us look away on lee bow thing like fountain rose out moonlit sea immediately after we heard low sound roaring what do ye call that asked captain gloomily sea breaking on reef said alan now ye ken where it is what better would ye have ay said hoseason if it was only one sure enough just as he spoke there came second fountain farther south there said hoseason ye see for yourself if i had kent these reefs if i had had chart or if shuan had been spared it s not sixty guineas no nor six hundred would have made me risk my brig sic stoneyard but you sir that was pilot us have ye never word i m thinking said alan these ll be what they call torran rocks are there many them says captain truly sir i am nae pilot said alan but it sticks my mind there are ten miles them mr riach captain looked at each other there s way through them i suppose said captain doubtless said alan but where but it somehow runs my mind once more that it is clearer under land so said hoseason we ll have haul our wind then mr riach we ll have come as near about end mull as we can take her sir even then we ll have land kep wind off us that stoneyard on our lee well we re for it now may as well crack on with that he gave order steersman sent riach foretop there were only five men on deck counting officers these being all that were fit or at least both fit willing for their work so as i say it fell mr riach go aloft he sat there looking out hailing deck with news all he saw sea south is thick he cried then after while it does seem clearer by land well sir said hoseason alan we ll try your way it but i think i might as well trust blind fiddler pray god you re right pray god i am says alan me but where did i hear it well well it will be as it must as we got nearer turn land reefs began be sown here there on our very path mr riach sometimes cried down us change course sometimes indeed none too soon for one reef was so close on brig s weather board that when sea burst upon it lighter sprays fell upon her deck wetted us like rain brightness night showed us these perils as clearly as by day which was perhaps more alarming it showed me too face captain as he stood by steersman now on one foot now on other sometimes blowing his hands but still listening looking as steady as steel neither he nor mr riach had shown well fighting but i saw they were brave their own trade admired them all more because i found alan very white ochone david says he this is no kind death i fancy what alan i cried you re not afraid no said he wetting his lips but you ll allow yourself it s cold ending by this time now then sheering one side or other avoid reef but still hugging wind land we had got round iona begun come alongside mull tide at tail land ran very strong threw brig about two hands were put helm hoseason himself would sometimes lend help it was strange see three strong men throw their weight upon tiller it like living thing struggle against drive them back this would have been greater danger had not sea been for some while free obstacles mr riach besides announced from top that he saw clear water ahead ye were right said hoseason alan ye have saved brig sir i ll mind that when we come clear accounts i believe he not only meant what he said but would have done it so high place did covenant hold his affections but this is matter only for conjecture things having gone otherwise than he forecast keep her away point sings out mr riach reef windward just at same time tide caught brig threw wind out her sails she came round into wind like top next moment struck reef with such dunch as threw us all flat upon deck came near shake mr riach from his place upon mast i was on my feet minute reef on which we had struck was close under southwest end mull off little isle they call earraid which lay low black upon larboard sometimes swell broke clean over us sometimes it only ground poor brig upon reef so that we could hear her beat herself pieces what with great noise sails singing wind flying spray moonlight sense danger i think my head must have been partly turned for i could scarcely understand things i saw presently i observed mr riach seamen busy round skiff still same blank ran over assist them as soon as i set my hand work my mind came clear again it was no very easy task for skiff lay amidships was full hamper breaking heavier seas continually forced us give over hold on but we all wrought like horses while we could meanwhile such wounded as could move came clambering out fore scuttle began help while rest that lay helpless their bunks harrowed me with screaming begging be saved captain took no part it seemed he was struck stupid he stood holding by shrouds talking himself groaning out aloud whenever ship hammered on rock his brig was like wife child him he had looked on day by day at mishandling poor ransome but when it came brig he seemed suffer along with her all time our working at boat i remember only one other thing that i asked alan looking across at shore what country it was he answered it was worst possible for him for it was land campbells we had one wounded men told off keep watch upon seas cry us warning well we had boat about ready be launched when this man sang out pretty shrill for god s sake hold on we knew by his tone that it was something more than ordinary sure enough there followed sea so huge that it lifted brig right up canted her over on her beam whether cry came too late or my hold was too weak i know not but at sudden tilting ship i was cast clean over bulwarks into sea i went down drank my fill then came up got blink moon then down again they say man sinks third time for good i cannot be made like other folk then for i would not like write how often i went down or how often i came up again all while i was being hurled along beaten upon choked then swallowed whole thing was so distracting my wits that i was neither sorry nor afraid presently i found i was holding spar which helped me somewhat then all sudden i was quiet water began come myself it was spare yard i had got hold i was amazed see how far i had travelled from brig i hailed her indeed but it was plain she was already out cry she was still holding together but whether or not they had yet launched boat i was too far off too low down see while i was hailing brig i spied tract water lying between us where no great waves came but which yet boiled white all over bristled moon with rings bubbles sometimes whole tract swung one side like tail live serpent sometimes for glimpse it would all disappear then boil up again what it was i had no guess which for time increased my fear it but i now know it must have been roost or tide race which had carried me away so fast tumbled me about so cruelly at last as if tired that play had flung out me spare yard upon its landward margin i now lay quite becalmed began feel that man can die cold as well as drowning shores earraid were close i could see moonlight dots heather sparkling mica rocks well thought i myself if i cannot get as far as that it s strange i had no skill swimming essen water being small our neighbourhood but when i laid hold upon yard with both arms kicked out with both feet i soon begun find that i was moving hard work it was mortally slow but about hour kicking splashing i had got well between points sandy bay surrounded by low hills sea was here quite quiet there was no sound any surf moon shone clear i thought my heart i had never seen place so desert desolate but it was dry land when at last it grew so shallow that i could leave yard wade ashore upon my feet i cannot tell if i was more tired or more grateful both at least i was tired as i never was before that night grateful god as i trust i have been often though never with more cause chapter xiv islet with my stepping ashore i began most unhappy part my adventures it was half past twelve morning though wind was broken by land it was cold night i dared not sit down for i thought i should have frozen but took off my shoes walked fro upon sand bare foot beating my breast with infinite weariness there was no sound man or cattle not cock crew though it was about hour their first waking only surf broke outside distance which put me mind my perils those my friend walk by sea at that hour morning place so desert like lonesome struck me with kind fear as soon as day began break i put on my shoes climbed hill ruggedest scramble i ever undertook falling whole way between big blocks granite or leaping from one another when i got top dawn was come there was no sign brig which must have lifted from reef sunk boat too was nowhere be seen there was never sail upon ocean what i could see land was neither house nor man i was afraid think what had befallen my shipmates afraid look longer at so empty scene what with my wet clothes weariness my belly that now began ache with hunger i had enough trouble me without that so i set off eastward along south coast hoping find house where i might warm myself perhaps get news those i had lost at worst i considered sun would soon rise dry my clothes after little my way was stopped by creek or inlet sea which seemed run pretty deep into land as i had no means get across i must needs change my direction go about end it it was still roughest kind walking indeed whole not only earraid but neighbouring part mull which they call ross is nothing but jumble granite rocks with heather among at first creek kept narrowing as i had looked see but presently my surprise it began widen out again at this i scratched my head but had still no notion truth until at last i came rising ground it burst upon me all moment that i was cast upon little barren isle cut off on every side by salt seas instead sun rising dry me it came on rain with thick mist so that my case was lamentable i stood rain shivered wondered what do till it occurred me that perhaps creek was fordable back i went narrowest point waded but not three yards from shore i plumped head over ears if ever i was heard more it was rather by god s grace than my own prudence i was no wetter for that could hardly be but i was all colder for this mishap having lost another hope was more unhappy now all at once yard came my head what had carried me through roost would surely serve me cross this little quiet creek safety with that i set off undaunted across top isle fetch carry it back it was weary tramp all ways if hope had not buoyed me up i must have cast myself down given up whether with sea salt or because i was growing fevered i was distressed with thirst had stop as i went drink peaty water out hags i came bay at last more dead than alive at first glance i thought yard was something farther out than when i left it i went for third time into sea sand was smooth firm shelved gradually down so that i could wade out till water was almost my neck little waves splashed into my face but at that depth my feet began leave me i durst venture no farther as for yard i saw it bobbing very quietly some twenty feet beyond i had borne up well until this last disappointment but at that i came ashore flung myself down upon sands wept time i spent upon island is still so horrible thought me that i must pass it lightly over all books i have read people cast away they had either their pockets full tools or chest things would be thrown upon beach along with them as if on purpose my case was very different i had nothing my pockets but money alan s silver button being inland bred i was as much short knowledge as means i knew indeed that shell fish were counted good eat among rocks isle i found great plenty limpets which at first i could scarcely strike from their places not knowing quickness be needful there were besides some little shells that we call buckies i think periwinkle is english name these two i made my whole diet devouring them cold raw as i found them so hungry was i that at first they seemed me delicious perhaps they were out season or perhaps there was something wrong sea about my island but at least i had no sooner eaten my first meal than i was seized with giddiness retching lay for long time no better than dead second trial same food indeed i had no other did better with me revived my strength but as long as i was on island i never knew what expect when i had eaten sometimes all was well sometimes i was thrown into miserable sickness nor could i ever distinguish what particular fish it was that hurt me all day it streamed rain island ran like sop there was no dry spot be found when i lay down that night between two boulders that made kind roof my feet were bog second day i crossed island all sides there was no one part it better than another it was all desolate rocky nothing living on it but game birds which i lacked means kill gulls which haunted outlying rocks prodigious number but creek or strait that cut off isle from main land ross opened out on north into bay bay again opened into sound iona it was neighbourhood this place that i chose be my home though if i had thought upon very name home such spot i must have burst out weeping i had good reasons for my choice there was this part isle little hut house like pig s hut where fishers used sleep when they came there upon their business but turf roof it had fallen entirely so that hut was no use me gave me less shelter than my rocks what was more important shell fish on which i lived grew there great plenty when tide was out i could gather peck at time this was doubtless convenience but other reason went deeper i had become no way used horrid solitude isle but still looked round me on all sides like man that was hunted between fear hope that i might see some human creature coming now from little up hillside over bay i could catch sight great ancient church roofs people s houses iona on other hand over low country ross i saw smoke go up morning evening as if from homestead hollow land i used watch this smoke when i was wet cold had my head half turned with loneliness think fireside company till my heart burned it was same with roofs iona altogether this sight i had men s homes comfortable lives although it put point on my own sufferings yet it kept hope alive helped me eat my raw shell fish which had soon grown be disgust saved me from sense horror i had whenever i was quite alone with dead rocks fowls rain cold sea i say it kept hope alive indeed it seemed impossible that i should be left die on shores my own country within view church tower smoke men s houses but second day passed though as long as light lasted i kept bright look out for boats on sound or men passing on ross no help came near me it still rained i turned sleep as wet as ever with cruel sore throat but little comforted perhaps by having said good night my next neighbours people iona charles second declared man could stay outdoors more days year climate england than any other this was very like king with palace at his back changes dry clothes but he must have had better luck on his flight from worcester than i had on that miserable isle it was height summer yet it rained for more than twenty four hours did not clear until afternoon third day this was day incidents morning i saw red deer buck with fine spread antlers standing rain on top island but he had scarce seen me rise from under my rock before he trotted off upon other side i supposed he must have swum strait though what should bring any creature earraid was more than i could fancy little after as i was jumping about after my limpets i was startled by guinea piece which fell upon rock front me glanced off into sea when sailors gave me my money again they kept back not only about third whole sum but my father s leather purse so that from that day out i carried my gold loose pocket with button i now saw there must be hole clapped my hand place great hurry but this was lock stable door after steed was stolen i had left shore at queensferry with near on fifty pounds now i found no more than two guinea pieces silver shilling it is true i picked up third guinea little after where it lay shining on piece turf that made fortune three pounds four shillings english money for lad rightful heir estate now starving on isle at extreme end wild highlands this state my affairs dashed me still further indeed my plight on that third morning was truly pitiful my clothes were beginning rot my stockings particular were quite worn through so that my shanks went naked my hands had grown quite soft with continual soaking my throat was very sore my strength had much abated my heart so turned against horrid stuff i was condemned eat that very sight it came near sicken me yet worst was not yet come there is pretty high rock on northwest earraid which because it had flat top overlooked sound i was much habit frequenting not that ever i stayed one place save when asleep my misery giving me no rest indeed i wore myself down with continual aimless goings comings rain as soon however as sun came out i lay down on top that rock dry myself comfort sunshine is thing i cannot tell it set me thinking hopefully my deliverance which i had begun despair i scanned sea ross with fresh interest on south my rock part island jutted out hid open ocean so that boat could thus come quite near me upon that side i be none wiser well all sudden coble with brown sail pair fishers aboard it came flying round that corner isle bound for iona i shouted out then fell on my knees on rock reached up my hands prayed them they were near enough hear i could even see colour their hair there was no doubt but they observed me for they cried out gaelic tongue laughed but boat never turned aside flew on right before my eyes for iona i could not believe such wickedness ran along shore from rock rock crying on them piteously even after they were out reach my voice i still cried waved them when they were quite gone i thought my heart would have burst all time my troubles i wept only twice once when i could not reach yard now second time when these fishers turned deaf ear my cries but this time i wept roared like wicked child tearing up turf with my nails grinding my face earth if wish would kill men those two fishers would never have seen morning i should likely have died upon my island when i was little over my anger i must eat again but with such loathing mess as i could now scarce control sure enough i should have done as well fast for my fishes poisoned me again i had all my first pains my throat was so sore i could scarce swallow i had fit strong shuddering which clucked my teeth together there came on me that dreadful sense illness which we have no name for either scotch or english i thought i should have died made my peace with god forgiving all men even my uncle fishers as soon as i had thus made up my mind worst clearness came upon me i observed night was falling dry my clothes were dried good deal truly i was better case than ever before since i had landed on isle so i got sleep at last with thought gratitude next day which was fourth this horrible life mine i found my bodily strength run very low but sun shone air was sweet what i managed eat shell fish agreed well with me revived my courage i was scarce back on my rock where i went always first thing after i had eaten before i observed boat coming down sound with her head as i thought my direction i began at once hope fear exceedingly for i thought these men might have thought better their cruelty be coming back my assistance but another disappointment such as yesterday s was more than i could bear i turned my back accordingly upon sea did not look again till i had counted many hundreds boat was still heading for island next time i counted full thousand as slowly as i could my heart beating so as hurt me then it was out all question she was coming straight earraid i could no longer hold myself back but ran seaside out from one rock another as far as i could go it is marvel i was not drowned for when i was brought stand at last my legs shook under me my mouth was so dry i must wet it with sea water before i was able shout all this time boat was coming on now i was able perceive it was same boat same two men as yesterday this i knew by their hair which one had bright yellow other black but now there was third man along with them who looked be better class as soon as they were come within easy speech they let down their sail lay quiet spite my supplications they drew no nearer what frightened me most all new man tee hee d with laughter as he talked looked at me then he stood up boat addressed me long while speaking fast with many wavings his hand i told him i had no gaelic at this he became very angry i began suspect he thought he was talking english listening very close i caught word whateffer several times but all rest was gaelic might have been greek hebrew for me whatever said i show him i had caught word yes yes yes yes says he then he looked at other men as much as say i told you i spoke english began again as hard as ever gaelic this time i picked out another word tide then i had flash hope i remembered he was always waving his hand towards mainland ross do you mean when tide is out i cried could not finish yes yes said he tide at that i turned tail upon their boat where my adviser had once more begun tee hee with laughter leaped back way i had come from one stone another set off running across isle as i had never run before about half hour i came out upon shores creek sure enough it was shrunk into little trickle water through which i dashed not above my knees landed with shout on main island sea bred boy would not have stayed day on earraid which is only what they call tidal islet except bottom neaps can be entered left twice every twenty four hours either dry shod or at most by wading even i who had tide going out before me bay even watched for ebbs better get my shellfish even i i say if i had sat down think instead raging at my fate must have soon guessed secret got free it was no wonder fishers had not understood me wonder was rather that they had ever guessed my pitiful illusion taken trouble come back i had starved with cold hunger on that island for close upon one hundred hours but for fishers i might have left my bones there pure folly even as it was i had paid for it pretty dear not only past sufferings but my present case being clothed like beggar man scarce able walk great pain my sore throat i have seen wicked men fools great many both i believe they both get paid end but fools first chapter xv lad with silver button through isle mull ross mull which i had now got upon was rugged trackless like isle i had just left being all bog brier big stone there may be roads for them that know that country well but for my part i had no better guide than my own nose no other landmark than ben more i aimed as well as i could for smoke i had seen so often from island with all my great weariness difficulty way came upon house bottom little hollow about five or six at night it was low longish roofed with turf built unmortared stones on mound front it old gentleman sat smoking his pipe sun with what little english he had he gave me understand that my shipmates had got safe ashore had broken bread that very house on day after was there one i asked dressed like gentleman he said they all wore rough great coats but be sure first them one that came alone wore breeches stockings while rest had sailors trousers ah said i he would have feathered hat he told me no that he was bareheaded like myself at first i thought alan might have lost his hat then rain came my mind i judged it more likely he had it out harm s way under his great coat this set me smiling partly because my friend was safe partly think his vanity dress then old gentleman clapped his hand his brow cried out that i must be lad with silver button why yes said i some wonder well then said old gentleman i have word for you that you are follow your friend his country by torosay he then asked me how i had fared i told him my tale south country man would certainly have laughed but this old gentleman i call him so because his manners for his clothes were dropping off his back heard me all through with nothing but gravity pity when i had done he took me by hand led me into his hut it was no better presented me before his wife as if she had been queen i duke good woman set oat bread before me cold grouse patting my shoulder smiling me all time for she had no english old gentleman not be behind brewed me strong punch out their country spirit all while i was eating after that when i was drinking punch i could scarce come believe my good fortune house though it was thick with peat smoke as full holes as colander seemed like palace punch threw me strong sweat deep slumber good people let me lie it was near noon next day before i took road my throat already easier my spirits quite restored by good fare good news old gentleman although i pressed him hard would take no money gave me old bonnet for my head though i am free own i was no sooner out view house than i very jealously washed this gift his wayside fountain thought i myself if these are wild highlanders i could wish my own folk wilder i not only started late but i must have wandered nearly half time true i met plenty people grubbing little miserable fields that would not keep cat or herding little kine about bigness asses highland dress being forbidden by law since rebellion people condemned lowland habit which they much disliked it was strange see variety their array some went bare only for hanging cloak or great coat carried their trousers on their backs like useless burthen some had made imitation tartan with little parti coloured stripes patched together like old wife s quilt others again still wore highland philabeg but by putting few stitches between legs transformed it into pair trousers like dutchman s all those makeshifts were condemned punished for law was harshly applied hopes break up clan spirit but that out way sea bound isle there were few make remarks fewer tell tales they seemed great poverty which was no doubt natural now that rapine was put down chiefs kept no longer open house roads even such wandering country by track as one i followed were infested with beggars here again i marked difference from my own part country for our lowland beggars even gownsmen themselves who beg by patent had louting flattering way with them if you gave them plaek asked change would very civilly return you boddle but these highland beggars stood on their dignity asked alms only buy snuff by their account would give no change be sure this was no concern mine except so far as it entertained me by way what was much more purpose few had any english these few unless they were brotherhood beggars not very anxious place it at my service i knew torosay be my destination repeated name them pointed but instead simply pointing reply they would give me screed gaelic that set me foolish so it was small wonder if i went out my road as often as i stayed it at last about eight at night already very weary i came lone house where i asked admittance was refused until i bethought me power money so poor country held up one my guineas my finger thumb thereupon man house who had hitherto pretended have no english driven me from his door by signals suddenly began speak as clearly as was needful agreed for five shillings give me night s lodging guide me next day torosay i slept uneasily that night fearing i should be robbed but i might have spared myself pain for my host was no robber only miserably poor great cheat he was not alone his poverty for next morning we must go five miles about house what he called rich man have one my guineas changed this was perhaps rich man for mull he would have scarce been thought so south for it took all he had whole house was turned upside down neighbour brought under contribution before he could scrape together twenty shillings silver odd shilling he kept for himself protesting he could ill afford have so great sum money lying locked up for all that he was very courteous well spoken made us both sit down with his family dinner brewed punch fine china bowl over which my rascal guide grew so merry that he refused start i was for getting angry appealed rich man hector maclean was his name who had been witness our bargain my payment five shillings but maclean had taken his share punch vowed that no gentleman should leave his table after bowl was brewed so there was nothing for it but sit hear jacobite toasts gaelic songs till all were tipsy staggered off bed or barn for their night s rest next day fourth my travels we were up before five upon clock but my rascal guide got bottle at once it was three hours before i had him clear house then as you shall hear only for worse disappointment as long as we went down heathery valley that lay before mr maclean s house all went well only my guide looked constantly over his shoulder when i asked him cause only grinned at me no sooner however had we crossed back hill got out sight house windows than he told me torosay lay right front that hill top which he pointed out was my best landmark i care very little for that said i since you are going with me impudent cheat answered me gaelic that he had no english my fine fellow i said i know very well your english comes goes tell me what will bring it back is it more money you wish five shillings mair said he hersel will bring ye there i reflected awhile then offered him two which he accepted greedily insisted on having his hands at once for luck as he said but i think it was rather for my misfortune two shillings carried him not quite as many miles at end which distance he sat down upon wayside took off his brogues from his feet like man about rest i was now red hot ha said i have you no more english he said impudently no at that i boiled over lifted my hand strike him he drawing knife from his rags squatted back grinned at me like wildcat at that forgetting everything but my anger i ran upon him put aside his knife with my left struck him mouth with right i was strong lad very angry he but little man he went down before me heavily by good luck his knife flew out his hand as he fell i picked up both that his brogues wished him good morning set off upon my way leaving him barefoot disarmed i chuckled myself as i went being sure i was done with that rogue for variety reasons first he knew he could have no more my money next brogues were worth that country only few pence lastly knife which was really dagger it was against law for him carry about half hour walk i overtook great ragged man moving pretty fast but feeling before him with staff he was quite blind told me he was catechist which should have put me at my ease but his face went against me it seemed dark dangerous secret presently as we began go on alongside i saw steel butt pistol sticking from under flap his coat pocket carry such thing meant fine fifteen pounds sterling upon first offence transportation colonies upon second nor could i quite see why religious teacher should go armed or what blind man could be doing with pistol i told him about my guide for i was proud what i had done my vanity for once got heels my prudence at mention five shillings he cried out so loud that i made up my mind i should say nothing other two was glad he could not see my blushes was it too much i asked little faltering too much cries he why i will guide you torosay myself for dram brandy give you great pleasure my company me that is man some learning bargain i said i did not see how blind man could be guide but at that he laughed aloud said his stick was eyes enough for eagle isle mull at least says he where i know every stone heather bush by mark head see now he said striking right left as if make sure down there burn is running at head it there stands bit small hill with stone cocked upon top that it s hard at foot hill that way runs by torosay way here being for droves is plainly trodden will show grassy through heather i had own he was right every feature told my wonder ha says he that s nothing would ye believe me now that before act came out when there were weepons this country i could shoot ay could i cries he then with leer if ye had such thing as pistol here try with i would show ye how it s done i told him i had nothing sort gave him wider berth if he had known his pistol stuck at that time quite plainly out his pocket i could see sun twinkle on steel butt but by better luck for me he knew nothing thought all was covered lied on dark he then began question me cunningly where i came from whether i was rich whether i could change five shilling piece for him which he declared he had that moment his sporran all time he kept edging up me i avoiding him we were now upon sort green cattle track which crossed hills towards torosay we kept changing sides upon that like dancers reel i had so plainly upper hand that my spirits rose indeed i took pleasure this game blindman s buff but catechist grew angrier angrier at last began swear gaelic strike for my legs with his staff then i told him that sure enough i had pistol my pocket as well as he if he did not strike across hill due south i would even blow his brains out he became at once very polite after trying soften me for some time but quite vain he cursed me once more gaelic took himself off i watched him striding along through bog brier tapping with his stick until he turned end hill disappeared next hollow then i struck on again for torosay much better pleased be alone than travel with that man learning this was unlucky day these two whom i had just rid myself one after other were two worst men i met with highlands at torosay on sound mull looking over mainland morven there was inn with innkeeper who was maclean it appeared very high family for keep inn is thought even more genteel highlands than it is with us perhaps as partaking hospitality or perhaps because trade is idle drunken he spoke good english finding me be something scholar tried me first french where he easily beat me then latin which i don t know which us did best this pleasant rivalry put us at once upon friendly terms i sat up drank punch with him or be more correct sat up watched him drink it until he was so tipsy that he wept upon my shoulder i tried him as if by accident with sight alan s button but it was plain he had never seen or heard it indeed he bore some grudge against family friends ardshiel before he was drunk he read me lampoon very good latin but with very ill meaning which he had made elegiac verses upon person that house when i told him my catechist he shook his head said i was lucky have got clear off that is very dangerous man he said duncan mackiegh is his name he can shoot by ear at several yards has been often accused highway robberies once murder cream it is says i that he called himself catechist why should he not says he when that is what he is it was maclean duart gave it him because he was blind but perhaps it was peety says my host for he is always on road going from one place another hear young folk say their religion doubtless that is great temptation poor man at last when my landlord could drink no more he showed me bed i lay down very good spirits having travelled greater part that big crooked island mull from earraid torosay fifty miles as crow flies with my wanderings much nearer hundred four days with little fatigue indeed i was by far better heart health body at end that long tramp than i had been at beginning chapter xvi lad with silver button across morven there is regular ferry from torosay kinlochaline on mainland both shores sound are country strong clan macleans people that passed ferry with me were almost all that clan skipper boat on other hand was called neil roy macrob since macrob was one names alan s clansmen alan himself had sent me that ferry i was eager come private speech neil roy crowded boat this was course impossible passage was very slow affair there was no wind as boat was wretchedly equipped we could pull but two oars on one side one on other men gave way however with good will passengers taking spells help them whole company giving time gaelic boat songs what with songs sea air good nature spirit all concerned bright weather passage was pretty thing have seen but there was one melancholy part mouth loch aline we found great sea going ship at anchor this i supposed at first be one king s cruisers which were kept along that coast both summer winter prevent communication with french as we got little nearer it became plain she was ship merchandise what still more puzzled me not only her decks but sea beach also were quite black with people skiffs were continually plying fro between them yet nearer there began come our ears great sound mourning people on board those on shore crying lamenting one another so as pierce heart then i understood this was emigrant ship bound for american colonies we put ferry boat alongside exiles leaned over bulwarks weeping reaching out their hands my fellow passengers among whom they counted some near friends how long this might have gone on i do not know for they seemed have no sense time but at last captain ship who seemed near beside himself no great wonder midst this crying confusion came side begged us depart thereupon neil sheered off chief singer our boat struck into melancholy air which was presently taken up both by emigrants their friends upon beach so that it sounded from all sides like lament for dying i saw tears run down cheeks men women boat even as they bent at oars circumstances music song which is one called lochaber no more were highly affecting even myself at kinlochaline i got neil roy upon one side on beach said i made sure he was one appin s men what for no said he i am seeking somebody said i it comes my mind that you will have news him alan breck stewart is his name very foolishly instead showing him button i sought pass shilling his hand at this he drew back i am very much affronted he said this is not way that one shentleman should behave another at all man you ask for is france but if he was my sporran says he your belly full shillings i would not hurt hair upon his body i saw i had gone wrong way work without wasting time upon apologies showed him button lying hollow my palm aweel aweel said neil i think ye might have begun with that end stick whatever but if ye are lad with silver button all is well i have word see that ye come safe but if ye will pardon me speak plainly says he there is name that you should never take into your mouth that is name alan breck there is thing that ye would never do that is offer your dirty money hieland shentleman it was not very easy apologise for i could scarce tell him what was truth that i had never dreamed he would set up be gentleman until he told me so neil on his part had no wish prolong his dealings with me only fulfil his orders be done with it he made haste give me my route this was lie night kinlochaline public inn cross morven next day ardgour lie night house one john claymore who was warned that i might come third day be set across one loch at corran another at balachulish then ask my way house james glens at aucharn duror appin there was good deal ferrying as you hear sea all this part running deep into mountains winding about their roots it makes country strong hold difficult travel but full prodigious wild dreadful prospects i had some other advice from neil speak with no one by way avoid whigs campbells red soldiers leave road lie bush if i saw any latter coming for it was never chancy meet with them brief conduct myself like robber or jacobite agent as perhaps neil thought me inn at kinlochaline was most beggarly vile place that ever pigs were styed full smoke vermin silent highlanders i was not only discontented with my lodging but with myself for my mismanagement neil thought i could hardly be worse off but very wrongly as i was soon see for i had not been half hour at inn standing door most time ease my eyes from peat smoke when thunderstorm came close by springs broke little hill on which inn stood one end house became running water places public entertainment were bad enough all over scotland those days yet it was wonder myself when i had go from fireside bed which i slept wading over shoes early my next day s journey i overtook little stout solemn man walking very slowly with his toes turned out sometimes reading book sometimes marking place with his finger dressed decently plainly something clerical style this i found be another catechist but different order from blind man mull being indeed one those sent out by edinburgh society for propagating christian knowledge evangelise more savage places highlands his name was henderland he spoke with broad south country tongue which i was beginning weary for sound besides common countryship we soon found we had more particular bond interest for my good friend minister essendean had translated into gaelic his by time number hymns pious books which henderland used his work held great esteem indeed it was one these he was carrying reading when we met we fell company at once our ways lying together as far as kingairloch as we went he stopped spoke with all wayfarers workers that we met or passed though course i could not tell what they discoursed about yet i judged mr henderland must be well liked countryside for i observed many them bring out their mulls share pinch snuff with him i told him as far my affairs as i judged wise as far that is as they were none alan s gave balachulish as place i was travelling meet friend for i thought aucharn or even duror would be too particular might put him on scent on his part he told me much his work people he worked among hiding priests jacobites disarming act dress many other curiosities time place he seemed moderate blaming parliament several points especially because they had framed act more severely against those who wore dress than against those who carried weapons this moderation put it my mind question him red fox appin tenants questions which i thought would seem natural enough mouth one travelling that country he said it was bad business it s wonderful said he where tenants find money for their life is mere starvation ye don t carry such thing as snuff do ye mr balfour no well i m better wanting it but these tenants as i was saying are doubtless partly driven it james stewart duror that s him they call james glens is half brother ardshiel captain clan he is man much looked up drives very hard then there s one they call alan breck ah i cried what him what wind that bloweth where it listeth said henderland he s here awa here day gone morrow fair heather cat he might be glowering at two us out yon whin bush i wouldnae wonder ye ll no carry such thing as snuff will ye i told him no that he had asked same thing more than once it s highly possible said he sighing but it seems strange ye shouldnae carry it however as i was saying this alan breck is bold desperate customer well kent be james s right hand his life is forfeit already he would boggle at naething maybe if tenant body was hang back he would get dirk his wame you make poor story it all mr henderland said i if it is all fear upon both sides i care hear no more it na said mr henderland but there s love too self denial that should put like you me shame there s something fine about it no perhaps christian but humanly fine even alan breck by all that i hear is chield be respected there s many lying sneck draw sits close kirk our own part country stands well world s eye maybe is far worse man mr balfour than yon misguided shedder man s blood ay ay we might take lesson by them ye ll perhaps think i ve been too long hielands he added smiling me i told him not at all that i had seen much admire among highlanders if he came that mr campbell himself was highlander ay said he that s true it s fine blood what is king s agent about i asked colin campbell says henderland putting his head bees byke he is turn tenants out by force i hear said i yes says he but business has gone back forth as folk say first james glens rode edinburgh got some lawyer stewart nae doubt they all hing together like bats steeple had proceedings stayed then colin campbell cam again had upper hand before barons exchequer now they tell me first tenants are flit morrow it s begin at duror under james s very windows which doesnae seem wise by my humble way it do you think they ll fight i asked well says henderland they re disarmed or supposed be for there s still good deal cold iron lying by quiet places then colin campbell has sogers coming but for all that if i was his lady wife i wouldnae be well pleased till i got him home again they re queer customers appin stewarts i asked if they were worse than their neighbours no they said he that s worst part it for if colin roy can get his business done appin he has it all begin again next country which they call mamore which is one countries camerons he s king s factor upon both from both he has drive out tenants indeed mr balfour be open with ye it s my belief that if he escapes one lot he ll get his death by other so we continued talking walking great part day until at last mr henderland after expressing his delight my company satisfaction at meeting with friend mr campbell s whom says he i will make bold call that sweet singer our covenanted zion proposed that i should make short stage lie night his house little beyond kingairloch say truth i was overjoyed for i had no great desire for john claymore since my double misadventure first with guide next with gentleman skipper i stood some fear any highland stranger accordingly we shook hands upon bargain came afternoon small house standing alone by shore linnhe loch sun was already gone from desert mountains ardgour upon hither side but shone on those appin on farther loch lay as still as lake only gulls were crying round sides it whole place seemed solemn uncouth we had no sooner come door mr henderland s dwelling than my great surprise for i was now used politeness highlanders he burst rudely past me dashed into room caught up jar small horn spoon began ladling snuff into his nose most excessive quantities then he had hearty fit sneezing looked round upon me with rather silly smile it s vow i took says he i took vow upon me that i wouldnae carry it doubtless it s great privation but when i think upon martyrs not only scottish covenant but other points christianity i think shame mind it as soon as we had eaten porridge whey was best good man s diet he took grave face said he had duty perform by mr campbell that was inquire into my state mind towards god i was inclined smile at him since business snuff but he had not spoken long before he brought tears into my eyes there are two things that men should never weary goodness humility we get none too much them this rough world among cold proud people but mr henderland had their very speech upon his tongue though i was good deal puffed up with my adventures with having come off as saying is with flying colours yet he soon had me on my knees beside simple poor old man both proud glad be there before we went bed he offered me sixpence help me on my way out scanty store he kept turf wall his house at which excess goodness i knew not what do but at last he was so earnest with me that i thought it more mannerly part let him have his way so left him poorer than myself chapter xvii death red fox next day mr henderland found for me man who had boat his own was cross linnhe loch that afternoon into appin fishing him he prevailed on take me for he was one his flock this way i saved long day s travel price two public ferries i must otherwise have passed it was near noon before we set out dark day with clouds sun shining upon little patches sea was here very deep still had scarce wave upon it so that i must put water my lips before i could believe it be truly salt mountains on either side were high rough barren very black gloomy shadow clouds but all silver laced with little watercourses where sun shone upon them it seemed hard country this appin for people care as much about as alan did there was but one thing mention little after we had started sun shone upon little moving clump scarlet close along water side north it was much same red as soldiers coats every now then too there came little sparks lightnings as though sun had struck upon bright steel i asked my boatman what it should be he answered he supposed it was some red soldiers coming from fort william into appin against poor tenantry country well it was sad sight me whether it was because my thoughts alan or from something prophetic my bosom although this was but second time i had seen king george s troops i had no good will them at last we came so near point land at entering loch leven that i begged be set on shore my boatman who was honest fellow mindful his promise catechist would fain have carried me on balachulish but as this was take me farther from my secret destination i insisted was set on shore at last under wood lettermore or lettervore for i have heard it both ways alan s country appin this was wood birches growing on steep craggy side mountain that overhung loch it had many openings ferny howes road or bridle track ran north south through midst it by edge which where was spring i sat down eat some oat bread mr henderland s think upon my situation here i was not only troubled by cloud stinging midges but far more by doubts my mind what i ought do why i was going join myself with outlaw would be murderer like alan whether i should not be acting more like man sense tramp back south country direct by my own guidance at my own charges what mr campbell or even mr henderland would think me if they should ever learn my folly presumption these were doubts that now began come on me stronger than ever as i was so sitting thinking sound men horses came me through wood presently after at turning road i saw four travellers come into view way was this part so rough narrow that they came single led their horses by reins first was great red headed gentleman imperious flushed face who carried his hat his hand fanned himself for he was breathing heat second by his decent black garb white wig i correctly took be lawyer third was servant wore some part his clothes tartan which showed that his master was highland family either outlaw or else singular good odour with government since wearing tartan was against act if i had been better versed these things i would have known tartan be argyle or campbell colours this servant had good sized portmanteau strapped on his horse net lemons brew punch with hanging at saddle bow as was often enough custom with luxurious travellers that part country as for fourth who brought up tail i had seen his like before knew him at once be sheriff s officer i had no sooner seen these people coming than i made up my mind for no reason that i can tell go through with my adventure when first came alongside me i rose up from bracken asked him way aucharn he stopped looked at me as i thought little oddly then turning lawyer mungo said he there s many man would think this more warning than two pyats here am i on my road duror on job ye ken here is young lad starts up out bracken speers if i am on way aucharn glenure said other this is ill subject for jesting these two had now drawn close up were gazing at me while two followers had halted about stone cast rear what seek ye aucharn said colin roy campbell glenure him they called red fox for he it was that i had stopped man that lives there said i james glens says glenure musingly then lawyer is he gathering his people think ye anyway says lawyer we shall do better bide where we are let soldiers rally us if you are concerned for me said i i am neither his people nor yours but honest subject king george owing no man fearing no man why very well said replies factor but if i may make so bold as ask what does this honest man so far from his country why does he come seeking brother ardshiel i have power here i must tell you i am king s factor upon several these estates have twelve files soldiers at my back i have heard waif word country said i little nettled that you were hard man drive he still kept looking at me as if doubt well said he at last your tongue is bold but i am no unfriend plainness if ye had asked me way door james stewart on any other day but this i would have set ye right bidden ye god speed but day eh mungo he turned again look at lawyer but just as he turned there came shot firelock from higher up hill with very sound it glenure fell upon road o i am dead he cried several times over lawyer had caught him up held him his arms servant standing over clasping his hands now wounded man looked from one another with scared eyes there was change his voice that went heart take care yourselves says he i am dead he tried open his clothes as if look for wound but his fingers slipped on buttons with that he gave great sigh his head rolled on his shoulder he passed away lawyer said never word but his face was as sharp as pen as white as dead man s servant broke out into great noise crying weeping like child i on my side stood staring at them kind horror sheriff s officer had run back at first sound shot hasten coming soldiers at last lawyer laid down dead man his blood upon road got his own feet with kind stagger i believe it was his movement that brought me my senses for he had no sooner done so than i began scramble up hill crying out murderer murderer so little time had elapsed that when i got top first steepness could see some part open mountain murderer was still moving away at no great distance he was big man black coat with metal buttons carried long fowling piece here i cried i see him at that murderer gave little quick look over his shoulder began run next moment he was lost fringe birches then he came out again on upper side where i could see him climbing like jackanapes for that part was again very steep then he dipped behind shoulder i saw him no more all this time i had been running on my side had got good way up when voice cried upon me stand i was at edge upper wood so now when i halted looked back i saw all open part hill below me lawyer sheriff s officer were standing just above road crying waving on me come back on their left red coats musket hand were beginning struggle singly out lower wood why should i come back i cried come you on ten pounds if ye take that lad cried lawyer he s accomplice he was posted here hold us talk at that word which i could hear quite plainly though it was soldiers not me that he was crying it my heart came my mouth with quite new kind terror indeed it is one thing stand danger your life quite another run peril both life character thing besides had come so suddenly like thunder out clear sky that i was all amazed helpless soldiers began spread some them run others put up their pieces cover me still i stood jouk 18 here among trees said voice close by 18 duck indeed i scarce knew what i was doing but i obeyed as i did so i heard firelocks bang balls whistle birches just inside shelter trees i found alan breck standing with fishing rod he gave me no salutation indeed it was no time for civilities only come says he set off running along side mountain towards balachulish i like sheep follow him now we ran among birches now stooping behind low humps upon mountain side now crawling on all fours among heather pace was deadly my heart seemed bursting against my ribs i had neither time think nor breath speak with only i remember seeing with wonder that alan every now then would straighten himself his full height look back every time he did so there came great far away cheering crying soldiers quarter hour later alan stopped clapped down flat heather turned me now said he it s earnest do as i do for your life at same speed but now with infinitely more precaution we traced back again across mountain side by same way that we had come only perhaps higher till at last alan threw himself down upper wood lettermore where i had found him at first lay with his face bracken panting like dog my own sides so ached my head so swam my tongue so hung out my mouth with heat dryness that i lay beside him like one dead chapter xviii i talk with alan wood lettermore alan was first come round he rose went border wood peered out little then returned sat down well said he yon was hot burst david i said nothing nor so much as lifted my face i had seen murder done great ruddy jovial gentleman struck out life moment pity that sight was still sore within me yet that was but part my concern here was murder done upon man alan hated here was alan skulking trees running from troops whether his was hand that fired or only head that ordered signified but little by my way it my only friend that wild country was blood guilty first degree i held him horror i could not look upon his face i would have rather lain alone rain on my cold isle than that warm wood beside murderer are ye still wearied he asked again no said i still with my face bracken no i am not wearied now i can speak you me must twine 19 i said i liked you very well alan but your ways are not mine they re not god s short long it is just that we must twine 19 part i will hardly twine from ye david without some kind reason for same said alan mighty gravely if ye ken anything against my reputation it s least thing that ye should do for old acquaintance sake let me hear name it if ye have only taken distaste my society it will be proper for me judge if i m insulted alan said i what is sense this ye ken very well yon campbell man lies his blood upon road he was silent for little then says he did ever ye hear tell story man good people by which he meant fairies no said i nor do i want hear it with your permission mr balfour i will tell it you whatever says alan man ye should ken was cast upon rock sea where it appears good people were use come rest as they went through ireland name this rock is called skerryvore it s not far from where we suffered ship wreck well it seems man cried so sore if he could just see his little bairn before he died that at last king good people took peety upon him sent one flying that brought back bairn poke 20 laid it down beside man where he lay sleeping so when man woke there was poke beside him something into inside it that moved well it seems he was one these gentry that think aye worst things for greater security he stuck his dirk throughout that poke before he opened it there was his bairn dead i am thinking myself mr balfour that you man are very much alike 20 bag do you mean you had no hand it cried i sitting up i will tell you first all mr balfour shaws as one friend another said alan that if i were going kill gentleman it would not be my own country bring trouble on my clan i would not go wanting sword gun with long fishing rod upon my back well said i that s true now continued alan taking out his dirk laying his hand upon it certain manner i swear upon holy iron i had neither art nor part act nor thought it i thank god for that cried i offered him my hand he did not appear see it here is great deal work about campbell said he they are not so scarce that i ken at least said i you cannot justly blame me for you know very well what you told me brig but temptation act are different i thank god again for that we may all be tempted but take life cold blood alan i could say no more for moment do you know who did it i added do you know that man black coat i have nae clear mind about his coat said alan cunningly but it sticks my head that it was blue blue or black did ye know him said i i couldnae just conscientiously swear him says alan he gaed very close by me be sure but it s strange thing that i should just have been tying my brogues can you swear that you don t know him alan i cried half angered half mind laugh at his evasions not yet says he but i ve grand memory for forgetting david yet there was one thing i saw clearly said i that was that you exposed yourself me draw soldiers it s very likely said alan so would any gentleman you me were innocent that transaction better reason since we were falsely suspected that we should get clear i cried innocent should surely come before guilty why david said he innocent have aye chance get assoiled court but for lad that shot bullet i think best place for him will be heather them that havenae dipped their hands any little difficulty should be very mindful case them that have that is good christianity for if it was other way round about lad whom i couldnae just clearly see had been our shoes we his as might very well have been i think we would be good deal obliged him oursel s if he would draw soldiers when it came this i gave alan up but he looked so innocent all time was such clear good faith what he said so ready sacrifice himself for what he deemed his duty that my mouth was closed mr henderland s words came back me that we ourselves might take lesson by these wild highlanders well here i had taken mine alan s morals were all tail first but he was ready give his life for them such as they were alan said i i ll not say it s good christianity as i understand it but it s good enough here i offer ye my hand for second time whereupon he gave me both his saying surely i had cast spell upon him for he could forgive me anything then he grew very grave said we had not much time throw away but must both flee that country he because he was deserter whole appin would now be searched like chamber every one obliged give good account himself i because i was certainly involved murder o says i willing give him little lesson i have no fear justice my country as if this was your country said he or as if ye would be tried here country stewarts it s all scotland said i man i whiles wonder at ye said alan this is campbell that s been killed well it ll be tried inverara campbells head place with fifteen campbells jury box biggest campbell all that s duke sitting cocking on bench justice david same justice by all world as glenure found awhile ago at roadside this frightened me little i confess would have frightened me more if i had known how nearly exact were alan s predictions indeed it was but one point that he exaggerated there being but eleven campbells on jury though as other four were equally duke s dependence it mattered less than might appear still i cried out that he was unjust duke argyle who for all he was whig was yet wise honest nobleman hoot said alan man s whig nae doubt but i would never deny he was good chieftain his clan what would clan think if there was campbell shot naebody hanged their own chief justice general but i have often observed says alan that you low country bodies have no clear idea what s right wrong at this i did at last laugh out aloud when my surprise alan joined laughed as merrily as myself na na said he we re hielands david when i tell ye run take my word run nae doubt it s hard thing skulk starve heather but it s harder yet lie shackled red coat prison i asked him whither we should flee as he told me lowlands i was little better inclined go with him for indeed i was growing impatient get back have upper hand my uncle besides alan made so sure there would be no question justice matter that i began be afraid he might be right all deaths i would truly like least die by gallows picture that uncanny instrument came into my head with extraordinary clearness as i had once seen it engraved at top pedlar s ballad took away my appetite for courts justice i ll chance it alan said i i ll go with you but mind you said alan it s no small thing ye maun lie bare hard brook many empty belly your bed shall be moorcock s your life shall be like hunted deer s ye shall sleep with your hand upon your weapons ay man ye shall taigle many weary foot or we get clear i tell ye this at start for it s life that i ken well but if ye ask what other chance ye have i answer nane either take heather with me or else hang that s choice very easily made said i we shook hands upon it now let s take another keek at red coats says alan he led me north eastern fringe wood looking out between trees we could see great side mountain running down exceeding steep into waters loch it was rough part all hanging stone heather big scrogs birchwood away at far end towards balachulish little wee red soldiers were dipping up down over hill howe growing smaller every minute there was no cheering now for i think they had other uses for what breath was left them but they still stuck trail doubtless thought that we were close front them alan watched them smiling himself ay said he they ll be gey weary before they ve got end that employ so you me david can sit down eat bite breathe bit longer take dram from my bottle then we ll strike for aucharn house my kinsman james glens where i must get my clothes my arms money carry us along then david we ll cry forth fortune take cast among heather so we sat again ate drank place whence we could see sun going down into field great wild houseless mountains such as i was now condemned wander with my companion partly as we so sat partly afterwards on way aucharn each us narrated his adventures i shall here set down so much alan s as seems either curious or needful it appears he ran bulwarks as soon as wave was passed saw me lost me saw me again as i tumbled roost at last had one glimpse me clinging on yard it was this that put him some hope i would maybe get land after all made him leave those clues messages which had brought me for my sins that unlucky country appin meanwhile those still on brig had got skiff launched one or two were on board her already when there came second wave greater than first heaved brig out her place would certainly have sent her bottom had she not struck caught on some projection reef when she had struck first it had been bows on so that stern had hitherto been lowest but now her stern was thrown air bows plunged under sea with that water began pour into fore scuttle like pouring mill dam it took colour out alan s face even tell what followed for there were still two men lying impotent their bunks these seeing water pour thinking ship had foundered began cry out aloud that with such harrowing cries that all who were on deck tumbled one after another into skiff fell their oars they were not two hundred yards away when there came third great sea at that brig lifted clean over reef her canvas filled for moment she seemed sail chase them but settling all while presently she drew down down as if hand was drawing her sea closed over covenant dysart never word they spoke as they pulled ashore being stunned with horror that screaming but they had scarce set foot upon beach when hoseason woke up as if out muse bade them lay hands upon alan they hung back indeed having little taste for employment but hoseason was like fiend crying that alan was alone that he had great sum about him that he had been means losing brig drowning all their comrades that here was both revenge wealth upon single cast it was seven against one that part shore there was no rock that alan could set his back sailors began spread out come behind him then said alan little man with red head i havenae mind name that he is called riach said i ay said alan riach well it was him that took up clubs for me asked men if they werenae feared judgment says he dod i ll put my back hielandman s mysel that s none such entirely bad little man yon little man with red head said alan he has some spunks decency well said i he was kind me his way so he was alan said he by my troth i found his way very good one but ye see david loss ship cries these poor lads sat very ill upon man i m thinking that would be cause it well i would think so says i for he was as keen as any rest at beginning but how did hoseason take it it sticks my mind that he would take it very ill says alan but little man cried me run indeed i thought it was good observe ran last that i saw they were all knot upon beach like folk that were not agreeing very well together what do you mean by that said i well fists were going said alan i saw one man go down like pair breeks but i thought it would be better no wait ye see there s strip campbells that end mull which is no good company for gentleman like me if it hadnae been for that i would have waited looked for ye mysel let alone giving hand little man it was droll how alan dwelt on mr riach s stature for say truth one was not much smaller than other so says he continuing i set my best foot forward whenever i met with any one i cried out there was wreck ashore man they didnae stop fash with me ye should have seen them linking for beach when they got there they found they had had pleasure run which is aye good for campbell i m thinking it was judgment on clan that brig went down lump didnae break but it was very unlucky thing for you that same for if any wreck had come ashore they would have hunted high low would soon have found ye chapter xix house fear night fell as we were walking clouds which had broken up afternoon settled thickened so that it fell for season year extremely dark way we went was over rough mountainsides though alan pushed on with assured manner i could by no means see how he directed himself at last about half past ten clock we came top brae saw lights below us it seemed house door stood open let out beam fire candle light all round house steading five or six persons were moving hurriedly about each carrying lighted brand james must have tint his wits said alan if this was soldiers instead you me he would be bonny mess but i dare say he ll have sentry on road he would ken well enough no soldiers would find way that we came hereupon he whistled three times particular manner it was strange see how at first sound it all moving torches came stand as if bearers were affrighted how at third bustle began again as before having thus set folks minds at rest we came down brae were met at yard gate for this place was like well doing farm by tall handsome man more than fifty who cried out alan gaelic james stewart said alan i will ask ye speak scotch for here is young gentleman with me that has nane other this is him he added putting his arm through mine young gentleman lowlands laird his country too but i am thinking it will be better for his health if we give his name go by james glens turned me for moment greeted me courteously enough next he had turned alan this has been dreadful accident he cried it will bring trouble on country he wrung his hands hoots said alan ye must take sour with sweet man colin roy is dead be thankful for that ay said james by my troth i wish he was alive again it s all very fine blow boast beforehand but now it s done alan who s bear wyte 21 it accident fell out appin mind ye that alan it s appin that must pay i am man that has family 21 blame while this was going on i looked about me at servants some were on ladders digging thatch house or farm buildings from which they brought out guns swords different weapons war others carried them away by sound mattock blows from somewhere farther down brae i suppose they buried them though they were all so busy there prevailed no kind order their efforts men struggled together for same gun ran into each other with their burning torches james was continually turning about from his talk with alan cry out orders which were apparently never understood faces torchlight were like those people overborne with hurry panic though none spoke above his breath their speech sounded both anxious angry it was about this time that lassie came out house carrying pack or bundle it has often made me smile think how alan s instinct awoke at mere sight it what s that lassie has he asked we re just setting house order alan said james his frightened somewhat fawning way they ll search appin with candles we must have all things straight we re digging bit guns swords into moss ye see these i am thinking will be your ain french clothes we ll be bury them i believe bury my french clothes cried alan troth no he laid hold upon packet retired into barn shift himself recommending me meanwhile his kinsman james carried me accordingly into kitchen sat down with me at table smiling talking at first very hospitable manner but presently gloom returned upon him he sat frowning biting his fingers only remembered me from time time then gave me but word or two poor smile back into his private terrors his wife sat by fire wept with her face her hands his eldest son was crouched upon floor running over great mass papers now again setting one alight burning it bitter end all while servant lass with red face was rummaging about room blind hurry fear whimpering as she went every now again one men would thrust his face from yard cry for orders at last james could keep his seat no longer begged my permission be so unmannerly as walk about i am but poor company altogether sir says he but i can think nothing but this dreadful accident trouble it is like bring upon quite innocent persons little after he observed his son burning paper which he thought should have been kept at that his excitement burst out so that it was painful witness he struck lad repeatedly are you gone gyte 22 he cried do you wish hang your father forgetful my presence carried on at him long time together gaelic young man answering nothing only wife at name hanging throwing her apron over her face sobbing out louder than before 22 mad this was all wretched for stranger like myself hear see i was right glad when alan returned looking like himself his fine french clothes though be sure they were now grown almost too battered withered deserve name fine i was then taken out my turn by another sons given that change clothing which i had stood so long need pair highland brogues made deer leather rather strange at first but after little practice very easy feet by time i came back alan must have told his story for it seemed understood that i was fly with him they were all busy upon our equipment they gave us each sword pistols though i professed my inability use former with these some ammunition bag oatmeal iron pan bottle right french brandy we were ready for heather money indeed was lacking i had about two guineas left alan s belt having been despatched by another hand that trusty messenger had no more than seventeen pence his whole fortune as for james it appears he had brought himself so low with journeys edinburgh legal expenses on behalf tenants that he could only scrape together three five pence halfpenny most it coppers this ll no do said alan ye must find safe bit somewhere near by said james get word sent me ye see ye ll have get this business prettily off alan this is no time be stayed for guinea or two they re sure get wind ye sure seek ye by my way it sure lay on ye wyte this day s accident if it falls on you it falls on me that am your near kinsman harboured ye while ye were country if it comes on me he paused bit his fingers with white face it would be painful thing for our friends if i was hang said he it would be ill day for appin says alan it s day that sticks my throat said james o man man man man alan you me have spoken like two fools he cried striking his hand upon wall so that house rang again well that s true too said alan my friend from lowlands here nodding at me gave me good word upon that head if i would only have listened him but see here said james returning his former manner if they lay me by heels alan it s then that you ll be needing money for with all that i have said that you have said it will look very black against two us do ye mark that well follow me out ye ll i ll see that i ll have get paper out against ye mysel have offer reward for ye ay will i it s sore thing do between such near friends but if i get dirdum 23 this dreadful accident i ll have fend for myself man do ye see that 23 blame he spoke with pleading earnestness taking alan by breast coat ay said alan i see that ye ll have be clear country alan ay clear scotland you your friend from lowlands too for i ll have paper your friend from lowlands ye see that alan say that ye see that i thought alan flushed bit this is unco hard on me that brought him here james said he throwing his head back it s like making me traitor now alan man cried james look things face he ll be papered anyway mungo campbell ll be sure paper him what matters if i paper him too then alan i am man that has family then after little pause on both sides alan it ll be jury campbells said he there s one thing said alan musingly that naebody kens his name nor yet they shallnae alan there s my hand on that cried james for all world as if he had really known my name was foregoing some advantage but just habit he was what he looked like his age like i couldnae well do less i wonder at your father s son cried alan sternly would ye sell lad with gift would ye change his clothes then betray him no no alan said james no no habit he took off habit mungo saw him but i thought he seemed crestfallen indeed he was clutching at every straw all time i dare say saw faces his hereditary foes on bench jury box gallows background well sir says alan turning me what say ye that ye are here under safeguard my honour it s my part see nothing done but what shall please you i have but one word say said i for all this dispute i am perfect stranger but plain common sense is set blame where it belongs that is on man who fired shot paper him as ye call it set hunt on him let honest innocent folk show their faces safety but at this both alan james cried out horror bidding me hold my tongue for that was not be thought asking me what camerons would think which confirmed me it must have been cameron from mamore that did act if i did not see that lad might be caught ye havenae surely thought that said they with such innocent earnestness that my hands dropped at my side i despaired argument very well then said i paper me if you please paper alan paper king george we re all three innocent that seems be what s wanted but at least sir said i james recovering from my little fit annoyance i am alan s friend if i can be helpful friends his i will not stumble at risk i thought it best put fair face on my consent for i saw alan troubled besides thinks i myself as soon as my back is turned they will paper me as they call it whether i consent or not but this i saw i was wrong for i had no sooner said words than mrs stewart leaped out her chair came running over us wept first upon my neck then on alan s blessing god for our goodness her family as for you alan it was no more than your bounden duty she said but for this lad that has come here seen us at our worst seen goodman fleeching like suitor him that by rights should give his commands like any king as for you my lad she says my heart is wae not have your name but i have your face as long as my heart beats under my bosom i will keep it think it bless it with that she kissed me burst once more into such sobbing that i stood abashed hoot hoot said alan looking mighty silly day comes unco soon this month july morrow there ll be fine do appin fine riding dragoons crying cruachan 24 running red coats it behoves you me sooner be gone 24 rallying word campbells thereupon we said farewell set out again bending somewhat eastwards fine mild dark night over much same broken country as before chapter xx flight heather rocks sometimes we walked sometimes ran as it drew on morning walked ever less ran more though upon its face that country appeared be desert yet there were huts houses people which we must have passed more than twenty hidden quiet places hills when we came one these alan would leave me way go himself rap upon side house speak awhile at window with some sleeper awakened this was pass news which that country was so much duty that alan must pause attend it even while fleeing for his life so well attended by others that more than half houses where we called they had heard already murder others as well as i could make out standing back at distance hearing strange tongue news was received with more consternation than surprise for all our hurry day began come while we were still far from any shelter it found us prodigious valley strewn with rocks where ran foaming river wild mountains stood around it there grew there neither grass nor trees i have sometimes thought since then that it may have been valley called glencoe where massacre was time king william but for details our itinerary i am all seek our way lying now by short cuts now by great detours our pace being so hurried our time journeying usually by night names such places as i asked heard being gaelic tongue more easily forgotten first peep morning then showed us this horrible place i could see alan knit his brow this is no fit place for you me he said this is place they re bound watch with that he ran harder than ever down water side part where river was split two among three rocks it went through with horrid thundering that made my belly quake there hung over lynn little mist spray alan looked neither right nor left but jumped clean upon middle rock fell there on his hands knees check himself for that rock was small he might have pitched over on far side i had scarce time measure distance or understand peril before i had followed him he had caught stopped me so there we stood side by side upon small rock slippery with spray far broader leap front us river dinning upon all sides when i saw where i was there came on me deadly sickness fear i put my hand over my eyes alan took me shook me i saw he was speaking but roaring falls trouble my mind prevented me from hearing only i saw his face was red with anger that he stamped upon rock same look showed me water raging by mist hanging air with that i covered my eyes again shuddered next minute alan had set brandy bottle my lips forced me drink about gill which sent blood into my head again then putting his hands his mouth his mouth my ear he shouted hang or drown turning his back upon me leaped over farther branch stream landed safe i was now alone upon rock which gave me more room brandy was singing my ears i had this good example fresh before me just wit enough see that if i did not leap at once i should never leap at all i bent low on my knees flung myself forth with that kind anger despair that has sometimes stood me stead courage sure enough it was but my hands that reached full length these slipped caught again slipped again i was sliddering back into lynn when alan seized me first by hair then by collar with great strain dragged me into safety never word he said but set off running again for his life i must stagger my feet run after him i had been weary before but now i was sick bruised partly drunken with brandy i kept stumbling as i ran i had stitch that came near overmaster me when at last alan paused under great rock that stood there among number others it was none too soon for david balfour great rock i have said but by rights it was two rocks leaning together at top both some twenty feet high at first sight inaccessible even alan though you may say he had as good as four hands failed twice attempt climb them it was only at third trial then by standing on my shoulders leaping up with such force as i thought must have broken my collar bone that he secured lodgment once there he let down his leathern girdle with aid that pair shallow footholds rock i scrambled up beside him then i saw why we had come there for two rocks being both somewhat hollow on top sloping one other made kind dish or saucer where as many as three or four men might have lain hidden all this while alan had not said word had run climbed with such savage silent frenzy hurry that i knew that he was mortal fear some miscarriage even now we were on rock he said nothing nor so much as relaxed frowning look upon his face but clapped flat down keeping only one eye above edge our place shelter scouted all round compass dawn had come quite clear we could see stony sides valley its bottom which was bestrewed with rocks river which went from one side another made white falls but nowhere smoke house nor any living creature but some eagles screaming round cliff then at last alan smiled ay said he now we have chance then looking at me with some amusement ye re no very gleg 25 at jumping said he 25 brisk at this i suppose i coloured with mortification for he added at once hoots small blame ye be feared thing yet do it is what makes prettiest kind man then there was water there water s thing that dauntons even me no no said alan it s no you that s blame it s me i asked him why why said he i have proved myself gomeral this night for first all i take wrong road that my own country appin so that day has caught us where we should never have been thanks that we lie here some danger mair discomfort next which is worst two for man that has been so much among heather as myself i have come wanting water bottle here we lie for long summer s day with naething but neat spirit ye may think that small matter but before it comes night david ye ll give me news it i was anxious redeem my character offered if he would pour out brandy run down fill bottle at river i wouldnae waste good spirit either says he it s been good friend you this night or my poor opinion ye would still be cocking on yon stone what s mair says he ye may have observed you that s man so much penetration that alan breck stewart was perhaps walking quicker than his ordinar you i cried you were running fit burst was i so said he well then ye may depend upon it there was nae time be lost now here is enough said gang you your sleep lad i ll watch accordingly i lay down sleep little peaty earth had drifted between top two rocks some bracken grew there be bed me last thing i heard was still crying eagles i dare say it would be nine morning when i was roughly awakened found alan s hand pressed upon my mouth wheesht he whispered ye were snoring well said i surprised at his anxious dark face why not he peered over edge rock signed me do like it was now high day cloudless very hot valley was as clear as picture about half mile up water was camp red coats big fire blazed their midst at which some were cooking near by on top rock about as high as ours there stood sentry with sun sparkling on his arms all way down along river side were posted other sentries here near together there widelier scattered some planted like first on places command some on ground level marching counter marching so as meet half way higher up glen where ground was more open chain posts was continued by horse soldiers whom we could see distance riding fro lower down infantry continued but as stream was suddenly swelled by confluence considerable burn they were more widely set only watched fords stepping stones i took but one look at them ducked again into my place it was strange indeed see this valley which had lain so solitary hour dawn bristling with arms dotted with red coats breeches ye see said alan this was what i was afraid davie that they would watch burn side they began come about two hours ago man but ye re grand hand at sleeping we re narrow place if they get up sides hill they could easy spy us with glass but if they ll only keep foot valley we ll do yet posts are thinner down water come night we ll try our hand at getting by them what are we do till night i asked lie here says he birstle that one good scotch word birstle was indeed most story day that we had now pass you are remember that we lay on bare top rock like scones upon girdle sun beat upon us cruelly rock grew so heated man could scarce endure touch it little patch earth fern which kept cooler was only large enough for one at time we took turn about lie on naked rock which was indeed like position that saint that was martyred on gridiron it ran my mind how strange it was that same climate at only few days distance i should have suffered so cruelly first from cold upon my island now from heat upon this rock all while we had no water only raw brandy for drink which was worse than nothing but we kept bottle as cool as we could burying it earth got some relief by bathing our breasts temples soldiers kept stirring all day bottom valley now changing guard now patrolling parties hunting among rocks these lay round so great number that look for men among them was like looking for needle bottle hay being so hopeless task it was gone about with less care yet we could see soldiers pike their bayonets among heather which sent cold thrill into my vitals they would sometimes hang about our rock so that we scarce dared breathe it was this way that i first heard right english speech one fellow as he went by actually clapping his hand upon sunny face rock on which we lay plucking it off again with oath i tell you it s ot says he i was amazed at clipping tones odd sing song which he spoke no less at that strange trick dropping out letter h be sure i had heard ransome but he had taken his ways from all sorts people spoke so imperfectly at best that i set down most it childishness my surprise was all greater hear that manner speaking mouth grown man indeed i have never grown used it nor yet altogether with english grammar as perhaps very critical eye might here there spy out even these memoirs tediousness pain these hours upon rock grew only greater as day went on rock getting still hotter sun fiercer there were giddiness sickness sharp pangs like rheumatism be supported i minded then have often minded since on lines our scotch psalm moon by night thee shall not smite nor yet sun by day indeed it was only by god s blessing that we were neither us sun smitten at last about two it was beyond men s bearing there was now temptation resist as well as pain thole for sun being now got little into west there came patch shade on east side our rock which was side sheltered from soldiers as well one death as another said alan slipped over edge dropped on ground on shadowy side i followed him at once instantly fell all my length so weak was i so giddy with that long exposure here then we lay for hour or two aching from head foot as weak as water lying quite naked eye any soldier who should have strolled that way none came however all passing by on other side so that our rock continued be our shield even this new position presently we began again get little strength as soldiers were now lying closer along river side alan proposed that we should try start i was by this time afraid but one thing world that was be set back upon rock anything else was welcome me so we got ourselves at once marching order began slip from rock rock one after other now crawling flat on our bellies shade now making run for it heart mouth soldiers having searched this side valley after fashion being perhaps somewhat sleepy with sultriness afternoon had now laid by much their vigilance stood dozing at their posts or only kept look out along banks river so that this way keeping down valley at same time towards mountains we drew steadily away from their neighbourhood but business was most wearing i had ever taken part man had need hundred eyes every part him keep concealed that uneven country within cry so many scattered sentries when we must pass open place quickness was not all but swift judgment not only lie whole country but solidity every stone on which we must set foot for afternoon was now fallen so breathless that rolling pebble sounded abroad like pistol shot would start echo calling among hills cliffs by sundown we had made some distance even by our slow rate progress though be sure sentry on rock was still plainly our view but now we came on something that put all fears out season that was deep rushing burn that tore down that part join glen river at sight this we cast ourselves on ground plunged head shoulders water i cannot tell which was more pleasant great shock as cool stream went over us or greed with which we drank it we lay there for banks hid us drank again again bathed our chests let our wrists trail running water till they ached with chill at last being wonderfully renewed we got out meal bag made drammach iron pan this though it is but cold water mingled with oatmeal yet makes good enough dish for hungry man where there are no means making fire or as our case good reason for not making one it is chief stand by those who have taken heather as soon as shadow night had fallen we set forth again at first with same caution but presently with more boldness standing our full height stepping out at good pace walking way was very intricate lying up steep sides mountains along brows cliffs clouds had come with sunset night was dark cool so that i walked without much fatigue but continual fear falling rolling down mountains with no guess at our direction moon rose at last found us still on road it was its last quarter was long beset with clouds but after awhile shone out showed me many dark heads mountains was reflected far underneath us on narrow arm sea loch at this sight we both paused i struck with wonder find myself so high walking as it seemed me upon clouds alan make sure his direction seemingly he was well pleased he must certainly have judged us out ear shot all our enemies for throughout rest our night march he beguiled way with whistling many tunes warlike merry plaintive reel tunes that made foot go faster tunes my own south country that made me fain be home from my adventures all these on great dark desert mountains making company upon way chapter xxi flight heather heugh corrynakiegh early as day comes beginning july it was still dark when we reached our destination cleft head great mountain with water running through midst upon one hand shallow cave rock birches grew there thin pretty wood which little farther on was changed into wood pines burn was full trout wood cushat doves on open side mountain beyond whaups would be always whistling cuckoos were plentiful from mouth cleft we looked down upon part mamore on sea loch that divides that country from appin this from so great height as made it my continual wonder pleasure sit behold them name cleft was heugh corrynakiegh although from its height being so near upon sea it was often beset with clouds yet it was on whole pleasant place five days we lived it went happily we slept cave making our bed heather bushes which we cut for that purpose covering ourselves with alan s great coat there was low concealed place turning glen where we were so bold as make fire so that we could warm ourselves when clouds set cook hot porridge grill little trouts that we caught with our hands under stones overhanging banks burn this was indeed our chief pleasure business not only save our meal against worse times but with rivalry that much amused us we spent great part our days at water side stripped waist groping about or as they say guddling for these fish largest we got might have been quarter pound but they were good flesh flavour when broiled upon coals lacked only little salt be delicious any by time alan must teach me use my sword for my ignorance had much distressed him i think besides as i had sometimes upper hand him fishing he was not sorry turn exercise where he had so much upper hand me he made it somewhat more pain than need have been for he stormed at me all through lessons very violent manner scolding would push me so close that i made sure he must run me through body i was often tempted turn tail but held my ground for all that got some profit my lessons if it was but stand on guard with assured countenance which is often all that is required so though i could never least please my master i was not altogether displeased with myself meanwhile you are not suppose that we neglected our chief business which was get away it will be many long day alan said me on our first morning before red coats think upon seeking corrynakiegh so now we must get word sent james he must find siller for us how shall we send that word says i we are here desert place which yet we dare not leave unless ye get fowls air be your messengers i see not what we shall be able do ay said alan ye re man small contrivance david thereupon he fell muse looking embers fire presently getting piece wood he fashioned it cross four ends which he blackened on coals then he looked at me little shyly could ye lend me my button says he it seems strange thing ask gift again but i own i am laith cut another i gave him button whereupon he strung it on strip his great coat which he had used bind cross tying little sprig birch another fir he looked upon his work with satisfaction now said he there is little clachan what is called hamlet english not very far from corrynakiegh it has name koalisnacoan there there are living many friends mine whom i could trust with my life some that i am no just so sure ye see david there will be money set upon our heads james himsel is set money on them as for campbells they would never spare siller where there was stewart be hurt if it was otherwise i would go down koalisnacoan whatever trust my life into these people s hands as lightly as i would trust another with my glove but being so said i being so said he i would as lief they didnae see me there s bad folk everywhere what s far worse weak ones so when it comes dark again i will steal down into that clachan set this that i have been making window good friend mine john breck maccoll bouman 26 appin s 26 bouman is tenant who takes stock from landlord shares with him increase with all my heart says i if he finds it what is he think well says alan i wish he was man more penetration for by my troth i am afraid he will make little enough it but this is what i have my mind this cross is something nature crosstarrie or fiery cross which is signal gathering our clans yet he will know well enough clan is not rise for there it is standing his window no word with it so he will say himsel clan is not rise but there is something then he will see my button that was duncan stewart s then he will say himsel son duncan is heather has need me well said i it may be but even supposing so there is good deal heather between here forth that is very true word says alan but then john breck will see sprig birch sprig pine he will say himsel if he is man any penetration at all which i misdoubt alan will be lying wood which is both pines birches then he will think himsel that is not so very rife hereabout then he will come give us look up corrynakiegh if he does not david devil may fly away with him for what i care for he will no be worth salt his porridge eh man said i drolling with him little you re very ingenious but would it not be simpler for you write him few words black white that is excellent observe mr balfour shaws says alan drolling with me it would certainly be much simpler for me write him but it would be sore job for john breck read it he would have go school for two three years it s possible we might be wearied waiting on him so that night alan carried down his fiery cross set it bouman s window he was troubled when he came back for dogs had barked folk run out from their houses he thought he had heard clatter arms seen red coat come one doors on all accounts we lay next day borders wood kept close look out so that if it was john breck that came we might be ready guide him if it was red coats we should have time get away about noon man was be spied straggling up open side mountain sun looking round him as he came from under his hand no sooner had alan seen him than he whistled man turned came little towards us then alan would give another peep man would come still nearer so by sound whistling he was guided spot where we lay he was ragged wild bearded man about forty grossly disfigured with small pox looked both dull savage although his english was very bad broken yet alan according his very handsome use whenever i was by would suffer him speak no gaelic perhaps strange language made him appear more backward than he really was but i thought he had little good will serve us what he had was child terror alan would have had him carry message james but bouman would hear no message she was forget it he said his screaming voice would either have letter or wash his hands us i thought alan would be gravelled at that for we lacked means writing that desert but he was man more resources than i knew searched wood until he found quill cushat dove which he shaped into pen made himself kind ink with gunpowder from his horn water from running stream tearing corner from his french military commission which he carried his pocket like talisman keep him from gallows he sat down wrote as follows dear kinsman please send money by bearer place he kens your affectionate cousin s this he intrusted bouman who promised make what manner speed he best could carried it off with him down hill he was three full days gone but about five evening third we heard whistling wood which alan answered presently bouman came up water side looking for us right left he seemed less sulky than before indeed he was no doubt well pleased have got end such dangerous commission he gave us news country that it was alive with red coats that arms were being found poor folk brought trouble daily that james some his servants were already clapped prison at fort william under strong suspicion complicity it seemed it was noised on all sides that alan breck had fired shot there was bill issued for both him me with one hundred pounds reward this was all as bad as could be little note bouman had carried us from mrs stewart was miserable sadness it she besought alan not let himself be captured assuring him if he fell hands troops both he james were no better than dead men money she had sent was all that she could beg or borrow she prayed heaven we could be doing with it lastly she said she enclosed us one bills which we were described this we looked upon with great curiosity not little fear partly as man may look mirror partly as he might look into barrel enemy s gun judge if it be truly aimed alan was advertised as small pock marked active man thirty five or thereby dressed feathered hat french side coat blue with silver buttons lace great deal tarnished red waistcoat breeches black shag i as tall strong lad about eighteen wearing old blue coat very ragged old highland bonnet long homespun waistcoat blue breeches his legs bare low country shoes wanting toes speaks like lowlander has no beard alan was well enough pleased see his finery so fully remembered set down only when he came word tarnish he looked upon his lace like one little mortified as for myself i thought i cut miserable figure bill yet was well enough pleased too for since i had changed these rags description had ceased be danger become source safety alan said i you should change your clothes na troth said alan i have nae others fine sight i would be if i went back france bonnet this put second reflection my mind that if i were separate from alan his tell tale clothes i should be safe against arrest might go openly about my business nor was this all for suppose i was arrested when i was alone there was little against me but suppose i was taken company with reputed murderer my case would begin be grave for generosity s sake i dare not speak my mind upon this head but i thought it none less i thought it all more too when bouman brought out green purse with four guineas gold best part another small change true it was more than i had but then alan with less than five guineas had get as far as france i with my less than two not beyond queensferry so that taking things their proportion alan s society was not only peril my life but burden on my purse but there was no thought sort honest head my companion he believed he was serving helping protecting me what could i do but hold my peace chafe take my chance it it s little enough said alan putting purse his pocket but it ll do my business now john breck if ye will hand me over my button this gentleman me will be for taking road but bouman after feeling about hairy purse that hung front him highland manner though he wore otherwise lowland habit with sea trousers began roll his eyes strangely at last said her nainsel will loss it meaning he thought he had lost it what cried alan you will lose my button that was my father s before me now i will tell you what is my mind john breck it is my mind this is worst day s work that ever ye did since ye was born as alan spoke he set his hands on his knees looked at bouman with smiling mouth that dancing light his eyes that meant mischief his enemies perhaps bouman was honest enough perhaps he had meant cheat then finding himself alone with two us desert place cast back honesty as being safer at least all at once he seemed find that button handed it alan well it is good thing for honour maccolls said alan then me here is my button back again i thank you for parting with it which is piece with all your friendships me then he took warmest parting bouman for says he ye have done very well by me set your neck at venture i will always give you name good man lastly bouman took himself off by one way alan i getting our chattels together struck into another resume our flight chapter xxii flight heather moor some seven hours incessant hard travelling brought us early morning end range mountains front us there lay piece low broken desert land which we must now cross sun was not long up shone straight our eyes little thin mist went up from face moorland like smoke so that as alan said there might have been twenty squadron dragoons there we none wiser we sat down therefore howe hill side till mist should have risen made ourselves dish drammach held council war david said alan this is kittle bit shall we lie here till it comes night or shall we risk it stave on ahead well said i i am tired indeed but i could walk as far again if that was all ay but it isnae said alan nor yet half this is how we stand appin s fair death us south it s all campbells no be thought north well there s no muckle be gained by going north neither for you that wants get queensferry nor yet for me that wants get france well then we ll can strike east east be it says i quite cheerily but i was thinking myself o man if you would only take one point compass let me take any other it would be best for both us well then east ye see we have muirs said alan once there david it s mere pitch toss out on yon bald naked flat place where can body turn let red coats come over hill they can spy you miles away sorrow s their horses heels they would soon ride you down it s no good place david i m free say it s worse by daylight than by dark alan said i hear my way it appin s death for us we have none too much money nor yet meal longer they seek nearer they may guess where we are it s all risk i give my word go ahead until we drop alan was delighted there are whiles said he when ye are altogether too canny whiggish be company for gentleman like me but there come other whiles when ye show yoursel mettle spark it s then david that i love ye like brother mist rose died away showed us that country lying as waste as sea only moorfowl pewees crying upon it far over east herd deer moving like dots much it was red with heather much rest broken up with bogs hags peaty pools some had been burnt black heath fire another place there was quite forest dead firs standing like skeletons wearier looking desert man never saw but at least it was clear troops which was our point we went down accordingly into waste began make our toilsome devious travel towards eastern verge there were tops mountains all round you are remember from whence we might be spied at any moment so it behoved us keep hollow parts moor when these turned aside from our direction move upon its naked face with infinite care sometimes for half hour together we must crawl from one heather bush another as hunters do when they are hard upon deer it was clear day again with blazing sun water brandy bottle was soon gone altogether if i had guessed what it would be crawl half time upon my belly walk much rest stooping nearly knees i should certainly have held back from such killing enterprise toiling resting toiling again we wore away morning about noon lay down thick bush heather sleep alan took first watch it seemed me i had scarce closed my eyes before i was shaken up take second we had no clock go by alan stuck sprig heath ground serve instead so that as soon as shadow bush should fall so far east i might know rouse him but i was by this time so weary that i could have slept twelve hours at stretch i had taste sleep my throat my joints slept even when my mind was waking hot smell heather drone wild bees were like possets me every now again i would give jump find i had been dozing last time i woke i seemed come back from farther away thought sun had taken great start heavens i looked at sprig heath at that i could have cried aloud for i saw i had betrayed my trust my head was nearly turned with fear shame at what i saw when i looked out around me on moor my heart was like dying my body for sure enough body horse soldiers had come down during my sleep were drawing near us from south east spread out shape fan riding their horses fro deep parts heather when i waked alan he glanced first at soldiers then at mark position sun knitted his brows with sudden quick look both ugly anxious which was all reproach i had him what are we do now i asked we ll have play at being hares said he do ye see yon mountain pointing one on north eastern sky ay said i well then says he let us strike for that its name is ben alder it is wild desert mountain full hills hollows if we can win it before morn we may do yet but alan cried i that will take us across very coming soldiers i ken that fine said he but if we are driven back on appin we are two dead men so now david man be brisk with that he began run forward on his hands knees with incredible quickness as though it were his natural way going all time too he kept winding out lower parts moorland where we were best concealed some these had been burned or at least scathed with fire there rose our faces which were close ground blinding choking dust as fine as smoke water was long out this posture running on hands knees brings overmastering weakness weariness so that joints ache wrists faint under your weight now then indeed where was big bush heather we lay awhile panted putting aside leaves looked back at dragoons they had not spied us for they held straight on half troop i think covering about two miles ground beating it mighty thoroughly as they went i had awakened just time little later we must have fled front them instead escaping on one side even as it was least misfortune might betray us now again when grouse rose out heather with clap wings we lay as still as dead were afraid breathe aching faintness my body labouring my heart soreness my hands smarting my throat eyes continual smoke dust ashes had soon grown be so unbearable that i would gladly have given up nothing but fear alan lent me enough false kind courage continue as for himself you are bear mind that he was cumbered with great coat he had first turned crimson but as time went on redness began be mingled with patches white his breath cried whistled as it came his voice when he whispered his observations my ear during our halts sounded like nothing human yet he seemed no way dashed spirits nor did he at all abate his activity so that i was driven marvel at man s endurance at length first gloaming night we heard trumpet sound looking back from among heather saw troop beginning collect little after they had built fire camped for night about middle waste at this i begged besought that we might lie down sleep there shall be no sleep night said alan from now on these weary dragoons yours will keep crown muirland none will get out appin but winged fowls we got through nick time shall we jeopard what we ve gained na na when day comes it shall find you me fast place on ben alder alan i said it s not want will it s strength that i want if i could i would but as sure as i m alive i cannot very well then said alan i ll carry ye i looked see if he were jesting but no little man was dead earnest sight so much resolution shamed me lead away said i i ll follow he gave me one look as much as say well done david off he set again at his top speed it grew cooler even little darker but not much with coming night sky was cloudless it was still early july pretty far north darkest part that night you would have needed pretty good eyes read but for all that i have often seen it darker winter mid day heavy dew fell drenched moor like rain this refreshed me for while when we stopped breathe i had time see all about me clearness sweetness night shapes hills like things asleep fire dwindling away behind us like bright spot midst moor anger would come upon me clap that i must still drag myself agony eat dust like worm by what i have read books i think few that have held pen were ever really wearied or they would write it more strongly i had no care my life neither past nor future i scarce remembered there was such lad as david balfour i did not think myself but just each fresh step which i was sure would be my last with despair alan who was cause it with hatred alan was right trade as soldier this is officer s part make men continue do things they know not wherefore when if choice was offered they would lie down where they were be killed i dare say i would have made good enough private for these last hours it never occurred me that i had any choice but just obey as long as i was able die obeying day began come after years i thought by that time we were past greatest danger could walk upon our feet like men instead crawling like brutes but dear heart have mercy what pair we must have made going double like old grandfathers stumbling like babes as white as dead folk never word passed between us each set his mouth kept his eyes front him lifted up his foot set it down again like people lifting weights at country play 27 all while with moorfowl crying peep heather light coming slowly clearer east 27 village fair i say alan did as i did not that ever i looked at him for i had enough ado keep my feet but because it is plain he must have been as stupid with weariness as myself looked as little where we were going or we should not have walked into ambush like blind men it fell this way we were going down heathery brae alan leading i following pace or two behind like fiddler his wife when upon sudden heather gave rustle three or four ragged men leaped out next moment we were lying on our backs each with dirk at his throat i don t think i cared pain this rough handling was quite swallowed up by pains which i was already full i was too glad have stopped walking mind about dirk i lay looking up face man that held me i mind his face was black with sun his eyes very light but i was not afraid him i heard alan another whispering gaelic what they said was all one me then dirks were put up our weapons were taken away we were set face face sitting heather they are cluny s men said alan we couldnae have fallen better we re just bide here with these which are his out sentries till they can get word chief my arrival now cluny macpherson chief clan vourich had been one leaders great rebellion six years before there was price on his life i had supposed him long ago france with rest heads that desperate party even tired as i was surprise what i heard half wakened me what i cried is cluny still here ay is he so said alan still his own country kept by his own clan king george can do no more i think i would have asked farther but alan gave me put off i am rather wearied he said i would like fine get sleep without more words he rolled on his face deep heather bush seemed sleep at once there was no such thing possible for me you have heard grasshoppers whirring grass summer time well i had no sooner closed my eyes than my body above all my head belly wrists seemed be filled with whirring grasshoppers i must open my eyes again at once tumble toss sit up lie down look at sky which dazzled me or at cluny s wild dirty sentries peering out over top brae chattering each other gaelic that was all rest i had until messenger returned when as it appeared that cluny would be glad receive us we must get once more upon our feet set forward alan was excellent good spirits much refreshed by his sleep very hungry looking pleasantly forward dram dish hot collops which it seems messenger had brought him word for my part it made me sick hear eating i had been dead heavy before now i felt kind dreadful lightness which would not suffer me walk i drifted like gossamer ground seemed me cloud hills feather weight air have current like running burn which carried me fro with all that sort horror despair sat on my mind so that i could have wept at my own helplessness i saw alan knitting his brows at me supposed it was anger that gave me pang light headed fear like what child may have i remember too that i was smiling could not stop smiling hard as i tried for i thought it was out place at such time but my good companion had nothing his mind but kindness next moment two gillies had me by arms i began be carried forward with great swiftness or so it appeared me although i dare say it was slowly enough truth through labyrinth dreary glens hollows into heart that dismal mountain ben alder chapter xxiii cluny s cage we came at last foot exceeding steep wood which scrambled up craggy hillside was crowned by naked precipice it s here said one guides we struck up hill trees clung upon slope like sailors on shrouds ship their trunks were like rounds ladder by which we mounted quite at top just before rocky face cliff sprang above foliage we found that strange house which was known country as cluny s cage trunks several trees had been wattled across intervals strengthened with stakes ground behind this barricade levelled up with earth make floor tree which grew out from hillside was living centre beam roof walls were wattle covered with moss whole house had something egg shape it half hung half stood that steep hillside thicket like wasp s nest green hawthorn within it was large enough shelter five or six persons with some comfort projection cliff had been cunningly employed be fireplace smoke rising against face rock being not dissimilar colour readily escaped notice from below this was but one cluny s hiding places he had caves besides underground chambers several parts his country following reports his scouts he moved from one another as soldiers drew near or moved away by this manner living thanks affection his clan he had not only stayed all this time safety while so many others had fled or been taken slain but stayed four or five years longer only went france at last by express command his master there he soon died it is strange reflect that he may have regretted his cage upon ben alder when we came door he was seated by his rock chimney watching gillie about some cookery he was mighty plainly habited with knitted nightcap drawn over his ears smoked foul cutty pipe for all that he had manners king it was quite sight see him rise out his place welcome us well mr stewart come awa sir said he bring your friend that as yet i dinna ken name how is yourself cluny said alan i hope ye do brawly sir i am proud see ye present ye my friend laird shaws mr david balfour alan never referred my estate without touch sneer when we were alone but with strangers he rang words out like herald step by both ye gentlemen says cluny i make ye welcome my house which is queer rude place for certain but one where i have entertained royal personage mr stewart ye doubtless ken personage i have my eye we ll take dram for luck as soon as this handless man mine has collops ready we ll dine take hand at cartes as gentlemen should my life is bit driegh says he pouring out brandy i see little company sit twirl my thumbs mind upon great day that is gone by weary for another great day that we all hope will be upon road so here s toast ye restoration thereupon we all touched glasses drank i am sure i wished no ill king george if he had been there himself proper person it s like he would have done as i did no sooner had i taken out drain than i felt hugely better could look on listen still little mistily perhaps but no longer with same groundless horror distress mind it was certainly strange place we had strange host his long hiding cluny had grown have all manner precise habits like those old maid he had particular place where no one else must sit cage was arranged particular way which none must disturb cookery was one his chief fancies even while he was greeting us he kept eye collops it appears he sometimes visited or received visits from his wife one or two his nearest friends under cover night but for more part lived quite alone communicated only with his sentinels gillies that waited on him cage first thing morning one them who was barber came shaved him gave him news country which he was immoderately greedy there was no end his questions he put them as earnestly as child at some answers laughed out all bounds reason would break out again laughing at mere memory hours after barber was gone be sure there might have been purpose his questions for though he was thus sequestered like other landed gentlemen scotland stripped by late act parliament legal powers he still exercised patriarchal justice his clan disputes were brought him his hiding hole be decided men his country who would have snapped their fingers at court session laid aside revenge paid down money at bare word this forfeited hunted outlaw when he was angered which was often enough he gave his commands breathed threats punishment like any king his gillies trembled crouched away from him like children before hasty father with each them as he entered he ceremoniously shook hands both parties touching their bonnets at same time military manner altogether i had fair chance see some inner workings highland clan this with proscribed fugitive chief his country conquered troops riding upon all sides quest him sometimes within mile where he lay when least ragged fellows whom he rated threatened could have made fortune by betraying him on that first day as soon as collops were ready cluny gave them with his own hand squeeze lemon for he was well supplied with luxuries bade us draw our meal they said he meaning collops are such as i gave his royal highness this very house bating lemon juice for at that time we were glad get meat never fashed for kitchen 28 indeed there were mair dragoons than lemons my country year forty six 28 condiment i do not know if collops were truly very good but my heart rose against sight them i could eat but little all while cluny entertained us with stories prince charlie s stay cage giving us very words speakers rising from his place show us where they stood by these i gathered prince was gracious spirited boy like son race polite kings but not so wise as solomon i gathered too that while he was cage he was often drunk so fault that has since by all accounts made such wreck him had even then begun show itself we were no sooner done eating than cluny brought out old thumbed greasy pack cards such as you may find mean inn his eyes brightened his face as he proposed that we should fall playing now this was one things i had been brought up eschew like disgrace it being held by my father neither part christian nor yet gentleman set his own livelihood fish for that others on cast painted pasteboard be sure i might have pleaded my fatigue which was excuse enough but i thought it behoved that i should bear testimony i must have got very red face but i spoke steadily told them i had no call be judge others but for my own part it was matter which i had no clearness cluny stopped mingling cards what deil s name is this says he what kind whiggish canting talk is this for house cluny macpherson i will put my hand fire for mr balfour says alan he is honest mettle gentleman i would have ye bear mind who says it i bear king s name says he cocking his hat i any that i call friend are company for best but gentleman is tired should sleep if he has no mind cartes it will never hinder you me i m fit willing sir play ye any game that ye can name sir says cluny this poor house mine i would have you ken that any gentleman may follow his pleasure if your friend would like stand on his head he is welcome if either he or you or any other man is not preceesely satisfied i will be proud step outside with him i had no will that these two friends should cut their throats for my sake sir said i i am very wearied as alan says what s more as you are man that likely has sons your own i may tell you it was promise my father say nae mair say nae mair said cluny pointed me bed heather corner cage for all that he was displeased enough looked at me askance grumbled when he looked indeed it must be owned that both my scruples words which i declared them smacked somewhat covenanter were little their place among wild highland jacobites what with brandy venison strange heaviness had come over me i had scarce lain down upon bed before i fell into kind trance which i continued almost whole time our stay cage sometimes i was broad awake understood what passed sometimes i only heard voices or men snoring like voice silly river plaids upon wall dwindled down swelled out again like firelight shadows on roof i must sometimes have spoken or cried out for i remember i was now then amazed at being answered yet i was conscious no particular nightmare only general black abiding horror horror place i was bed i lay plaids on wall voices fire myself barber gillie who was doctor too was called prescribe for me but as he spoke gaelic i understood not word his opinion was too sick even ask for translation i knew well enough i was ill that was all i cared about i paid little heed while i lay this poor pass but alan cluny were most time at cards i am clear that alan must have begun by winning for i remember sitting up seeing them hard at it great glittering pile as much as sixty or hundred guineas on table it looked strange enough see all this wealth nest upon cliff side wattled about growing trees even then i thought it seemed deep water for alan be riding who had no better battle horse than green purse matter five pounds luck it seems changed on second day about noon i was wakened as usual for dinner as usual refused eat was given dram with some bitter infusion which barber had prescribed sun was shining at open door cage this dazzled offended me cluny sat at table biting pack cards alan had stooped over bed had his face close my eyes which troubled as they were with fever it seemed most shocking bigness he asked me for loan my money what for said i o just for loan said he but why i repeated i don t see hut david said alan ye wouldnae grudge me loan i would though if i had had my senses but all i thought then was get his face away i handed him my money on morning third day when we had been forty eight hours cage i awoke with great relief spirits very weak weary indeed but seeing things right size with their honest everyday appearance i had mind eat moreover rose from bed my own movement as soon as we had breakfasted stepped entry cage sat down outside top wood it was grey day with cool mild air i sat dream all morning only disturbed by passing by cluny s scouts servants coming with provisions reports for as coast was at that time clear you might almost say he held court openly when i returned he alan had laid cards aside were questioning gillie chief turned about spoke me gaelic i have no gaelic sir said i now since card question everything i said or did had power annoying cluny your name has more sense than yourself then said he angrily for it s good gaelic but point is this my scout reports all clear south question is have ye strength go i saw cards on table but no gold only heap little written papers these all on cluny s side alan besides had odd look like man not very well content i began have strong misgiving i do not know if i am as well as i should be said i looking at alan but little money we have has long way carry us alan took his under lip into his mouth looked upon ground david says he at last i ve lost it there s naked truth my money too said i your money too says alan with groan ye shouldnae have given it me i m daft when i get cartes hoot toot hoot toot said cluny it was all daffing it s all nonsense course you ll have your money back again double it if ye ll make so free with me it would be singular thing for me keep it it s not be supposed that i would be any hindrance gentlemen your situation that would be singular thing cries he began pull gold out his pocket with mighty red face alan said nothing only looked on ground will you step door with me sir said i cluny said he would be very glad followed me readily enough but he looked flustered put out now sir says i i must first acknowledge your generosity nonsensical nonsense cries cluny where s generosity this is just most unfortunate affair but what would ye have me do boxed up this bee skep cage mine but just set my friends cartes when i can get them if they lose course it s not be supposed here he came pause yes said i if they lose you give them back their money if they win they carry away yours their pouches i have said before that i grant your generosity but me sir it s very painful thing be placed this position there was little silence which cluny seemed always as if he was about speak but said nothing all time he grew redder redder face i am young man said i i ask your advice advise me as you would your son my friend fairly lost his money after having fairly gained far greater sum yours can i accept it back again would that be right part for me play whatever i do you can see for yourself it must be hard upon man any pride it s rather hard on me too mr balfour said cluny ye give me very much look man that has entrapped poor people their hurt i wouldnae have my friends come any house mine accept affronts no he cried with sudden heat anger nor yet give them so you see sir said i there is something be said upon my side this gambling is very poor employ for gentlefolks but i am still waiting your opinion i am sure if ever cluny hated any man it was david balfour he looked me all over with warlike eye i saw challenge at his lips but either my youth disarmed him or perhaps his own sense justice certainly it was mortifying matter for all concerned not least cluny more credit that he took it as he did mr balfour said he i think you are too nice covenanting but for all that you have spirit very pretty gentleman upon my honest word ye may take this money it s what i would tell my son here s my hand along with it chapter xxiv flight heather quarrel alan i were put across loch errocht under cloud night went down its eastern shore another hiding place near head loch rannoch whither we were led by one gillies from cage this fellow carried all our luggage alan s great coat bargain trotting along under burthen far less than half which used weigh me ground like stout hill pony with feather yet he was man that plain contest i could have broken on my knee doubtless it was great relief walk disencumbered perhaps without that relief consequent sense liberty lightness i could not have walked at all i was but new risen from bed sickness there was nothing state our affairs hearten me for much exertion travelling as we did over most dismal deserts scotland under cloudy heaven with divided hearts among travellers for long we said nothing marching alongside or one behind other each with set countenance i angry proud drawing what strength i had from these two violent sinful feelings alan angry ashamed ashamed that he had lost my money angry that i should take it so ill thought separation ran always stronger my mind more i approved it more ashamed i grew my approval it would be fine handsome generous thing indeed for alan turn round say me go i am most danger my company only increases yours but for me turn friend who certainly loved me say him you are great danger i am but little your friendship is burden go take your risks bear your hardships alone no that was impossible even think it privily myself made my cheeks burn yet alan had behaved like child what is worse treacherous child wheedling my money from me while i lay half conscious was scarce better than theft yet here he was trudging by my side without penny his name by what i could see quite blithe sponge upon money he had driven me beg true i was ready share it with him but it made me rage see him count upon my readiness these were two things uppermost my mind i could open my mouth upon neither without black ungenerosity so i did next worst said nothing nor so much as looked once at my companion save with tail my eye at last upon other side loch errocht going over smooth rushy place where walking was easy he could bear it no longer came close me david says he this is no way for two friends take small accident i have say that i m sorry so that s said now if you have anything ye d better say it o says i i have nothing he seemed disconcerted at which i was meanly pleased no said he with rather trembling voice but when i say i was blame why course ye were blame said i coolly you will bear me out that i have never reproached you never says he but ye ken very well that ye ve done worse are we part ye said so once before are ye say it again there s hills heather enough between here two seas david i will own i m no very keen stay where i m no wanted this pierced me like sword seemed lay bare my private disloyalty alan breck i cried then do you think i am one turn my back on you your chief need you dursn t say it my face my whole conduct s there give lie it it s true i fell asleep upon muir but that was from weariness you do wrong cast it up me which is what i never did said alan but aside from that i continued what have i done that you should even me dogs by such supposition i never yet failed friend it s not likely i ll begin with you there are things between us that i can never forget even if you can i will only say this ye david said alan very quietly that i have long been owing ye my life now i owe ye money ye should try make that burden light for me this ought have touched me manner it did but wrong manner i felt i was behaving badly was now not only angry with alan but angry with myself bargain it made me more cruel you asked me speak said i well then i will you own yourself that you have done me disservice i have had swallow affront i have never reproached you i never named thing till you did now you blame me cried i because i cannae laugh sing as if i was glad be affronted next thing will be that i m go down upon my knees thank you for it ye should think more others alan breck if ye thought more others ye would perhaps speak less about yourself when friend that likes you very well has passed over offence without word you would be blithe let it lie instead making it stick break his back with by your own way it it was you that was blame then it shouldnae be you seek quarrel aweel said alan say nae mair we fell back into our former silence came our journey s end supped lay down sleep without another word gillie put us across loch rannoch dusk next day gave us his opinion as our best route this was get us up at once into tops mountains go round by circuit turning heads glen lyon glen lochay glen dochart come down upon lowlands by kippen upper waters forth alan was little pleased with route which led us through country his blood foes glenorchy campbells he objected that by turning east we should come almost at once among athole stewarts race his own name lineage although following different chief come besides by far easier swifter way place whither we were bound but gillie who was indeed chief man cluny s scouts had good reasons give him on all hands naming force troops every district alleging finally as well as i could understand that we should nowhere be so little troubled as country campbells alan gave way at last but with only half heart it s one dowiest countries scotland said he there s naething there that i ken but heath crows campbells but i see that ye re man some penetration be it as ye please we set forth accordingly by this itinerary for best part three nights travelled on eerie mountains among well heads wild rivers often buried mist almost continually blown rained upon not once cheered by any glimpse sunshine by day we lay slept drenching heather by night incessantly clambered upon break neck hills among rude crags we often wandered we were often so involved fog that we must lie quiet till it lightened fire was never be thought our only food was drammach portion cold meat that we had carried from cage as for drink heaven knows we had no want water this was dreadful time rendered more dreadful by gloom weather country i was never warm my teeth chattered my head i was troubled with very sore throat such as i had on isle i had painful stitch my side which never left me when i slept my wet bed with rain beating above mud oozing below me it was live over again fancy worst part my adventures see tower shaws lit by lightning ransome carried below on men s backs shuan dying on round house floor or colin campbell grasping at bosom his coat from such broken slumbers i would be aroused gloaming sit up same puddle where i had slept sup cold drammach rain driving sharp my face or running down my back icy trickles mist enfolding us like as gloomy chamber or perhaps if wind blew falling suddenly apart showing us gulf some dark valley where streams were crying aloud sound infinite number rivers came up from all round this steady rain springs mountain were broken up every glen gushed water like cistern every stream was high spate had filled overflowed its channel during our night tramps it was solemn hear voice them below valleys now booming like thunder now with angry cry i could well understand story water kelpie that demon streams who is fabled keep wailing roaring at ford until coming doomed traveller alan i saw believed it or half believed it when cry river rose more than usually sharp i was little surprised though course i would still be shocked see him cross himself manner catholics during all these horrid wanderings we had no familiarity scarcely even that speech truth is that i was sickening for my grave which is my best excuse but besides that i was unforgiving disposition from my birth slow take offence slower forget it now incensed both against my companion myself for best part two days he was unweariedly kind silent indeed but always ready help always hoping as i could very well see that my displeasure would blow by for same length time i stayed myself nursing my anger roughly refusing his services passing him over with my eyes as if he had been bush or stone second night or rather peep third day found us upon very open hill so that we could not follow our usual plan lie down immediately eat sleep before we had reached place shelter grey had come pretty clear for though it still rained clouds ran higher alan looking my face showed some marks concern ye had better let me take your pack said he for perhaps ninth time since we had parted from scout beside loch rannoch i do very well i thank you said i as cold as ice alan flushed darkly i ll not offer it again he said i m not patient man david i never said you were said i which was exactly rude silly speech boy ten alan made no answer at time but his conduct answered for him henceforth it is be thought he quite forgave himself for affair at cluny s cocked his hat again walked jauntily whistled airs looked at me upon one side with provoking smile third night we were pass through western end country balquhidder it came clear cold with touch air like frost northerly wind that blew clouds away made stars bright streams were full course still made great noise among hills but i observed that alan thought no more upon kelpie was high good spirits as for me change weather came too late i had lain mire so long that as bible has it my very clothes abhorred me i was dead weary deadly sick full pains shiverings chill wind went through me sound it confused my ears this poor state i had bear from my companion something nature persecution he spoke good deal never without taunt whig was best name he had give me here he would say here s dub for ye jump my whiggie i ken you re fine jumper so on all time with gibing voice face i knew it was my own doing no one else s but i was too miserable repent i felt i could drag myself but little farther pretty soon i must lie down die on these wet mountains like sheep or fox my bones must whiten there like bones beast my head was light perhaps but i began love prospect i began glory thought such death alone desert with wild eagles besieging my last moments alan would repent then i thought he would remember when i was dead how much he owed me remembrance would be torture so i went like sick silly bad hearted schoolboy feeding my anger against fellow man when i would have been better on my knees crying on god for mercy at each alan s taunts i hugged myself ah thinks i myself i have better taunt readiness when i lie down die you will feel it like buffet your face ah what revenge ah how you will regret your ingratitude cruelty all while i was growing worse worse once i had fallen my leg simply doubling under me this had struck alan for moment but i was afoot so briskly set off again with such natural manner that he soon forgot incident flushes heat went over me then spasms shuddering stitch my side was hardly bearable at last i began feel that i could trail myself no farther with that there came on me all at once wish have it out with alan let my anger blaze be done with my life more sudden manner he had just called me whig i stopped mr stewart said i voice that quivered like fiddle string you are older than i am should know your manners do you think it either very wise or very witty cast my politics my teeth i thought where folk differed it was part gentlemen differ civilly if i did not i may tell you i could find better taunt than some yours alan had stopped opposite me his hat cocked his hands his breeches pockets his head little on one side he listened smiling evilly as i could see by starlight when i had done he began whistle jacobite air it was air made mockery general cope s defeat at preston pans hey johnnie cope are ye waukin yet are your drums beatin yet it came my mind that alan on day that battle had been engaged upon royal side why do ye take that air mr stewart said i is that remind me you have been beaten on both sides air stopped on alan s lips david said he but it s time these manners ceased i continued i mean you shall henceforth speak civilly my king my good friends campbells i am stewart began alan o says i i ken ye bear king s name but you are remember since i have been highlands i have seen good many those that bear it best i can say them is this that they would be none worse washing do you know that you insult me said alan very low i am sorry for that said i for i am not done if you distaste sermon i doubt pirliecue 29 will please you as little you have been chased field by grown men my party it seems poor kind pleasure out face boy both campbells whigs have beaten you you have run before them like hare it behoves you speak them as your betters 29 second sermon alan stood quite still tails his great coat clapping behind him wind this is pity he said at last there are things said that cannot be passed over i never asked you said i i am as ready as yourself ready said he ready i repeated i am no blower boaster like some that i could name come on drawing my sword i fell on guard as alan himself had taught me david he cried are ye daft i cannae draw upon ye david it s fair murder that was your look out when you insulted me said i it s truth cried alan he stood for moment wringing his mouth his hand like man sore perplexity it s bare truth he said drew his sword but before i could touch his blade with mine he had thrown it from him fallen ground na na he kept saying na na i cannae i cannae at this last my anger oozed all out me i found myself only sick sorry blank wondering at myself i would have given world take back what i had said but word once spoken who can recapture it i minded me all alan s kindness courage past how he had helped cheered borne with me our evil days then recalled my own insults saw that i had lost for ever that doughty friend at same time sickness that hung upon me seemed redouble pang my side was like sword for sharpness i thought i must have swooned where i stood this it was that gave me thought no apology could blot out what i had said it was needless think one none could cover offence but where apology was vain mere cry for help might bring alan back my side i put my pride away from me alan i said if ye cannae help me i must just die here he started up sitting looked at me it s true said i i m by with it o let me get into bield house i ll can die there easier i had no need pretend whether i chose or not i spoke weeping voice that would have melted heart stone can ye walk asked alan no said i not without help this last hour my legs have been fainting under me i ve stitch my side like red hot iron i cannae breathe right if i die ye ll can forgive me alan my heart i liked ye fine even when i was angriest wheesht wheesht cried alan dinna say that david man ye ken he shut his mouth upon sob let me get my arm about ye he continued that s way now lean upon me hard gude kens where there s house we re balwhidder too there should be no want houses no nor friends houses here do ye gang easier so davie ay said i i can be doing this way i pressed his arm with my hand again he came near sobbing davie said he i m no right man at all i have neither sense nor kindness i could nae remember ye were just bairn i couldnae see ye were dying on your feet davie ye ll have try forgive me o man let s say no more about it said i we re neither one us mend other that s truth we must just bear forbear man alan o but my stitch is sore is there nae house i ll find house ye david he said stoutly we ll follow down burn where there s bound be houses my poor man will ye no be better on my back o alan says i me good twelve inches taller ye re no such thing cried alan with start there may be trifling matter inch or two i m no saying i m just exactly what ye would call tall man whatever i dare say he added his voice tailing off laughable manner now when i come think it i dare say ye ll be just about right ay it ll be foot or near hand or may be even mair it was sweet laughable hear alan eat his words up fear some fresh quarrel i could have laughed had not my stitch caught me so hard but if i had laughed i think i must have wept too alan cried i what makes ye so good me what makes ye care for such thankless fellow deed i don t know said alan for just precisely what i thought i liked about ye was that ye never quarrelled now i like ye better chapter xxv balquhidder at door first house we came alan knocked which was no very safe enterprise such part highlands as braes balquhidder no great clan held rule there it was filled disputed by small septs broken remnants what they call chiefless folk driven into wild country about springs forth teith by advance campbells here were stewarts maclarens which came same thing for maclarens followed alan s chief war made but one clan with appin here too were many that old proscribed nameless red handed clan macgregors they had always been ill considered now worse than ever having credit with no side or party whole country scotland their chief macgregor macgregor was exile more immediate leader that part them about balquhidder james more rob roy s eldest son lay waiting his trial edinburgh castle they were ill blood with highlander lowlander with grahames maclarens stewarts alan who took up quarrel any friend however distant was extremely wishful avoid them chance served us very well for it was household maclarens that we found where alan was not only welcome for his name s sake but known by reputation here then i was got bed without delay doctor fetched who found me sorry plight but whether because he was very good doctor or i very young strong man i lay bedridden for no more than week before month i was able take road again with good heart all this time alan would not leave me though i often pressed him indeed his foolhardiness staying was common subject outcry with two or three friends that were let into secret he hid by day hole braes under little wood at night when coast was clear would come into house visit me i need not say if i was pleased see him mrs maclaren our hostess thought nothing good enough for such guest as duncan dhu which was name our host had pair pipes his house was much lover music this time my recovery was quite festival we commonly turned night into day soldiers let us be although once party two companies some dragoons went by bottom valley where i could see them through window as i lay bed what was much more astonishing no magistrate came near me there was no question put whence i came or whither i was going that time excitement i was as free all inquiry as though i had lain desert yet my presence was known before i left all people balquhidder adjacent parts many coming about house on visits these after custom country spreading news among their neighbours bills too had now been printed there was one pinned near foot my bed where i could read my own not very flattering portrait larger characters amount blood money that had been set upon my life duncan dhu rest that knew that i had come there alan s company could have entertained no doubt who i was many others must have had their guess for though i had changed my clothes i could not change my age or person lowland boys eighteen were not so rife these parts world above all about that time that they could fail put one thing with another connect me with bill so it was at least other folk keep secret among two or three near friends somehow it leaks out but among these clansmen it is told whole countryside they will keep it for century there was but one thing happened worth narrating that is visit i had robin oig one sons notorious rob roy he was sought upon all sides on charge carrying young woman from balfron marrying her as was alleged by force yet he stepped about balquhidder like gentleman his own walled policy it was he who had shot james maclaren at plough stilts quarrel never satisfied yet he walked into house his blood enemies as rider 30 might into public inn 30 commercial traveller duncan had time pass me word who it was we looked at one another concern you should understand it was then close upon time alan s coming two were little likely agree yet if we sent word or sought make signal it was sure arouse suspicion man under so dark cloud as macgregor he came with great show civility but like man among inferiors took off his bonnet mrs maclaren but clapped it on his head again speak duncan having thus set himself as he would have thought proper light came my bedside bowed i am given know sir says he that your name is balfour they call me david balfour said i at your service i would give ye my name return sir he replied but it s one somewhat blown upon late days it ll perhaps suffice if i tell ye that i am own brother james more drummond or macgregor whom ye will scarce have failed hear no sir said i little alarmed nor yet your father macgregor campbell i sat up bowed bed for i thought best compliment him case he was proud having had outlaw his father he bowed return but what i am come say sir he went on is this year 45 my brother raised part gregara marched six companies strike stroke for good side surgeon that marched with our clan cured my brother s leg when it was broken brush at preston pans was gentleman same name precisely as yourself he was brother balfour baith if you are any reasonable degree nearness one that gentleman s kin i have come put myself my people at your command you are remember that i knew no more my descent than any cadger s dog my uncle be sure had prated some our high connections but nothing present purpose there was nothing left me but that bitter disgrace owning that i could not tell robin told me shortly he was sorry he had put himself about turned his back upon me without sign salutation as he went towards door i could hear him telling duncan that i was only some kinless loon that didn t know his own father angry as i was at these words ashamed my own ignorance i could scarce keep from smiling that man who was under lash law was indeed hanged some three years later should be so nice as descent his acquaintances just door he met alan coming two drew back looked at each other like strange dogs they were neither them big men but they seemed fairly swell out with pride each wore sword by movement his haunch thrust clear hilt it so that it might be more readily grasped blade drawn mr stewart i am thinking says robin troth mr macgregor it s not name be ashamed answered alan i did not know ye were my country sir says robin it sticks my mind that i am country my friends maclarens says alan that s kittle point returned other there may be two words say that but i think i will have heard that you are man your sword unless ye were born deaf mr macgregor ye will have heard good deal more than that says alan i am not only man that can draw steel appin when my kinsman captain ardshiel had talk with gentleman your name not so many years back i could never hear that macgregor had best it do ye mean my father sir says robin well i wouldnae wonder said alan gentleman i have my mind had ill taste clap campbell his name my father was old man returned robin match was unequal you me would make better pair sir i was thinking that said alan i was half out bed duncan had been hanging at elbow these fighting cocks ready intervene upon least occasion but when that word was uttered it was case now or never duncan with something white face be sure thrust himself between gentlemen said he i will have been thinking very different matter whateffer here are my pipes here are you two gentlemen who are baith acclaimed pipers it s auld dispute which one ye s best here will be braw chance settle it why sir said alan still addressing robin from whom indeed he had not so much as shifted his eyes nor yet robin from him why sir says alan i think i will have heard some sough 31 sort have ye music as folk say are ye bit piper 31 rumour i can pipe like macrimmon cries robin that is very bold word quoth alan i have made bolder words good before now returned robin that against better adversaries it is easy try that says alan duncan dhu made haste bring out pair pipes that was his principal possession set before his guests mutton ham bottle that drink which they call athole brose which is made old whiskey strained honey sweet cream slowly beaten together right order proportion two enemies were still on very breach quarrel but down they sat one upon each side peat fire with mighty show politeness maclaren pressed them taste his mutton ham wife s brose reminding them wife was out athole had name far wide for her skill that confection but robin put aside these hospitalities as bad for breath i would have ye remark sir said alan that i havenae broken bread for near upon ten hours which will be worse for breath than any brose scotland i will take no advantages mr stewart replied robin eat drink i ll follow you each ate small portion ham drank glass brose mrs maclaren then after great number civilities robin took pipes played little spring very ranting manner ay ye can blow said alan taking instrument from his rival he first played same spring manner identical with robin s then wandered into variations which as he went on he decorated with perfect flight grace notes such as pipers love call warblers i had been pleased with robin s playing alan s ravished me that s no very bad mr stewart said rival but ye show poor device your warblers me cried alan blood starting his face i give ye lie do ye own yourself beaten at pipes then said robin that ye seek change them for sword that s very well said mr macgregor returned alan meantime laying strong accent on word i take back lie i appeal duncan indeed ye need appeal naebody said robin ye re far better judge than any maclaren balquhidder for it s god s truth that you re very creditable piper for stewart hand me pipes alan did as he asked robin proceeded imitate correct some part alan s variations which it seemed that he remembered perfectly ay ye have music said alan gloomily now be judge yourself mr stewart said robin taking up variations from beginning he worked them throughout so new purpose with such ingenuity sentiment with so odd fancy so quick knack grace notes that i was amazed hear him as for alan his face grew dark hot he sat gnawed his fingers like man under some deep affront enough he cried ye can blow pipes make most that he made as if rise but robin only held out his hand as if ask for silence struck into slow measure pibroch it was fine piece music itself nobly played but it seems besides it was piece peculiar appin stewarts chief favourite with alan first notes were scarce out before there came change his face when time quickened he seemed grow restless his seat long before that piece was at end last signs his anger died from him he had no thought but for music robin oig he said when it was done ye are great piper i am not fit blow same kingdom with ye body me ye have mair music your sporran than i have my head though it still sticks my mind that i could maybe show ye another it with cold steel i warn ye beforehand it ll no be fair it would go against my heart haggle man that can blow pipes as you can thereupon that quarrel was made up all night long brose was going pipes changing hands day had come pretty bright three men were none better for what they had been taking before robin as much as thought upon road chapter xxvi end flight we pass forth month as i have said was not yet out but it was already far through august beautiful warm weather with every sign early great harvest when i was pronounced able for my journey our money was now run so low ebb that we must think first all on speed for if we came not soon mr rankeillor s or if when we came there he should fail help me we must surely starve alan s view besides hunt must have now greatly slackened line forth even stirling bridge which is main pass over that river would be watched with little interest it s chief principle military affairs said he go where ye are least expected forth is our trouble ye ken saying forth bridles wild hielandman well if we seek creep round about head that river come down by kippen or balfron it s just precisely there that they ll be looking lay hands on us but if we stave on straight auld brig stirling i ll lay my sword they let us pass unchallenged first night accordingly we pushed house maclaren strathire friend duncan s where we slept twenty first month whence we set forth again about fall night make another easy stage twenty second we lay heather bush on hillside uam var within view herd deer happiest ten hours sleep fine breathing sunshine on bone dry ground that i have ever tasted that night we struck allan water followed it down coming edge hills saw whole carse stirling underfoot as flat as pancake with town castle on hill midst it moon shining on links forth now said alan i kenna if ye care but ye re your own land again we passed hieland line first hour now if we could but pass yon crooked water we might cast our bonnets air allan water near by where it falls into forth we found little sandy islet overgrown with burdock butterbur like low plants that would just cover us if we lay flat here it was we made our camp within plain view stirling castle whence we could hear drums beat as some part garrison paraded shearers worked all day field on one side river we could hear stones going on hooks voices even words men talking it behoved lie close keep silent but sand little isle was sun warm green plants gave us shelter for our heads we had food drink plenty crown all we were within sight safety as soon as shearers quit their work dusk began fall we waded ashore struck for bridge stirling keeping fields under field fences bridge is close under castle hill old high narrow bridge with pinnacles along parapet you may conceive with how much interest i looked upon it not only as place famous history but as very doors salvation alan myself moon was not yet up when we came there few lights shone along front fortress lower down few lighted windows town but it was all mighty still there seemed be no guard upon passage i was for pushing straight across but alan was more wary it looks unco quiet said he but for all that we ll lie down here cannily behind dyke make sure so we lay for about quarter hour whiles whispering whiles lying still hearing nothing earthly but washing water on piers at last there came by old hobbling woman with crutch stick who first stopped little close where we lay bemoaned herself long way she had travelled then set forth again up steep spring bridge woman was so little night still so dark that we soon lost sight her only heard sound her steps her stick cough that she had by fits draw slowly farther away she s bound be across now i whispered na said alan her foot still sounds boss 32 upon bridge 32 hollow just then who goes cried voice we heard butt musket rattle on stones i must suppose sentry had been sleeping so that had we tried we might have passed unseen but he was awake now chance forfeited this ll never do said alan this ll never never do for us david without another word he began crawl away through fields little after being well out eye shot got his feet again struck along road that led eastward i could not conceive what he was doing indeed i was so sharply cut by disappointment that i was little likely be pleased with anything moment back i had seen myself knocking at mr rankeillor s door claim my inheritance like hero ballad here was i back again wandering hunted blackguard on wrong side forth well said i well said alan what would ye have they re none such fools as i took them for we have still forth pass davie weary fall rains that fed hillsides that guided it why go east said i ou just upon chance said he if we cannae pass river we ll have see what we can do for firth there are fords upon river none upon firth said i be sure there are fords bridge forbye quoth alan what service when they are watched well said i but river can be swum by them that have skill it returned he but i have yet hear that either you or me is much hand at that exercise for my own part i swim like stone i m not up you talking back alan i said but i can see we re making bad worse if it s hard pass river it stands reason it must be worse pass sea but there s such thing as boat says alan or i m more deceived ay such thing as money says i but for us that have neither one nor other they might just as well not have been invented ye think so said alan i do that said i david says he ye re man small invention less faith but let me set my wits upon hone if i cannae beg borrow nor yet steal boat i ll make one i think i see ye said i what s more than all that if ye pass bridge it can tell no tales but if we pass firth there s boat on wrong side somebody must have brought it country side will all be bizz man cried alan if i make boat i ll make body take it back again so deave me with no more your nonsense but walk for that s what you ve got do let alan think for ye all night then we walked through north side carse under high line ochil mountains by alloa clackmannan culross all which we avoided about ten morning mighty hungry tired came little clachan limekilns this is place that sits near by water side looks across hope town queensferry smoke went up from both these from other villages farms upon all hands fields were being reaped two ships lay anchored boats were coming going on hope it was altogether right pleasant sight me i could not take my fill gazing at these comfortable green cultivated hills busy people both field sea for all that there was mr rankeillor s house on south shore where i had no doubt wealth awaited me here was i upon north clad poor enough attire outlandish fashion with three silver shillings left me all my fortune price set upon my head outlawed man for my sole company o alan said i think it over there there s all that heart could want waiting me birds go over boats go over all that please can go but just me only o man but it s heart break limekilns we entered small change house which we only knew be public by wand over door bought some bread cheese from good looking lass that was servant this we carried with us bundle meaning sit eat it bush wood on sea shore that we saw some third part mile front as we went i kept looking across water sighing myself though i took no heed it alan had fallen into muse at last he stopped way did ye take heed lass we bought this says he tapping on bread cheese be sure said i bonny lass she was ye thought that cries he man david that s good news name all that s wonderful why so says i what good can that do well said alan with one his droll looks i was rather hopes it would maybe get us that boat if it were other way about it would be liker it said i that s all that you ken ye see said alan i don t want lass fall love with ye i want her be sorry for ye david which end there is no manner need that she should take you for beauty let me see looking me curiously over i wish ye were wee thing paler but apart from that ye ll do fine for my purpose ye have fine hang dog rag tatter clappermaclaw kind look ye as if ye had stolen coat from potato bogle come right about back change house for that boat ours i followed him laughing david balfour said he ye re very funny gentleman by your way it this is very funny employ for ye no doubt for all that if ye have any affection for my neck say nothing your own ye will perhaps be kind enough take this matter responsibly i am going do bit play acting bottom ground which is just exactly as serious as gallows for pair us so bear it if ye please mind conduct yourself according well well said i have it as you will as we got near clachan he made me take his arm hang upon it like one almost helpless with weariness by time he pushed open change house door he seemed be half carrying me maid appeared surprised as well she might be at our speedy return but alan had no words spare for her explanation helped me chair called for tass brandy with which he fed me little sips then breaking up bread cheese helped me eat it like nursery lass whole with that grave concerned affectionate countenance that might have imposed upon judge it was small wonder if maid were taken with picture we presented poor sick overwrought lad his most tender comrade she drew quite near stood leaning with her back on next table what s like wrong with him said she at last alan turned upon her my great wonder with kind fury wrong cries he he s walked more hundreds miles than he has hairs upon his chin slept oftener wet heather than dry sheets wrong quo she wrong enough i would think wrong indeed he kept grumbling himself as he fed me like man ill pleased he s young for like that said maid ower young said alan with his back her he would be better riding says she where could i get horse him cried alan turning on her with same appearance fury would ye have me steal i thought this roughness would have sent her off dudgeon as indeed it closed her mouth for time but my companion knew very well what he was doing for as simple as he was some things life had great fund roguishness such affairs as these ye neednae tell me she said at last ye re gentry well said alan softened little i believe against his will by this artless comment suppose we were did ever you hear that gentrice put money folk s pockets she sighed at this as if she were herself some disinherited great lady no says she that s true indeed i was all this while chafing at part i played sitting tongue tied between shame merriment but somehow at this i could hold no longer bade alan let me be for i was better already my voice stuck my throat for i ever hated take part lies but my very embarrassment helped on plot for lass no doubt set down my husky voice sickness fatigue has he nae friends said she tearful voice that has he so cried alan if we could but win them friends rich friends beds lie food eat doctors see him here he must tramp dubs sleep heather like beggarman why that says lass my dear said alan i cannae very safely say but i ll tell ye what i ll do instead says he i ll whistle ye bit tune with that he leaned pretty far over table mere breath whistle but with wonderful pretty sentiment gave her few bars charlie is my darling wheesht says she looked over her shoulder door that s it said alan him so young cries lass he s old enough alan struck his forefinger on back part his neck meaning that i was old enough lose my head it would be black shame she cried flushing high it s what will be though said alan unless we manage better at this lass turned ran out that part house leaving us alone together alan high good humour at furthering his schemes i bitter dudgeon at being called jacobite treated like child alan i cried i can stand no more this ye ll have sit it then davie said he for if ye upset pot now ye may scrape your own life out fire but alan breck is dead man this was so true that i could only groan even my groan served alan s purpose for it was overheard by lass as she came flying again with dish white puddings bottle strong ale poor lamb says she had no sooner set meat before us than she touched me on shoulder with little friendly touch as much as bid me cheer up then she told us fall there would be no more pay for inn was her own or at least her father s he was gone for day pittencrieff we waited for no second bidding for bread cheese is but cold comfort puddings smelt excellently well while we sat ate she took up that same place by next table looking on thinking frowning herself drawing string her apron through her hand i m thinking ye have rather long tongue she said at last alan ay said alan but ye see i ken folk i speak i would never betray ye said she if ye mean that no said he ye re not that kind but i ll tell ye what ye would do ye would help i couldnae said she shaking her head na i couldnae no said he but if ye could she answered him nothing look here my lass said alan there are boats kingdom fife for i saw two no less upon beach as i came by your town s end now if we could have use boat pass under cloud night into lothian some secret decent kind man bring that boat back again keep his counsel there would be two souls saved mine all likelihood his dead surety if we lack that boat we have but three shillings left this wide world where go how do what other place there is for us except chains gibbet i give you my naked word i kenna shall we go wanting lassie are ye lie your warm bed think upon us when wind gowls chimney rain tirls on roof are ye eat your meat by cheeks red fire think upon this poor sick lad mine biting his finger ends on blae muir for cauld hunger sick or sound he must aye be moving with death grapple at his throat he must aye be trailing rain on lang roads when he gants his last on rickle cauld stanes there will be nae friends near him but only me god at this appeal i could see lass was great trouble mind being tempted help us yet some fear she might be helping malefactors so now i determined step myself allay her scruples with portion truth did ever you hear said i mr rankeillor ferry rankeillor writer said she i daur say that well said i it s his door that i am bound so you may judge by that if i am ill doer i will tell you more that though i am indeed by dreadful error some peril my life king george has no truer friend all scotland than myself her face cleared up mightily at this although alan s darkened that s more than i would ask said she mr rankeillor is kennt man she bade us finish our meat get clear clachan as soon as might be lie close bit wood on sea beach ye can trust me says she i ll find some means put you over at this we waited for no more but shook hands with her upon bargain made short work puddings set forth again from limekilns as far as wood it was small piece perhaps score elders hawthorns few young ashes not thick enough veil us from passersby upon road or beach here we must lie however making best brave warm weather good hopes we now had deliverance planing more particularly what remained for us do we had but one trouble all day when strolling piper came sat same wood with us red nosed bleareyed drunken dog with great bottle whisky his pocket long story wrongs that had been done him by all sorts persons from lord president court session who had denied him justice down bailies inverkeithing who had given him more it than he desired it was impossible but he should conceive some suspicion two men lying all day concealed thicket having no business allege as long as he stayed there he kept us hot water with prying questions after he was gone as he was man not very likely hold his tongue we were greater impatience be gone ourselves day came end with same brightness night fell quiet clear lights came out houses hamlets then one after another began be put out but it was past eleven we were long since strangely tortured with anxieties before we heard grinding oars upon rowing pins at that we looked out saw lass herself coming rowing us boat she had trusted no one with our affairs not even her sweetheart if she had one but as soon as her father was asleep had left house by window stolen neighbour s boat come our assistance single handed i was abashed how find expression for my thanks but she was no less abashed at thought hearing them begged us lose no time hold our peace saying very properly that heart our matter was haste silence so what with one thing another she had set us on lothian shore not far from carriden had shaken hands with us was out again at sea rowing for limekilns before there was one word said either her service or our gratitude even after she was gone we had nothing say as indeed nothing was enough for such kindness only alan stood great while upon shore shaking his head it is very fine lass he said at last david it is very fine lass matter hour later as we were lying den on sea shore i had been already dozing he broke out again commendations her character for my part i could say nothing she was so simple creature that my heart smote me both with remorse fear remorse because we had traded upon her ignorance fear lest we should have anyway involved her dangers our situation chapter xxvii i come mr rankeillor next day it was agreed that alan should fend for himself till sunset but as soon as it began grow dark he should lie fields by roadside near newhalls stir for naught until he heard me whistling at first i proposed i should give him for signal bonnie house airlie which was favourite mine but he objected that as piece was very commonly known any ploughman might whistle it by accident taught me instead little fragment highland air which has run my head from that day this will likely run my head when i lie dying every time it comes me it takes me off that last day my uncertainty with alan sitting up bottom den whistling beating measure with finger grey dawn coming on his face i was long street queensferry before sun was up it was fairly built burgh houses good stone many slated town hall not so fine i thought as that peebles nor yet street so noble but take it altogether it put me shame for my foul tatters as morning went on fires began be kindled windows open people appear out houses my concern despondency grew ever blacker i saw now that i had no grounds stand upon no clear proof my rights nor so much as my own identity if it was all bubble i was indeed sorely cheated left sore pass even if things were as i conceived it would all likelihood take time establish my contentions what time had i spare with less than three shillings my pocket condemned hunted man upon my hands ship out country truly if my hope broke with me it might come gallows yet for both us as i continued walk up down saw people looking askance at me upon street or out windows nudging or speaking one another with smiles i began take fresh apprehension that it might be no easy matter even come speech lawyer far less convince him my story for life me i could not muster up courage address any these reputable burghers i thought shame even speak with them such pickle rags dirt if i had asked for house such man as mr rankeillor i suppose they would have burst out laughing my face so i went up down through street down harbour side like dog that has lost its master with strange gnawing my inwards every now then movement despair it grew be high day at last perhaps nine forenoon i was worn with these wanderings chanced have stopped front very good house on landward side house with beautiful clear glass windows flowering knots upon sills walls new harled 33 chase dog sitting yawning on step like one that was at home well i was even envying this dumb brute when door fell open there issued forth shrewd ruddy kindly consequential man well powdered wig spectacles i was such plight that no one set eyes on me once but he looked at me again this gentleman as it proved was so much struck with my poor appearance that he came straight up me asked me what i did 33 newly rough cast i told him i was come queensferry on business taking heart grace asked him direct me house mr rankeillor why said he that is his house that i have just come out for rather singular chance i am that very man then sir said i i have beg favour interview i do not know your name said he nor yet your face my name is david balfour said i david balfour he repeated rather high tone like one surprised where have you come from mr david balfour he asked looking me pretty drily face i have come from great many strange places sir said i but i think it would be as well tell you where how more private manner he seemed muse awhile holding his lip his hand looking now at me now upon causeway street yes says he that will be best no doubt he led me back with him into his house cried out some one whom i could not see that he would be engaged all morning brought me into little dusty chamber full books documents here he sate down bade me be seated though i thought he looked little ruefully from his clean chair my muddy rags now says he if you have any business pray be brief come swiftly point nec gemino bellum trojanum orditur ab ovo do you understand that says he with keen look i will even do as horace says sir i answered smiling carry you medias res he nodded as if he was well pleased indeed his scrap latin had been set test me for all that though i was somewhat encouraged blood came my face when i added i have reason believe myself some rights on estate shaws he got paper book out drawer set it before him open well said he but i had shot my bolt sat speechless come come mr balfour said he you must continue where were you born essendean sir said i year 1733 12th march he seemed follow this statement his paper book but what that meant i knew not your father mother said he my father was alexander balfour schoolmaster that place said i my mother grace pitarrow i think her people were from angus have you any papers proving your identity asked mr rankeillor no sir said i but they are hands mr campbell minister could be readily produced mr campbell too would give me his word for that matter i do not think my uncle would deny me meaning mr ebenezer balfour says he same said i whom you have seen he asked by whom i was received into his own house i answered did you ever meet man name hoseason asked mr rankeillor i did so sir for my sins said i for it was by his means procurement my uncle that i was kidnapped within sight this town carried sea suffered shipwreck hundred other hardships stand before you day this poor accoutrement you say you were shipwrecked said rankeillor where was that off south end isle mull said i name isle on which i was cast up is island earraid ah says he smiling you are deeper than me geography but so far i may tell you this agrees pretty exactly with other informations that i hold but you say you were kidnapped what sense plain meaning word sir said i i was on my way your house when i was trepanned on board brig cruelly struck down thrown below knew no more anything till we were far at sea i was destined for plantations fate that god s providence i have escaped brig was lost on june 27th says he looking his book we are now at august 24th here is considerable hiatus mr balfour near upon two months it has already caused vast amount trouble your friends i own i shall not be very well contented until it is set right indeed sir said i these months are very easily filled up but yet before i told my story i would be glad know that i was talking friend this is argue circle said lawyer i cannot be convinced till i have heard you i cannot be your friend till i am properly informed if you were more trustful it would better befit your time life you know mr balfour we have proverb country that evil doers are aye evil dreaders you are not forget sir said i that i have already suffered by my trustfulness was shipped off be slave by very man that if i rightly understand is your employer all this while i had been gaining ground with mr rankeillor proportion as i gained ground gaining confidence but at this sally which i made with something smile myself he fairly laughed aloud no no said he it is not so bad as that fui non sum i was indeed your uncle s man business but while you imberbis juvenis custode remoto were gallivanting west good deal water has run under bridges if your ears did not sing it was not for lack being talked about on very day your sea disaster mr campbell stalked into my office demanding you from all winds i had never heard your existence but i had known your father from matters my competence be touched upon hereafter i was disposed fear worst mr ebenezer admitted having seen you declared what seemed improbable that he had given you considerable sums that you had started for continent europe intending fulfil your education which was probable praiseworthy interrogated how you had come send no word mr campbell he deponed that you had expressed great desire break with your past life further interrogated where you now were protested ignorance but believed you were leyden that is close sum his replies i am not exactly sure that any one believed him continued mr rankeillor with smile particular he so much disrelished me expressions mine that word he showed me door we were then at full stand for whatever shrewd suspicions we might entertain we had no shadow probation very article comes captain hoseason with story your drowning whereupon all fell through with no consequences but concern mr campbell injury my pocket another blot upon your uncle s character which could very ill afford it now mr balfour said he you understand whole process these matters can judge for yourself what extent i may be trusted indeed he was more pedantic than i can represent him placed more scraps latin his speech but it was all uttered with fine geniality eye manner which went far conquer my distrust moreover i could see he now treated me as if i was myself beyond doubt so that first point my identity seemed fully granted sir said i if i tell you my story i must commit friend s life your discretion pass me your word it shall be sacred for what touches myself i will ask no better guarantee than just your face he passed me his word very seriously but said he these are rather alarming prolocutions if there are your story any little jostles law i would beg you bear mind that i am lawyer pass lightly thereupon i told him my story from first he listening with his spectacles thrust up his eyes closed so that i sometimes feared he was asleep but no such matter he heard every word as i found afterward with such quickness hearing precision memory as often surprised me even strange outlandish gaelic names heard for that time only he remembered would remind me years after yet when i called alan breck full we had odd scene name alan had course rung through scotland with news appin murder offer reward it had no sooner escaped me than lawyer moved his seat opened his eyes i would name no unnecessary names mr balfour said he above all highlanders many whom are obnoxious law well it might have been better not said i but since i have let it slip i may as well continue not at all said mr rankeillor i am somewhat dull hearing as you may have remarked i am far from sure i caught name exactly we will call your friend if you please mr thomson that there may be no reflections future i would take some such way with any highlander that you may have mention dead or alive by this i saw he must have heard name all too clearly had already guessed i might be coming murder if he chose play this part ignorance it was no matter mine so i smiled said it was no very highland sounding name consented through all rest my story alan was mr thomson which amused me more as it was piece policy after his own heart james stewart like manner was mentioned under style mr thomson s kinsman colin campbell passed as mr glen cluny when i came that part my tale i gave name mr jameson highland chief it was truly most open farce i wondered that lawyer should care keep it up but after all it was quite taste that age when there were two parties state quiet persons with no very high opinions their own sought out every cranny avoid offence either well well said lawyer when i had quite done this is great epic great odyssey yours you must tell it sir sound latinity when your scholarship is riper or english if you please though for my part i prefer stronger tongue you have rolled much qu regio terris what parish scotland make homely translation has not been filled with your wanderings you have shown besides singular aptitude for getting into false positions yes upon whole for behaving well them this mr thomson seems me gentleman some choice qualities though perhaps trifle bloody minded it would please me none worse if with all his merits he were soused north sea for man mr david is sore embarrassment but you are doubtless quite right adhere him indubitably he adhered you it comes we may say he was your true companion nor less paribus curis vestigia figit for i dare say you would both take orra thought upon gallows well well these days are fortunately by i think speaking humanly that you are near end your troubles as he thus moralised on my adventures he looked upon me with so much humour benignity that i could scarce contain my satisfaction i had been so long wandering with lawless people making my bed upon hills under bare sky that sit once more clean covered house talk amicably with gentleman broadcloth seemed mighty elevations even as i thought so my eye fell on my unseemly tatters i was once more plunged confusion but lawyer saw understood me he rose called over stair lay another plate for mr balfour would stay dinner led me into bedroom upper part house here he set before me water soap comb laid out some clothes that belonged his son here with another apposite tag he left me my toilet chapter xxviii i go quest my inheritance having made what change i could my appearance blithe was i look glass find beggarman thing past david balfour come life again yet i was ashamed change too above all borrowed clothes when i had done mr rankeillor caught me on stair made me his compliments had me again into cabinet sit ye down mr david said he now that you are looking little more like yourself let me see if i can find you any news you will be wondering no doubt about your father your uncle be sure it is singular tale explanation is one that i blush have offer you for says he really with embarrassment matter hinges on love affair truly said i i cannot very well join that notion with my uncle but your uncle mr david was not always old replied lawyer what may perhaps surprise you more not always ugly he had fine gallant air people stood their doors look after him as he went by upon mettle horse i have seen it with these eyes i ingenuously confess not altogether without envy for i was plain lad myself plain man s son those days it was case odi te qui bellus es sabelle it sounds like dream said i ay ay said lawyer that is how it is with youth age nor was that all but he had spirit his own that seemed promise great things future 1715 what must he do but run away join rebels it was your father that pursued him found him ditch brought him back multum gementem mirth whole country however majora canamus two lads fell love that with same lady mr ebenezer who was admired beloved spoiled one made no doubt mighty certain victory when he found he had deceived himself screamed like peacock whole country heard it now he lay sick at home with his silly family standing round bed tears now he rode from public house public house shouted his sorrows into lug tom dick harry your father mr david was kind gentleman but he was weak dolefully weak took all this folly with long countenance one day by your leave resigned lady she was no such fool however it s from her you must inherit your excellent good sense she refused be bandied from one another both got upon their knees her upshot matter for that while was that she showed both them door that was august dear me same year i came from college scene must have been highly farcical i thought myself it was silly business but i could not forget my father had hand it surely sir it had some note tragedy said i why no sir not at all returned lawyer for tragedy implies some ponderable matter dispute some dignus vindice nodus this piece work was all about petulance young ass that had been spoiled wanted nothing so much as be tied up soundly belted however that was not your father s view end it was that from concession concession on your father s part from one height another squalling sentimental selfishness upon your uncle s they came at last drive sort bargain from whose ill results you have recently been smarting one man took lady other estate now mr david they talk great deal charity generosity but this disputable state life i often think happiest consequences seem flow when gentleman consults his lawyer takes all law allows him anyhow this piece quixotry on your father s part as it was unjust itself has brought forth monstrous family injustices your father mother lived died poor folk you were poorly reared meanwhile what time it has been for tenants on estate shaws i might add if it was matter i cared much about what time for mr ebenezer yet that is certainly strangest part all said i that man s nature should thus change true said mr rankeillor yet i imagine it was natural enough he could not think that he had played handsome part those who knew story gave him cold shoulder those who knew it not seeing one brother disappear other succeed estate raised cry murder so that upon all sides he found himself evited money was all he got by his bargain well he came think more money he was selfish when he was young he is selfish now that he is old latter end all these pretty manners fine feelings you have seen for yourself well sir said i all this what is my position estate is yours beyond doubt replied lawyer it matters nothing what your father signed you are heir entail but your uncle is man fight indefensible it would be likely your identity that he would call question lawsuit is always expensive family lawsuit always scandalous besides which if any your doings with your friend mr thomson were come out we might find that we had burned our fingers kidnapping be sure would be court card upon our side if we could only prove it but it may be difficult prove my advice upon whole is make very easy bargain with your uncle perhaps even leaving him at shaws where he has taken root for quarter century contenting yourself meanwhile with fair provision i told him i was very willing be easy that carry family concerns before public was step from which i was naturally much averse meantime thinking myself i began see outlines that scheme on which we afterwards acted great affair i asked is bring home him kidnapping surely said mr rankeillor if possible out court for mark you here mr david we could no doubt find some men covenant who would swear your reclusion but once they were box we could no longer check their testimony some word your friend mr thomson must certainly crop out which from what you have let fall i cannot think be desirable well sir said i here is my way it i opened my plot him but this would seem involve my meeting man thomson says he when i had done i think so indeed sir said i dear doctor cries he rubbing his brow dear doctor no mr david i am afraid your scheme is inadmissible i say nothing against your friend mr thomson i know nothing against him if i did mark this mr david it would be my duty lay hands on him now i put it you is it wise meet he may have matters his charge he may not have told you all his name may not be even thomson cries lawyer twinkling for some these fellows will pick up names by roadside as another would gather haws you must be judge sir said i but it was clear my plan had taken hold upon his fancy for he kept musing himself till we were called dinner company mrs rankeillor that lady had scarce left us again ourselves bottle wine ere he was back harping on my proposal when where was i meet my friend mr thomson was i sure mr t s discretion supposing we could catch old fox tripping would i consent such such term agreement these like questions he kept asking at long intervals while he thoughtfully rolled his wine upon his tongue when i had answered all them seemingly his contentment he fell into still deeper muse even claret being now forgotten then he got sheet paper pencil set work writing weighing every word at last touched bell had his clerk into chamber torrance said he i must have this written out fair against night when it is done you will be so kind as put on your hat be ready come along with this gentleman me for you will probably be wanted as witness what sir cried i as soon as clerk was gone are you venture it why so it would appear says he filling his glass but let us speak no more business very sight torrance brings my head little droll matter some years ago when i had made tryst with poor oaf at cross edinburgh each had gone his proper errand when it came four o clock torrance had been taking glass did not know his master i who had forgot my spectacles was so blind without them that i give you my word i did not know my own clerk thereupon he laughed heartily i said it was odd chance smiled out politeness but what held me all afternoon wonder he kept returning dwelling on this story telling it again with fresh details laughter so that i began at last be quite put out countenance feel ashamed for my friend s folly towards time i had appointed with alan we set out from house mr rankeillor i arm arm torrance following behind with deed his pocket covered basket his hand all through town lawyer was bowing right left continually being button holed by gentlemen on matters burgh or private business i could see he was one greatly looked up county at last we were clear houses began go along side haven towards hawes inn ferry pier scene my misfortune i could not look upon place without emotion recalling how many that had been there with me that day were now no more ransome taken i could hope from evil come shuan passed where i dared not follow him poor souls that had gone down with brig her last plunge all these brig herself i had outlived come through these hardships fearful perils without scath my only thought should have been gratitude yet i could not behold place without sorrow for others chill recollected fear i was so thinking when upon sudden mr rankeillor cried out clapped his hand his pockets began laugh why he cries if this be not farcical adventure after all that i said i have forgot my glasses at that course i understood purpose his anecdote knew that if he had left his spectacles at home it had been done on purpose so that he might have benefit alan s help without awkwardness recognising him indeed it was well thought upon for now suppose things go very worst how could rankeillor swear my friend s identity or how be made bear damaging evidence against myself for all that he had been long while finding out his want had spoken recognised good few persons as we came through town i had little doubt myself that he saw reasonably well as soon as we were past hawes where i recognised landlord smoking his pipe door was amazed see him look no older mr rankeillor changed order march walking behind with torrance sending me forward manner scout i went up hill whistling from time time my gaelic air at length i had pleasure hear it answered see alan rise from behind bush he was somewhat dashed spirits having passed long day alone skulking county made but poor meal alehouse near dundas but at mere sight my clothes he began brighten up as soon as i had told him what forward state our matters were part i looked him play what remained he sprang into new man that is very good notion yours says he i dare say that you could lay your hands upon no better man put it through than alan breck it is not thing mark ye that any one could do but takes gentleman penetration but it sticks my head your lawyer man will be somewhat wearying see me says alan accordingly i cried waved on mr rankeillor who came up alone was presented my friend mr thomson mr thomson i am pleased meet you said he but i have forgotten my glasses our friend mr david here clapping me on shoulder will tell you that i am little better than blind that you must not be surprised if i pass you by morrow this he said thinking that alan would be pleased but highlandman s vanity was ready startle at less matter than that why sir says he stiffly i would say it mattered less as we are met here for particular end see justice done mr balfour by what i can see not very likely have much else common but i accept your apology which was very proper one make that is more than i could look for mr thomson said rankeillor heartily now as you i are chief actors this enterprise i think we should come into nice agreement which end i propose that you should lend me your arm for what with dusk want my glasses i am not very clear as path as for you mr david you will find torrance pleasant kind body speak with only let me remind you it s quite needless he should hear more your adventures or those ahem mr thomson accordingly these two went on ahead very close talk torrance i brought up rear night was quite come when we came view house shaws ten had been gone some time it was dark mild with pleasant rustling wind south west that covered sound our approach as we drew near we saw no glimmer light any portion building it seemed my uncle was already bed which was indeed best thing for our arrangements we made our last whispered consultations some fifty yards away then lawyer torrance i crept quietly up crouched down beside corner house as soon as we were our places alan strode door without concealment began knock chapter xxix i come into my kingdom for some time alan volleyed upon door his knocking only roused echoes house neighbourhood at last however i could hear noise window gently thrust up knew that my uncle had come his observatory by what light there was he would see alan standing like dark shadow on steps three witnesses were hidden quite out his view so that there was nothing alarm honest man his own house for all that he studied his visitor awhile silence when he spoke his voice had quaver misgiving what s this says he this is nae kind time night for decent folk i hae nae trokings 34 wi night hawks what brings ye here i have blunderbush 34 dealings is that yoursel mr balfour returned alan stepping back looking up into darkness have care that blunderbuss they re nasty things burst what

sure it s what ye would like i ll set it tune sing it you what is t asked my uncle david says alan what was that cried my uncle mighty changed voice shall i give ye rest name then said alan there was pause then i m thinking i ll better let ye says my uncle doubtfully i dare say that said alan but point is would i go now i will tell you what i am thinking i am thinking that it is here upon this doorstep that we must confer upon this business it shall be here or nowhere at all whatever for i would have you understand that i am as stiffnecked as yoursel gentleman better family this change note disconcerted ebenezer he was little while digesting it then says he weel weel what must be must shut window but it took him long time get down stairs still longer undo fastenings repenting i dare say taken with fresh claps fear at every second step every bolt bar at last however we heard creak hinges it seems my uncle slipped gingerly out seeing that alan had stepped back pace or two sate him down on top doorstep with blunderbuss ready his hands now says he mind i have my blunderbush if ye take step nearer ye re as good as deid very civil speech says alan be sure na says my uncle but this is no very chanty kind proceeding i m bound be prepared now that we understand each other ye ll can name your business why says alan you that are man so much understanding will doubtless have perceived that

just this way says alan my friends would doubtless keep your nephew as long as there was any likelihood siller be made it but if there was nane i am clearly opinion they would let him gang where he pleased be damned him ay but i m no very caring about that either said my uncle i wouldnae be muckle made up with that i was thinking that said alan what for why asked ebenezer why mr balfour replied alan by all that i could hear there were two ways it either ye liked david would pay get him back or else ye had very good reasons for not wanting him would pay for us keep him it seems it s not first well then it s second blythe am i ken it for it should be pretty penny my pocket pockets my friends i dinnae follow ye there said my uncle no said alan well see here you dinnae want lad back well what

said i it s braw nicht mr balfour added torrance never word said my uncle neither black nor white but just sat where he was on top door step stared upon us like man turned stone alan filched away his blunderbuss lawyer taking him by arm plucked him up from doorstep led him into kitchen whither we all followed set him down chair beside hearth where fire was out only rush light burning there we all looked upon him for while exulting greatly our success but yet with sort pity for man s shame come come mr ebenezer said lawyer you must not be down hearted for i promise you we shall make easy terms

charles or is it george perhaps why should it be any three sir quoth alan drawing himself up like one who smelt offence only sir that you mentioned king s name replied rankeillor as there has never yet been king thomson or his fame at least has never come my way i judged you must refer that you had baptism this was just stab that alan would feel keenest i am free confess he took it very ill not word would he answer but stepped off far end kitchen sat down sulked it was not till i stepped after him gave him my hand thanked him by title as chief spring my success that he began smile bit was at last prevailed upon join our party by that time we had fire lighted bottle wine uncorked good supper came out basket which torrance i alan set ourselves down while lawyer my uncle passed into next
